{"title": "My recent reads - 3", "date": "Monday 1 June 2020", "text": "I am currently trying to catch up on reviews featuring books I've read over the last few months (some a bit further back than that). So yes, use of the word ‘recent’ may be a little misleading!The Bad Place by M.K. Hill[Review copy]An excellent start to a new series by M.K. Hill. It was a welcome change to meet a female 'middle-aged' protagonist in a police procedural. DI Sasha Dawson is juggling a demanding family life (interfering mother, stroppy teenagers and depressed husband - known as living in the 'sandwich generation'!) with a hectic career and workload. The plot explores a kidnapping twenty years ago, with questions remaining about what happened to the five teenagers who eventually escaped to safety from 'The Bad Place' - and why the sixth ended up dead. This is linked to the present-day kidnapping of a teenage girl, the author expertly weaving the two stories together while also revealing details of the teenagers (now adults) involved. Looking forward to the next book in the series and seeing how the character of DI Dawson develops.After the End by Clare Mackintosh[Review copy]I read this several months ago and never wrote a review. I am fascinated by the 'sliding doors' concept - the 'what ifs' of life, which path to choose ... and how great it would be if you knew all of the outcomes before making any decisions. But sadly life can't be like that. After the End does give that opportunity to readers though - following the lives of Max and Pip after they have to make a tough decision regarding their young son's health, looking at the outcome of both main options. This book explores the heartbreaking decisions that so many people have to make about themselves or family members - guided by their instinct, love and grief along with often-conflicting medical science. The narrative is split between Max, Pip and the doctor involved in their son's care, filling the pages with their thoughts and emotions. When the parents can't make a decision, it's left to the courts to decide. The thought-provoking book made me cry, but it also gave me hope. It is very different from Clare Mackintosh's other books so far, proving her versatility as an author.Cruel Acts by Jane CaseyThe Cutting Place by Jane Casey[Review copies]I am reviewing Cruel Acts and The Cutting Place together; while these are two very different books in terms of plot, they still feature the same characters that I know and love! I am a huge fan of Jane Casey's Maeve Kerrigan series, following the sparky relationship between Maeve and Derwent, but hadn't managed to catch up on the latest books - until now.Cruel Acts investigates the conviction of Leo Stone for the murder of two young women and whether he is now responsible for the murder of a third after his release. The Cutting Place covers important contemporary issues, such as white male privilege and domestic violence.Jane Casey's books are brutal and witty (the dialogue drives the plot), honest and raw. She handles dark themes with sensitivity and care while leading her readers on a twisty path. The Cutting Place, in particular, focuses as much on the main characters' lives as the case they are trying to investigate, with a few shocking scenes and further revelations. Other characters, such as Maeve and Derwent's colleague Georgia Shaw, are also now being thrust more into the limelight.The Wailing Woman by Maria Lewis(Review copy]A welcome change of genre for me as I was struggling to choose my next crime read. This Romeo-and-Juliet 'urban fantasy' novel features (mainly) banshees, witches and werewolves, with romance, magic, mystery and a touch of action thriller. I read this quickly, enjoying the chance to immerse myself in another world - great escapism at the present time. I haven't read any of the author's previous books, but believe that these feature some of the same characters. This book begins in Australia and ends in London, England. As well as a coming-of-age novel, this read as a 'me too' book, with potentially dangerous women who have been dominated for centuries finally finding their voices - literally, in one case. Great fun.That's all for now! Back soon with some more recommended reads. Keep safe and well, everyone!"},
{"title": "My recent reads - 2", "date": "Tuesday 19 May 2020", "text": "I am currently trying to catch up on reviews featuring books I've read over the last few months.A Deathly Silence by Jane Isaac(Review copy]While I have read several of Jane Isaac's books, but this was my first introduction to the DCI Helen Lavery series. A Deathly Silence is a gripping police procedural, with a chilling mystery at its heart. I was drawn into the story (and characters) straight away, proving that this book can easily be read as a standalone. I love Jane Isaac's writing - it is so vivid that her descriptions leap out from the page - and her characters always seem very real, with their emotions becoming as important to the plot as the investigations themselves.A Bit of a Stretch: The Diaries of a Prisoner by Chris Atkins[Review copy]This was a fascinating yet shocking first-hand account of an insider's guide to the prison system. Chris Atkins, a documentary maker, was sentenced to five years after becoming involved in an illegal tax scheme - he spent the first nine months imprisoned at HMP Wandsworth. The book was a real eye-opener into some of the horrors of prison life, from the dilapidated buildings and endless bureaucracy to the mental health issues and addictions affecting prisoners today. I found it heartbreaking yet also entertaining at times, sad yet also enlightening. The book highlights the urgent need for prison reform.Holdout by Graham Moore[Review copy]The Holdout had me hooked from the start. A clever premise underlies this legal thriller and whodunnit - definitely one for the big screen.  The book features a diverse cast of characters, including a strong female protagonist, all centred around a jury on a murder trial. The main narrative follows present-day events, as a 10-year-old murder case is revisited, with new questions about whether the original suspect was guilty or not guilty. Then there are flashbacks that flesh out the jury characters and explore the decisions they made ten years ago, and why. Lots of twists, turns, shocks and surprises expose the complexities (and pitfalls) of the American legal system.The Warehouse by Rob Hart[Bought]I bought this from Goldsboro Books on the recommendation of a friend who said it was definitely worth reading. At times, this near-future thriller felt a bit too real in the current no-high-street or limited-high-street situation and the reliance on online sales. It focuses on 'Cloud' - an online store that is determined to make the world a better place in a harsh political and economic environment ravaged by climate change. It's a satirical, but also worrying, exploration of the rise of consumerism. I was left with a few unanswered questions, but the world building was thorough and believable. Pure escapism - though maybe a little too close for comfort right now!That's all for now! Back soon with some more recommended reads. Keep safe and well everyone!"},
{"title": "The Priest and the Lily - a guest post by Sanjida O'Connell", "date": "Monday 18 May 2020", "text": "Today, I am delighted to welcome Sanjida O'Connell to Off-the-Shelf Books to talk about the background to her novel, The Priest and the Lily.The Priest and the LilyBy Sanjida O'ConnellMany of our most common and beautiful garden plants have come from far-flung locations throughout the world, brought to us by intrepid explorers who have literally risked life and limb in their search for the rare and exotic. Our gladioli originally came from South Africa, rhododendrons from the Himalayas, the monkey puzzle tree is indigenous to Chile, the regal lily was discovered in China and many of our most exquisite orchids originate in the Amazon. The stories of some of these men - for they were mostly men - who travelled the world in search of flowers, and got themselves into scrapes - attacked by bandits, gored by a bull, capsized from a canoe, fell off a cliff - inspired my story, The Priest and the Lily.Set in 1865, just after Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species, on his radical theory of evolution, The Priest and the Lily is about a Jesuit priest, Joseph Jacobs, who sets sail from Bristol for Outer Mongolia. Joseph, passionate, idealistic and driven, wants to discover rare plants and animals and make a name for himself in scientific circles back in Britain. The young priest is accompanied by a Buddhist monk and a horseman; as they travel across the steppes, he hears stories of an astonishingly beautiful white lily. Finding this lily becomes his dream. But to discover where it grows, he will encounter many dangers, for he will have to face the savagery of the White Warlord, a Chinese General intent on seizing power in Mongolia, as well as the far more powerful Yolros lama, the living incarnation of the Buddha. And in his quest for the lily, Joseph will meet a woman who will show him something far more precious than a flower. I spent years researching my story - and travelled to Outer Mongolia, where I had my own mini adventure. We were due to spend three weeks travelling by jeep and horseback in order to meet the tribe I was going to write about in my novel. Unfortunately, my luggage ended up in Russia, and I had to set off in just the clothes I was wearing! Thankfully I was wearing my walking boots!Mongolia is stunning: it is a country of seemingly endless skies and steppes, with incredibly hospitable people. At the time of writing this blog, we’re in the grip of COVID-19, and everyone in the UK as well as many other countries, is currently in lockdown at home. I hope that my novel can, in some small way, help take our minds off this situation, transporting us to a country and a time far from our own immediate experience, and perhaps, too, allow us to appreciate what Joseph comes to realise - that it is love, which is more important than anything else on this earth.             About Sanjida O'ConnellSanjida O’Connell is a novelist. She writes psychological thrillers under the pseudonym, Sanjida Kay.Find Sanjida on her website and on Twitter - @SanjidaKayAbout The Priest and the LilyThe Priest and the LilyBy Sanjida O'ConnellDescriptionIn 1865, Joseph, a young Jesuit priest and plant-hunter, sets out on a dangerous journey through Outer Mongolia, a land virtually unknown to the Western world. Charles Darwin’s radical theory of evolution has just been published, and Joseph is driven by his passion for science and his love of God. As he crosses the Mongolia Steppes with a Buddhist monk and a local horseman, he hears rumours of a rare and beautiful white lily. He believes that if he finds this flower, his fame and fortune will be assured. But then Joseph meets Namuunaa, a shaman and the chief of her tribe. And it is Namuunaa who will teach him the true meaning of his desire… 'You will journey far beyond the boundaries of your imagination. You will meet and seize your heart’s desire.It will be the death of your soul.'An epic journey, a story of East meeting West, and of a love that transcends culture, faith and ultimately tragedy.The Priest and the Lily is available to buy from Amazon here"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Bevan Frank", "date": "Wednesday 13 May 2020", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome BEVAN FRANKto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSThere are several authors competing for my top spot but I would say it has to go to Dan Brown, who was catapulted to fame with The Da Vinci Code. All of his books are gripping and draw the reader inward. Brown’s ability to create suspense and cleverly merge the boundaries between fiction and reality is inspirational. ... FILMS/MOVIESMartin Scorsese’s The Departed – I am drawn to it and find myself watching it again and again. It has an excellent script and a great cast. ... TV DRAMASIf I look back on my early (earlier) years, Magnum P.I. with Tom Selleck was brilliant. Even today I still enjoy watching episodes again of Magnum and his friends solving crimes, so much so that I’ve always wanted to name my house ‘Robin’s Nest’ after the Hawaiian estate where Magnum lived, but my wife won’t hear of it. (As she constantly points out, my name is not Robin!)If I am to consider ‘modern times’, then the best crime drama is a tie between The Sopranos and Money Heist (narrowly edging out Better Call Saul). They are all nothing short of brilliant, with characters and plots that linger long after I’ve switched off the remote control. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSKeyser Söze from Christopher McQuarrie’s The Usual Suspects. It’s a well-crafted story and I love the fact that the killer could be just another regular guy in the room with us. Someone you least suspect but someone who is calling the shots, someone with a brilliant mind able to hide himself from scrutiny while terrorising all who cross his path. Keyser Sözeis the perfect villain.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES While not a formal detective, Robert Langdon from Dan Brown’s books is a super-sleuth of note, trying to make sense of whatever is thrown his way as he gets to the bottom of deciphering clues, solving problems and saving the day.... MURDER WEAPONSWhat still stands out for me is Michael Crichton’s Prey, where the villain creates nanobots (made of nanoparticles) which evolve into clouds of autonomous intelligent swarms and become a lethal killing machine.... DEATH SCENESWithout wanting to give anything away, a major death scene in Stieg Larsson’s The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo springs to mind. Here the person is fleeing in a car and crashes into a fuel tanker. After being stuck underneath it, the tanker then explodes. It took me by surprise!... BLOGS/WEBSITESI don’t have a specific website for writing or research. I do, however, recommend the book Immediate Fiction by Jerry Cleaver. It gives great tips on setting scenes, creating memorable characters and writing books generally. It also gives ways to overcome writer’s block (or ‘writer’s stuckness’ as I was once told to rather call it!) The book was an invaluable resource which helped me get to the finish line when writing my thriller.... WRITING TIPSWrite for 10 minutes every day, even if you’re just writing rubbish! The premise is that this eventually becomes an ingrained habit. Everyone has 10 minutes in their day to follow their dreams. I used the ‘10 minutes a day’ concept to write The Mind of God. Some days if I was in the flow the 10 minutes became 20 minutes or 30 minutes etc. After one year I had a substantial nucleus on which to build. You’ll be surprised at how much you can do in these little gaps. ... WRITING SNACKSBefore my stroke, tea. Since my stroke, coffee. And always salted caramel ice-cream and lots of chocolate. And a bottle of whiskey on stand-by!About BEVAN FRANKBevan Frank has a BA degree in English and Political Studies as well as a postgraduate LLB law degree, both from the University of Cape Town. After qualifying as an attorney Bevan decided to follow his passion and opted down the path of writing and editing. He has worked as a business magazine editor, journalist, writer, plain language practitioner and communications consultant. His articles have been published in numerous publications locally and globally. Bevan lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and children. The Mind of God is his award-winning debut novel.

On the same day, President of the United States Daniel Rafferty is in Cape Town to give an address at the Convention Centre. Is it a coincidence that the black box was stolen while Rafferty is in the same city, or is there an even more sinister terrorist plot at play?

{"title": "My recent reads - 1", "date": "Tuesday 28 April 2020", "text": "Like many people at the moment, I'm struggling to concentrate on reading, even though this used to be my main form of escapism. I'm also struggling to write reviews in any great detail. But when particular books manage to retain my attention, I do want to recommend them. So I am going to write some short reviews on here.Hopefully once life returns to some form of 'new normal' and my anxiety and concentration levels settle down, my words will flow again. Watch out for this new series of posts, featuring a few books at a time.The Toy Makers by Robert DinsdaleI raced through this fairytale, which is set around the time of WW1. It involved embracing the magical element and immersing myself in the story. I thought it was beautifully written, cleverly plotted and very emotional, about love, war and family relationships. My OH picked it up after me and I don't think I have ever seen him read a book so quickly!Midnight at the Bright Ideas Bookstore by Matthew SullivanThis is an intriguing, intelligent mystery. I found it difficult to put down, and loved everything about it, from the characters to the setting (a bookstore - how can anyone not love that?) and the compelling plot. It is an easy read (some people may call it 'quiet' crime novel) but also a very twisty (and clever) one, featuring secrets from the past, with a horrific killing and a suicide at the heart of it.The Holiday by T.M. LoganI have been meaning to read this book for ages and finally took it off my shelf when the author's next book (The Catch) arrived in the post. It's a psychological thriller (domestic noir) set in blazing sunshine in a Mediterranean paradise - perfect escapism from my current location. This is a gripping read, all about family dynamics, friendships and the hazards of parenting teenagers. It kept me guessing to the end and now I'm looking forward to reading The Catch.The Flower Girls by Alice Clark-PlattsThis is another book that's been lying around here for a while, and I am glad that I chose to read it now, as it proved to be great escapism. It's a very dark and disturbing story about two children, one convicted of murder and the other given a new identity, following the killing of an even younger child. I found myself trying to analyse the two main characters and their motives and personalities. The book explores the justice system, the nature of 'evil' and childhood trauma, and features a brilliant ending!That's all for now! Back soon with some more recommended reads. Keep safe and well, everyone!"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Jonathan Pinnock ", "date": "Monday 27 April 2020", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome JONATHAN PINNOCKto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSI’m very much looking forward to whatever Gillian Flynn comes up with next, because Gone Girl was such a wild, mad ride. But in the meantime – and this might be cheating slightly, because they’re strictly speaking spy stories, but then again I don’t have a lot of time for genre boundaries – I’m currently working my way through Mick Herron’s Slough House series, and they are an absolutely marvel. Imagine looking at Le Carré and thinking “Nah, way too upbeat.”If I can be ever so slightly pretentious for a moment, I’d also like to chuck in a third preference vote for Jorge Luis Borges, if only for Death and the Compass, which is possibly the single greatest crime short story ever written. As I’m sure everyone knows, the central conceit was borrowed by Umberto Eco for The Name of the Rose, which is why one of the key characters is called Jorge de Burgos. As slightly fewer people know, I also nicked it for The Truth About Archie and Pye, which is why one of my characters has the name George Burgess.OK, OK, I’ll try and keep the answers shorter from now on.... FILMS/MOVIESI’m a massive fan of Raymond Chandler, so it’s got to be The Big Sleep – nothing comes close. But for God’s sake, make sure it’s the original 1946 Howard Hawks version with Bogart and Bacall at the top of their game, not the execrable 1978 Michael Winner remake. I actually paid real money to see this in the cinema when it came out and I’m still angry, over forty years later.... TV DRAMASOoh, this is tricky. Giri/Haji and the first series of Killing Eve are strong contenders, but in the end, it’s got to be The Bridge, or Bron | Broen, as we call it in our household, where we now speak fluent Scandinavian. The first two seasons in particular are wonderful, mainly because of the weird chemistry between Saga Norén and Martin Rohde. Oh, and that theme tune by Choir of Young Believers is just perfect.... FICTIONAL KILLERSWell, I guess Hannibal Lecter is a bit of an obvious choice, so let’s go with Gerry and Sylvia Anderson’s Mysterons, mainly because they were so endearingly useless. At the start of every single episode, they would announce that they were going to kill someone or cause some kind of disaster, and every single time they were thwarted by bloody Captain Scarlet. Hopeless.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I think it would have to be Louie Knight, from Malcolm Pryce’s Aberystwyth Noir series. On the face of it, he’s a pastiche of Philip Marlowe, but there’s so much more going on there. Pryce’s Aberystwyth is a masterpiece of world-building.... MURDER WEAPONSI’m guessing that someone must have mentioned it before in this series, because it’s just so neat, but there’s Roald Dahl’s frozen leg of lamb that a woman uses to bludgeon her husband before serving it to the investigating detective. I also quite like the serial killer in one of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher books, The Visitor, who goes around drowning their victims in their own bathtubs in camouflage paint. Not only is it downright weird, but it’s also preposterously inefficient.... DEATH SCENESMight need to put a mild spoiler alert on this – and possibly a Lionel Shriver alert too – but the conclusion of We Need to Talk About Kevin shocked me much more than I was expecting it to.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m afraid that I’m not a particularly faithful web surfer, and if I’m about to do any research I tend to just start with Google and see where it leads me. My search history can make for interesting reading in itself.... WRITING TIPSMost of all, I’d recommend that you avoid taking advice from strangers on the internet. But if you insist, read widely and outside your genre, make sure all your characters have agency and for God’s sake, listen to how people talk.... WRITING SNACKSI share my life with someone who, if given a two-finger Kit-Kat, will break it in two, eat one finger and carefully re-wrap the remaining one to keep for some future occasion. Maybe next week, or some time the other side of Christmas. I, on the other hand, see a packet of chocolate digestives as an atomic entity, intended to be eaten all in one go if I think I can get away with it. So what I’m basically saying is that I don’t do snacks while writing. They’re far too dangerous.About JONATHAN PINNOCKJonathan Pinnock first came to notoriety as the author of Mrs Darcy Versus the Aliens, of which he should probably be more ashamed than he actually is. He is also the author of two collections of short stories, a slim volume of poetry and an uncategorisable (and – frankly – largely unsaleable) musical memoir. More recently, he is the author of Farrago Books’ Mathematical Mystery series, the third of which, The Riddle of the Fractal Monks, was published on 16 April 2020.Find Jonathan Pinnock on Twitter - @jonpinnockAbout THE RIDDLE OF THE FRACTAL MONKSPublisher's descriptionA mystery lands – literally – at Tom Winscombe’s feet, and another riotous mathematical adventure begins…Tom Winscombe and Dorothy Chan haven’t managed to go on a date for some time, so it’s a shame that their outing to a Promenade Concert is cut short when a mysterious cowled figure plummets from the gallery to the floor of the arena close to where they are standing.

How will other figures from the past also demand a slice of the action? And what other mysteries are there lurking at the bottom of the sea and at the top of mountains?

AUTHORSI don’t often read lots of books by the same author, I have to admit – so it’s difficult to pick a favourite. But when I read the literary thriller Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng I immediately went and bought her debut, Everything I Never Told You. I love both, and have re-read them since. They are such fantastic character studies, such subtle mysteries, and such brilliant explorations of family life.... FILMS/MOVIESI watched Thelma and Louise for the first time the other week and I loved it so much. What a fantastic pair! I loved the way this story develops, and how it’s not your usual crime story – the way you are following the criminals rather than the detectives and see them before their crime, too. And the ending. Oh my God, that ending! I thought it was perfect.... TV DRAMASBreaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul on Netflix is a firm favourite in our house. The only thing that could knock it off the top of our list would be a series about another character, the delightfully paradoxical softie hitman Mike. Come on, Netflix! More Mike Ehrmantraut!... FICTIONAL KILLERSTom Ripley. I only read The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith recently but boy, what a novel. What an amazing, amoral, anti-hero. How the hell does she make you like a murderer? I love books that make me think like this – as a writer I love to try and solve the puzzle of exactly how another author has achieved something bold like this. It shouldn’t work, but it does.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I love Captain Sam Wyndham in Abir Mukherjee’s crime series. He’s an ex-Scotland Yard detective and veteran of the First World War who has been scarred by his experiences and finds himself in Calcutta looking for a fresh start. He and his quick-witted Indian Sergeant, Surrender-not Banerjee, make a great team and I love the historical (1920s) setting of this series.... MURDER WEAPONSA compass point through the jugular and a set square through the heart are two of the murder weapons in Jonathan Pinnock’s very entertaining mathematical mystery The Truth about Archie and Pye. It’s a crime novel that will make you laugh out loud – which is refreshing in this genre! There are two more in the series (the third, The Riddle of the Fractal Monks, comes out in April).... DEATH SCENESThere’s a heart-in-the-mouth, devastating scene in Jane Shemilt’s latest offering, Little Friends, where a lifeless child is discovered. I have a child of a similar age so it really got to me. She builds up to this scene so expertly. It’s a fantastic novel with a great premise – while the adults are misbehaving, what are the children getting up to?  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI love using 16personalities.com to put my characters through rigorous personality tests and understand more about them beyond what I already know. The helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com blog (and podcast) is really helpful when I’m starting to write a book, I find it reading a few posts there helps get my brain into the right gear. And… Facebook! For research, I often ask friends for contacts or advice on there.... WRITING TIPSYou know the phrase: dance like nobody’s watching? Well, I think sometimes it’s worth writing like nobody is reading. What I mean by that is it sometimes helps to just write for yourself. What book do youwant to write? What fun things would you do with your writing if you weren’t worried about how it would be received or judged? Give yourself the freedom to experiment and see what happens – you can always rein yourself in later, but maybe you’ll come up with a brilliant idea when you’re playing around! And while you’re at it, write a few pages every now and then longhand with a colourful felt tip pen. It makes the whole task feel less serious, I find, and less like it matters. You need to feel that sometimes, as a writer – it’s liberating.... WRITING SNACKSA fresh-out-of-the-oven cinnamon bun when I’m working at my local café.

{"title": "Deep Dark Night by Steph Broadribb", "date": "Sunday 22 March 2020", "text": "Deep Dark Night By Steph BroadribbPublished by Orenda Books (5 March 2020)I received an advance reader copy from the publisher Publisher's descriptionA city in darkness. A building in lockdown. A score that can only be settled in blood…Working off the books for FBI Special Agent Alex Monroe, Florida bounty-hunter Lori Anderson and her partner, JT, head to Chicago. Their mission: to entrap the head of the Cabressa crime family. The bait: a priceless chess set that Cabressa is determined to add to his collection.An exclusive high-stakes poker game is arranged in the penthouse suite of one of the city’s tallest buildings, with Lori holding the cards in an agreed arrangement to hand over the pieces, one by one. But, as night falls and the game plays out, stakes rise and tempers flare.When a power failure plunges the city into darkness, the building goes into lockdown. But this isn’t an ordinary blackout, and the men around the poker table aren’t all who they say they are. Hostages are taken, old scores resurface and the players start to die.And that’s just the beginning…My verdictIt feels very apt to publish this book review on Off-the-Shelf Books on Mother's Day in the UK, because Lori Anderson, the protagonist of Deep Dark Night, is very much a devoted mother. She also happens to be a kickass bounty hunter who get herself into various precarious scenarios. And the scenario in Deep Dark Night certainly seems to be her most dangerous one yet.Lori and her partner JT have taken on a high-stakes case that involves not just gambling for money but gambling for their lives. And while everything falls apart around her, all Lori can really think about is getting back safely to her daughter.Deep Dark Night is 'Die Hard on speed', with constant action through skyscraper blackouts, riots in the city and a locked-room mystery. The book sizzles with electricity, taking the reader on a rollercoaster of emotions, yet also has an intense claustrophobic feel to it. It's a brilliant fun one-sitting read that will push your adrenaline levels sky high.Another reason I love this book is that due to its structure JT finally has 'a voice' as we follow his endeavours to keep himself safe, after he and Lori are forced to go their separate ways. Thanks to plenty of cliffhangers followed by a switch in viewpoint, this book constantly left me feeling on edge.This series keeps on getting better and better, with Steph Broadribb expertly creating three-dimensional characters and plots that continue to shock, thrill and entertain. Looking forward to the next one.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Trevor Wood", "date": "Thursday 19 March 2020", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome TREVOR WOODto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSObviously there are loads I love but the well-known ones don’t need any help from me so I’d like to give a shout out to the next big thing, Dominic Nolan. His debut novel Past Life blew me away. Featuring battered cop Abigail Boone, who suffers from total retrograde amnesia after a savage beating and a fall, it’s dark and desperate but beautifully written and deeply moving. The sequel After Dark is even better. If there’s any justice it’ll be a huge hit. ... FILMS/MOVIESI love Dennis Lehane’s books and the movie made from one of them, Gone Baby Gone is nigh on perfect. It provides all the thrills and twists the genre demands but at the heart of it is a moral dilemma that is utterly heartbreaking. The final scene, I’d suggest, is one of the best in crime movie history. It would be much better known if it hadn’t been shelved for a couple of years due to the kidnapped young girl bearing a startling resemblance to Madeleine McCann.... TV DRAMASLine of Duty has been consistently brilliant from the start so that has to get a mention but surely everyone’s seen it now so I’ll throw Spotless out there. It’s a little-known Netflix series about a man who runs a crime scene clean-up crew. Funny, dark with a very scary bad guy. I love it.... FICTIONAL KILLERSMaurice Swift in John Boyne’s A Ladder to the Sky. He’s a bit like Ripley but with the extra twist that he’s a writer who will do anything to get to the top. Great book as well.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Back to Dennis Lehane for this one. Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro are a fantastic pairing of old-school private detectives and their on-off romance is beautifully judged. I read most of the series back to back and it flew by. Start with A Drink Before The War and go from there.... MURDER WEAPONSCarl Hiaasen is the master of bizarre murder weapons. On the grounds of taste I’m going to skip swiftly past the sexually-deviant dolphin in Native Tongue and opt for the stuffed blue marlin head that is used to impale an intruder in Skin Tight.... DEATH SCENESI love the scene in Final Destination 5 where a man is on an acupuncture table with umpteen needles sticking out of his face, torso and legs when an aromatic candle breaks apart and sets fire to some paper. In struggling to escape he flips over the table and falls face first on the floor, driving the needles in and knocking over a bottle of flammable liquid. Somehow he struggles up but the liquid catches fire and the whole room is now ablaze. Again he avoids death by throwing himself to the floor in the one bit of the room not on fire. Then a shelf above him collapses and a large statue of Buddha falls off, crushing his skull.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI was going to say Agent Hunter, which I found invaluable when looking for an agent. It was a comprehensive list of Agencies and Agents with a search facility that enabled you to find the right agent, i.e. one who liked the kind of thing you were writing. It also included links to interviews they’d given which was very useful in deciding who to submit to and what to put in your submission letter. You could also pay a small amount for a trial period which is all you really needed. However, in writing this, I looked it up and found it’s been taken over and is now called Agent Match and you have to pay £30 for a month. It’s still worth it, I think, so my only reservation is that I haven’t tried the new site so can’t recommend it from personal experience. I’m sure it’s still great but it’s probably best to ask around before trying. You can find it here https://jerichowriters.com/agentmatch/... WRITING TIPSThe most on-point advice I ever heard was that you should ‘put your character up a tree and throw rocks at him.’ It’s been attributed to Nabokov but that seems highly unlikely to me. My top tip would be to find people whose judgement you trust to read your work. As many as you like. I’m in a local group of five writers who meet every three weeks. We all submit 2000 words and offer constructive criticism of each other’s work and it improves my writing immeasurably.  Obviously the key word is ‘constructive.’ If you can’t find a local group, form your own. The crime-writing MA I attended at UEA had a similar peer feedback model and that was where The Man on the Street came from so I can’t recommend it highly enough.... WRITING SNACKSDoes wine count? If not, then fruit. Working from home, with very easy access to the fridge can be problematic so I try very hard not to snack on anything less healthy as I put on weight way too easily. Also coffee.

AUTHORSThis changes all the time, but today, I’m going with Raymond Chandler for verve, style and wit. He creates a world that is all his own, with the sure rhythm of a jazz soloist.... FILMS/MOVIESMaybe it’s because I’m writing about the 80s, but I think the courtroom thriller Jagged Edge – with Glenn Close and Jeff Bridges, is very satisfying. There’s no better sound than hearing a whole cinema gasp as the clue is revealed that changes everything. With a terrifying score by John Barry and some excellent tailoring.... TV DRAMASThe Killing was the first Nordic noir I ever watched, and I think has never been bettered. A series leaves room for subtleties in the way a film can’t. I loved the workaday slog of a long case, with all its false triumphs and reversals. There was also an interesting focus of the family of the murdered girl and the damage they endured. Perhaps there’s something about having to read subtitles that means your attention is particularly undivided.... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’ll always have a soft spot for Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley. I read The Talented Mr Ripley as a teenager and it threw me into moral confusion when I realised I was hoping he would get away with it all. He sees himself as a victim of circumstance. I think a lot of people who do bad things see themselves as victims.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I think the detective I have loved most is Sara Peretsky’s VI Warshawski. She was the first detective I had read who was out there on her own, smart, tough and self-reliant, fighting abuses of power, but with a lovingly described ordinary life. She did the laundry, loved her food and walked the neighbour’s dogs – everywoman and superhero. ... MURDER WEAPONSA hatpin has definite appeal, something small, stylish and deadly.... DEATH SCENESThere is an amazing murder scene in Denise Mina’s Blood, Salt, Water where a hired thug has to kill a woman. The woman is annoying, the thug is full of self-loathing. It’s such an emotionally powerful scene, drenched in pity for the waste of it all.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’ve become reliant on watching archive film clips on YouTube. While newspaper and magazine archives are hugely useful for the facts of things, there is nothing like seeing the era you are writing about – the clothes people wore, what the shops are selling – to put you right back there. It amazes me that there are dozens of home videos that people took of themselves, just driving around Dublin in the 1980s. It’s a magic portal!... WRITING TIPSWork makes work. That is, when you are in the midst of writing, the best ideas come. It’s no use waiting for inspiration to strike (though walks and baths can be useful strategems), you have to wrestle your way into your prose and work from there. Also, I have the Freedom app on my computer for when the willpower is weak.... WRITING SNACKSNo snacks at the desk!

AUTHORSStephen King. I may be starting off on the wrong foot by naming an author who, strictly speaking, isn’t a crime writer, but growing up I read through much of King’s back catalogue. His short story collections and supernatural tales of small-town America have always been an inspiration for my own writing. ... FILMS/MOVIESFilm noir as a genre is a favorite for me, and Bogart playing Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep is pretty hard to beat. The more contemporary L.A. Confidential would be a close second. ... TV DRAMASThe Wire is without a doubt my favourite TV crime drama, portraying the bleak realities of inner-city drug violence with a superb cast of humorous, diverse and flawed characters. With two British actors in Dominic West and Idris Elba, arguably giving their best on screen performances, the show doesn’t put a foot wrong throughout all five series.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThis is a hard one, as I don’t tend to focus on killers in crime fiction. Patrick Bateman from American Psycho springs to mind; the psychotic, Manhattan businessman is wholly unhinged, consumed by materialism and the constant competitive world of Wall Street. He idolises Donald Trump as well, which says a lot. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’m returning to The Wire with Detective Kima Greggs, played brilliantly by Sonja Sohn. A brilliant, complex character, who literally had me sat on the edge of my seat towards the end of series one (without giving away any spoilers, I’ll just say I was very worried for Kima).  ... MURDER WEAPONSThe captive bolt stunner used by Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Menis rather unique, and has the added bonus of being a neat tool to break door locks. ... DEATH SCENESPurely for the philosophical headache it caused as I spent an evening rereading and considering it, I’ll have to go with the assassination of General Kaplan in Philip K. Dick’s The Minority Report.Though the scene itself is far from the most shocking anyone will ever read, the questions it raises regarding predeterminism and personal autonomy are brilliant, reflecting the author’s utter genius.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThere’s not one specific website I rely on too heavily, but as I write historical crime fiction, I try to look for blogs and sites run by former police officers, dedicated to the history of the police force. As a result, I’ve been lucky enough to get in touch with some very kind and knowledgeable people.... WRITING TIPSFor aspiring writers, particularly writing a first novel, find a manageable, achievable daily word count and stick to it until you type THE END. Some days the words come easy and some days they are hard to find, but an imperfect first draft is far better than a perfect blank page. ...

A young girl by the name of Betsan Tilny has been found murdered in the woodland – her body bound and horribly burnt. But the crime scene appears to have been staged, and worse still: the locals are reluctant to help.As the strange case unfolds, Thomas senses a growing presence watching him, and try as he may, the villagers seem intent on keeping their secret. Then one night, in the grip of a fever, he develops the photographic plates from the crime scene in a makeshift darkroom in the cellar of his lodgings. There, he finds a face dimly visible in the photographs; a face hovering around the body of the dead girl – the face of Betsan Tilny.A Shadow on the Lens was published by Orion on 5 September 2019.Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},
{"title": "Purged by Peter Laws", "date": "Monday 24 February 2020", "text": "This week's buzz is all about Possessed by Peter Laws, which has just been published by Allison & Busby. If you want to know more about Possessed, follow the #Possessed hashtag and visit @sjroth21 on Twitter (https://stephsbookblog.com) tomorrow.Rather than read Possessed straightaway, I decided to visit this series where it all began - with Purged, the first Matt Hunter book.PurgedBy Peter LawsPublished by Allen & BusbyPublisher's descriptionMatt Hunter lost his faith a long time ago. Formerly a minister, now a professor of sociology, he's writing a book that debunks the Christian faith while assisting the police with religiously motivated crimes. On holiday with his family in Oxfordshire, Matt finds himself on edge in a seemingly idyllic village where wooden crosses hang at every turn. The stay becomes more sinister still when a local girl goes missing, followed by further disappearances. Caught up in an investigation that brings memories to the surface that he would prefer stay buried deep, Matt is on the trail of a killer determined to save us all.My verdictI love creepy crime fiction, and Purged certainly didn't disappoint. The book begins with a disturbing scene and a great introduction to Matt Hunter, a former minister who is now an academic and assists the police with crimes motivated by religion.Purged combines horror and murder mystery in a small-community setting, a village teeming with religion. Two women have disappeared, followed by a third, and the local church is at the centre of the investigations.The book is well written with a well-developed plot. The author uses his own experience as a church minister to explore what happens when religion is taken to extremes. But rather than take everything too seriously, there's an enjoyable mix of humour and darkness. While there's more crime than horror in Purged, it certainly has a creepy vibe to it, with some very visual - and often disturbing - imagery. Matt is not only likeable but also believable, a family man with tragic events in his own past. And he certainly makes a change from the flawed police detective found in many other crime novels.Purged is a great first novel and I found myself racing through it to the end. I enjoyed it so much that I've already bought the next book in the series!Read the seriesThere are now four books: Purged, Unleashed, Severed and Possessed. Here is more information on the other three.UnleashedFifteen years ago, 29 Barley Street in Menham, south London became notorious as the scene of alleged poltergeist activity and then as a crime scene with the death of young Holly Wasson. The shadow cast by this episode is still felt in the town, and among the gang of friends who were caught up in the tragic events. That shadow looms larger than ever when one of the group dies in horrific and strange circumstances.Matt Hunter, former church minister and now university professor, is called in to advise the police on the possible ritualistic elements of the death. And he is forced to ask himself, are forces beyond the grave at work or is a flesh-and-blood killer at large?SeveredDuring a Communion service, the teenage son of the vicar brutally attacks his father with an axe in full view of the congregation. A frantic police search for the boy follows as rumours circulate that he was involved in devil worship. Atheist ex-minister Professor Matt Hunter is brought in to advise, yet he soon suspects the cause is far more complex than first thought.Elsewhere, a ten-year-old boy, Ever, grows up in a small cult who believe they are the only true humans left and that the world is filled with demons. Harnessing the powers of a bizarre ritual they hope to bring peace and paradise to the world.Soon the worlds of Matt and Ever will collide in one terrifying and murderous night...PossessedWhen an unidentified and blood-soaked man is discovered with the name Baal-Berith scored into his flesh, Professor Matt Hunter is called in by the bewildered local police. As an atheist ex-minister and expert on religion, Matt can shed light on the ancient Canaanite demon known as the spirit of blasphemy and murder, but as he's drawn into a frenzied murder investigation, a fury of media interest and a TV show documenting a mass exorcism, the situation follows a much murkier path. Striving to provide balance to the show's increasingly sensational tone and rational support for the vulnerable 'clients', Matt cannot leave, even as events get seriously out of hand..."},

AUTHORSI'm choosing two current authors with multiple books because this is so hard any other way! I’ve loved Tana French for her gorgeous, atmospheric writing and dark themes. And Ruth Ware for her wonderful, timeless mysteries which sweep me away. ... FILMS/MOVIESThe adaptation of Gone Girl was superb. Deliciously dark and tense. I also think Drive counts as a crime movie and it’s shocking, powerful and incredibly atmospheric. Loved it, in a flinching-at-the-violence kind of way. ... TV DRAMASThe Killing.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Helen Sedgwick", "date": "Thursday 9 January 2020", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome HELEN SEDGWICKto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSKate Atkinson is one of my favourites, as is Sophie Hannah – I like my crime with a strong dose of feminism, intersecting narratives and multiple points of view.... FILMS/MOVIESI love crime films that are offbeat and genre bending – the deep black quirkiness of Fargo, the folk horror genius of Wicker Man. ... TV DRAMASIt’s got to be Twin Peaks for me. The subversion of the supernatural colliding with the police procedural, the stunning visual style and soundtrack, the innovative and unsettling use of pace… Twin Peaks all the way!... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’m going to choose a killer who’s drawn with such humanity you can’t help but understand why: Roy Batty from Blade Runner.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES My childhood favourite was always Sherlock Holmes. Perhaps it was for his mix of intense logic and bohemian eccentricity or – more likely – his absolute refusal to tone himself down in order to make anyone else comfortable.... MURDER WEAPONSI like poisoning with weirdly beautiful and highly toxic plants, stabbing with glistening icicles, and the idea of leaving people to float alone in space.     ... DEATH SCENESYou never see an actual death, but Janice Galloway’s short story The Meat is horrific and chilling and, once read, will never be forgotten.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI love wild, frozen places, so I’d recommend the British Antarctic Survey blogs to give a real sense of what it must be like living on the remotest place on earth.... WRITING TIPSGo with your instincts, read and write and keep writing – and don’t waste too much time on social media.... WRITING SNACKSAt the very least there’ll be a large mug of tea and a small mug of very strong coffee on the desk at any one time. I grow vegetables and love to munch on fresh pea shoots, alongside salted caramel chocolate.About HELEN SEDGWICKHelen Sedgwick is the author of The Comet Seekers, selected as a best book of 2016 by the Herald, and The Growing Season, shortlisted for the Saltire Society Fiction Book of the Year in 2018.

It’s not long before they uncover a maelstrom of racism, misogyny and homophobia. But there’s worse to come.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Mario Theodorou", "date": "Thursday 19 December 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome MARIO THEODOROUto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSArthur Conan Doyle. I just love the Sherlock set up and the way he launches into each caper without it feeling like we’re being hurried along. Stylistically and tonally, Doyle’s books and short stories are mesmerizing, and they always feel fresh and original regardless of their age or how many times I’ve read them. ... FILMS/MOVIESThis is tough. I’m a huge film fan and love crime films from every decade. With a gun to my head, I’d have to say Training Day. I love everything about this film. It’s real lesson in how to write memorable characters and tie them to plot. I’ve never wanted a bad guy to win so much in my life. ... TV DRAMASAgain, there are a lot of great crime dramas. I’m a fan of the original Prime Suspect, although it’s a bit dated now. I loved The Wire, Breaking Bad and Sherlock, of course. But I’d have to say that the first series of True Detective takes it for me. Very twisty, with great performances, and that edge of discomfort and anticipation throughout.... FICTIONAL KILLERSPatrick Bateman. What a revelation. A wealthy, high-flying, perfectionist who kills to alleviate his feelings of inadequacy and self-hatred. He’s so complex. Everything he does is a response to how people make him feel about himself. Even though his crimes are horrific, you always know emotionally where his mind is at before he commits them, which scarily allows you to relate. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’d have to say Matthew Shardlake. It's not often that the protagonist is a hunchbacked lawyer. Shardlake’s unthreatening demeanour perfectly disguises his incredible mind, which is a set up that really appeals to me. I love that whole series. ... MURDER WEAPONSI’m a fan of the elaborate weapons in Greek Mythology and the dual symbolism. The staff of Hermes, entwined with serpents, Kronus’s Scythe, Hade’s Bident… but my favorite has to be the Tunic of Nessus. The poisoned shirt that caused the death of Heracles. It has since come to represent destruction, ruin and misfortune, from which there is no escape. Beats a knife.     ... DEATH SCENESHas to be Game of Thrones. The scene when the Mountain crushes Prince Oberyn’s head like a watermelon. It was absolutely shocking visually, but also emotionally. We are not used to seeing our heroes lose to the bad guy, and not in such a horrific way. The shock value was incredible. I thought about it for days.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI like true crime websites and podcasts. I read all the news websites too. Anything about people and what motivates them really, which can come from anywhere. I’m also forever on Wiki, legal websites and The Metropolitan Police’s website, making sure that I know all the procedural elements to an investigation.... WRITING TIPSI mostly write for TV and Film and find a lot of the tools available to screenwriters help make writing novels more visual.In terms of a good writing resource, I like, helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com – I find the character ghost section very useful. Top tips would be to make sure your character arcs are meaningful. People care about people in the end, not elaborate plots. If you can do both, then perfect! Also, if you feel it’s not working for any reason, step away, go for a walk, figure it out away from the screen and then come back. I solve all my puzzles away from the computer.... WRITING SNACKSAnything that gives you energy. I eat lots of almonds and drink lots of green tea.About MARIO THEODOROUMario Theodorou is an award winning, London based writer. He first came to prominence after being discovered by Merman Films who optioned his original comedy series, Conny. A script commission from Sky followed for The Master Forger, before he was selected by the BBC for their prestigious writer's programme. He has since been named in the BBC top emerging talent list and has released The Cyprus Missing, a single drama for BBC Radio 4 and Anonymous, his Soho based short film which picked up numerous awards on the film festival circuit, including a nomination for the Short Film Award at the Academy Award qualifying, Austin Film Festival. Represented by WME, Mario is currently working on a number of projects, including an original commission for BBC Drama and other original works in development with BBC Studios, Twelve Town, Riff Raff, Sprout Pictures, Tiger Aspect, Vox Pictures, Sevenseas Films, Unstoppable TV and Mainstreet Pictures. Felix Grey and the Descendant is Mario’s first novel, and the first in a series of planned works.Find Mario Theodorou on his website and on Twitter - @MarioTheodorouAbout FELIX GREY AND THE DESCENDANTPublisher's description1904. Three years since the death of Queen Victoria and the ascension of her son, Edward VII to the throne. In that time, the decline of the British Empire has accelerated, the econ-omy has stuttered, Captain Scott has gone to the South Pole, and Liberal politician, Felix Grey has been parachuted into Number Ten on the crest of a populist wave. The third youngest Prime Minister in history and the son of a Suffragette, Felix is modern and pro-gressive, but also inexperienced, self-deprecating and doubtful. Having taken on the Conservative old guard in the House of Commons, Felix has found his policies continually blocked and his time in power dogged by his inability to affect any real change. However, when a member of the House of Lords is abducted from the East India Club, and a mysterious card is discovered, Felix begins to feel a sense of purpose again. Against his better judgement, and that of his loyal steward, Humphrey, Felix begins to dig into the card and the missing Lord, desperate to be of service to the people he rep-resents. With public approval disappearing under a spate of fatal factory disasters, and the emer-gence of the German and American economies making the front pages, Felix’s premier-ship is suddenly under attack from all sides. When another Lord is abducted, Felix begins to escalate his investigation, determined to uncover the truth. With suspicious links to fel-low members of Parliament and a period synonymous with British history, Felix has to fight off his enemies, unmask the perpetrators, find the missing Lords and solve the case, all whilst protecting his identity and preserving his position as the British Prime Minister.Felix Grey and the Descendant was published on 11 December 2019.I proofread this book and loved it, which is why I invited Mario to do Best of Crime. This isn't something I usually do when I proofread books for authors! But Felix Grey is a fabulous protagonist and this book is great fun to read!Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},

These are books that have wowed me with their beautiful writing, compelling or fast-paced plots, intriguing characters and/or great sense of place.I haven't read vast numbers of books this year. In case you haven't seen on social media or read some of my posts, I've been finishing off my own book, The Redeemer, and I'm currently trying to find it the right home. I was first runner up in the DHH Literary Agency's New Voices Award. I have also been proofreading fiction and increasing my writing/editing workload. I'm hoping to catch up on a few more of my 'must reads' over the festive season. I also need to catch up on reviews, as there are several that I still need to write up.Anyway, here are my top reads of the year (I haven't counted them but I know there are a lot more than 10 - oops!).Changeling by Matt WesolowskiThis first one is cheating a little as I actually read it at the end of 2018, but it wasn't published in paperback until 2019 so I saved it for this year's Book Love post. And I certainly can't leave it out!'...gripping writing, authentic dialogue, heart-pounding tension and a final twist that I seriously didn't see coming! Yes, as you may have guessed, I loved Changeling.'Read my full review here.The Courier by Kjell Ola DahlIt's not often that crime novels prompt me to do more research, and this book certainly took me on a journey of discovery.

It's a dark, intense and well-plotted exploration of identity, childhood abduction, memories and a mother's love.'Read my full review here.Turbulent Wake by Paul HardistyThe writing in this is stunning and the book is compelling, educating me as well as entertaining me.'I could read this book forever and it's likely to become one of my all-time Orenda favourites.'Read my full review here.My Absolute Darling by Gabriel TallentFor me, it's often all about the writing - and this book's prose is beautiful.'This is a touch, challenging read - brutal, unsettling, raw and shocking yet also filled with vivid beauty and hope ...

I had to force myself to slow down.'Read my full review here.The Lost Ones by Anita FrankI haven't yet written a review of The Lost Ones - it's on my list. This book swept me away to spooky 1917 England and wowed me!I tweeted: 'A haunting, emotional, ghostly & tragic mystery filled with family secrets.'Nothing Important Happened Today by Will CarverI used the word 'brilliant' a few times in my review...'The writing is staccato - quick, fast-paced and compelling - drawing the reader in. As a few things slotted into place, I realised the book was so clever too - like nothing I've ever read before. The underlying premise is unique and ... yep... brilliant.'Read my full review here.Six books that are out next year:Three Hours by Rosamund Lipton (9 January 2020)This book ... it's incredible.'Three Hours was a traumatic reading experience in many ways - it challenged me, thrilled me, stunned me and upset me - but I am so glad that I immersed myself within its pages.'Read my full review here.The Other People by C.J. Tudor (23 January 2020)No review written yet. But I tweeted: '...pretty much a one-sitting read. A twisty & compelling crime thriller with supernatural/horror undertones.'Haven't They Grown by Sophie Hannah (23 January 2020)No review written yet. But I tweeted: 'It's brilliant - very twisty and not what I expected at all!'My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell (31 March 2020)No review written yet. But I tweeted: 'Traumatic, dark, thought-provoking ... I had to put it down several times yet each time felt compelled to pick it up again.'These, and several other books I've read that aren't yet published, could well be in next year's list! For full transparency, I'm disclosing that I have been proofreading for Orenda Books this year, BUT I never recommend books if I don't truly love them. If you know me well, you'll know that I'm honest about the books I read and only tweet about, and review, the ones I have genuinely enjoyed. Any Orenda books featured in this list really did wow me for various reasons.In 2020, I'm looking forward to reading some more fantastic books and catching up on some of the books I didn't manage to get to this year. I'll be a book blog partner of Jewish Book Week 2020, so look out for some of those posts.Have a great Christmas and New Year!"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with M. W. Craven", "date": "Sunday 15 December 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome M. W. CRAVENto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSTerry Pratchett is the author I read most often (closely followed by Michael Connelly and Carl Hiaasen). Sam Vimes, the Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (in his legendry Discworld series), is creation of pure genius and I devour over and over again any book he’s in. Funny, sarcastic, not overly bright but tenacious, he’s the perfect literary cop.... FILMS/MOVIESThis really varies from day to day. My all time favourite film is Heat with Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer, and I do enjoy a good heist film (The Town is another favourite) but I’m equally happy with a Marvel blockbuster. If I’m going to invest a couple of hours of my life, I need it to be entertaining, that’s the only caveat I have. I also have a soft spot for The Sound of Music (much to Mrs C’s amusement) but please don’t tell anyone . . .... TV DRAMASAnything with strong writing and well developed characters. There are some amazing shows on at the minute and we really are spoilt for choice. My top five would be The West Wing, The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad and Northern Exposure. I’m currently watching, and loving, Watchmen.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThe killers in Dennis Lehane’s Darkness, Take My Hand and in Michael Connelly’s The Poet are two of my all time favourite serial killers. Genuinely frightening and that’s because they were developed by two of the best authors in the world. And a bit left field, but Carcer in Terry Pratchett’s Night Watch also gave me the chills, as when he’s cornered he just grins and makes you think he’s done nothing wrong. Pure evil.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Hieronymus ‘Harry’ Bosch, Michael Connelly’s LA-based detective, is the stand-out cop of my generation. He’s absolutely relentless, has a strong sense of right and wrong and, with ‘Everybody counts or nobody counts’, he has the best motto of all time.... MURDER WEAPONSI do like the T-bone steak scene in Law Abiding Citizen. Thought it was extremely clever and, albeit a tad gruesome. And the Discworld’s first-ever gun (or as they spell it, ‘gonne’) that Sam Vimes had to investigate in Men At Arms was particularly funny.    ... DEATH SCENESBoromir’s death in The Lord of the Rings hit me hard, as did Ned Stark’s in Game of Thrones (the book deaths rather than their film deaths). Terry McCaleb, a criminal profiler in Michael Connelly’s books had a great death. Very sad but incredibly well done. And if you want someone investigating your murder, then who else would you want but Harry Bosch? Also, in The Story of the Trapp Family Singers (the memoir The Sound of Music was based on) there are some very sad deaths after the family escape to America.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI tend not to use writing sites but have The Guardian permanently open. I’ll then use a variation of the ‘So what?’ technique we used in probation management meetings when we were stress testing ideas. When a headline, a byline, or even a sentence gets my attention, I’ll ask myself, ‘What if?’. When I have an answer to that I’ll ask ‘What if?’ it again. A few ‘what ifs’ and you can go from reading about the life of a celebrity chef to a murder victim coming back to life...  ... WRITING TIPSAccepting that your first draft won't be very good is half the battle. It’s not until you start editing that the novel takes shape, finds a voice and becomes a coherent piece of fiction. ... WRITING SNACKSFizzy sweets. Strong enough to make me wince and suck my cheeks in. And just in case Mrs C reads this, I suppose I’d better say I eat lots fruit, nuts and pulses as well .About MIKE CRAVENA brand new voice in British crime fiction, M. W.

Charming. Charismatic. Psychopath . . . He's currently serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of his daughter, Elizabeth. Her body was never found and Keaton was convicted largely on the testimony of Detective Sergeant Washington Poe.So when a young woman staggers into a remote police station with irrefutable evidence that she is Elizabeth Keaton, Poe finds himself on the wrong end of an investigation, one that could cost him much more than his career.Helped by the only person he trusts, the brilliant but socially awkward Tilly Bradshaw, Poe races to answer the only question that matters: how can someone be both dead and alive at the same time?And then Elizabeth goes missing again - and all paths of investigation lead back to Poe.Black Summer was published in paperback by Constable on 12 December 2019Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},
{"title": "Outside looking in - a 2019 Chanukah update", "date": "Tuesday 10 December 2019", "text": "It's that time of year again, when pre-Christmas celebrations fill up my social media feeds. This year, Chanukah starts on 22nd December and lasts for eight days, so it 'clashes' with Christmas Day (two years ago, it started on Christmas Eve). We won't have a Christmas tree, but we will have a lit menorah and other Chanukah goodies. I originally wrote this post two years ago. But it seems relevant to post it again - with yet another update.Christmas: Outside looking inAt this time of year I sometimes feel like a trespasser. A ghostly apparition peering through a smudged window into a tinsel-draped world I'm not really part of.On the outside looking in. Here, but not here.I watch the fervent build up and read frantic discussions on social media from the sidelines. Present buying. Christmas trees. Delicious festive treats. Large family meals. I don't join in, but that doesn't mean I don't understand your stress and excitement. I have my fair share during the year, with the weekly Jewish Sabbath and several Jewish festivals (with a strong focus on food!).I've never celebrated Christmas. During my childhood, December 25th was simply a family day with a large lunch, as there was little else to do. No Christmas tree. No presents. No Christmas pudding. We would still eat turkey though, along with home-made stuffing, brussels sprouts and minced pies. I remember Christmas crackers on the table and watching festive TV. After all, that's what everyone did at 'this time of year'.I knew all about Christmas, don't get me wrong. I had plenty of friends who celebrated it - non-Jewish ones and Jewish ones - and I didn't go to a Jewish school. I didn't take part in the annual Nativity play but would watch the rehearsals from the sidelines, learning the songs and the lines, just as I watch the build up to Christmas now. I didn't go to the school carol services either (we had a day off instead - shopping or cinema, if I remember right, though we were probably meant to do school work(!)). Yet I knew all of the carols anyway.I guess not much has changed.For me, this time of year has always been about Chanukah (Hanukkah), the Jewish festival of lights, which lasts for eight days. A festival of miracles and hope and joy. Unlike Christmas, Chanukah doesn't occur on a set date each year, as it's determined by the Hebrew calendar. One year, it may be in November, and the next year in December. This year it begins on 22nd December as soon as darkness falls.In keeping with tradition, each night we will light candles on a nine-branched Menorah (also called a Chanukiah), an extra candle each night (with the ninth candle called a Shamash (helper) to light the others).So one candle on the first night, two on the second and so on, until all eight candles are twinkling in a row. The candles symbolise a miracle in the second century BCE, when a handful of Jews defeated the Greeks to reclaim back their Holy Land and rededicated the Second Temple in Jerusalem. When they wanted to light the Temple's Menorah, there was only enough oil for one day - yet miraculously the oil lasted for eight days, known as the miracle of Chanukah.There's a whole Rugrats episode devoted to this!At Chanukah, it's traditional to eat fried foods - especially doughnuts (donuts) and latkes (fried potato pancakes like rosti) - and to play a game with a dreidel (a four-sided spinning top) for coins, nuts or chocolate.We can buy Chanukah biscuits (including candle or dreidel shaped ones).Chanukah is often associated with presents, but that's not a Jewish tradition so I assume it's down to the influence of Christmas over the generations. We give money called Chanukah gelt (or chocolate coins) to children, as well as to charity. You can now buy Chanukah decorations, as sparkly as the Christmas ones, and lots of crazy Chanukah-themed items.Even Chanukah socks last year (no, I didn't buy them).As a child, I would receive one Chanukah present each night (some small, some large), as did my two boys when they were younger. Now they are teenagers, the eight-present tradition has faded away in our house. But not the candle lighting - never that.Chanukah is also a time for community, with activities and celebrations at our synagogue. Last year we had our second interfaith event with the local church - our rabbi lit a large menorah as the vicar beside him switched on the Christmas tree lights. There were Jewish songs and carol singers, and mulled wine and minced pies and kosher donuts for the children. This year, it's a little different due to the timing, as the Christmas lights are already lit. But our synagogue is still doing a communal Chanukah lighting, encouraging people of all faiths to come along.Some people worry they'll offend me if they wish me Happy Christmas. But not at all. When I say I'm on the outside looking in, I don't mean this in a negative way. I enjoy watching friends building up to their big event of the year - my Twitter and Facebook feeds are filled with that positivity. After the last few years of world politics, the election this week (and Brexit (currently still) on the horizon), we all need plenty of that.People who know I'm writing fiction often ask me what I'm writing. I used to be suitably vague and didn't say much about what I'm doing or what stage I'm at. But last year, I was more open about the fact that I'm writing Jewish-themed crime fiction, set in a fictional multi-cultural town in Hertfordshire, UK. I'm very open about my Jewish heritage and proud of it too. My book happens to be set at this time of year - Chanukah and Christmas season.I finished my novel, The Redeemer, earlier this year. Here's the blurb:‘REPENT BEFORE YOU DIE … OR MAY YOU NEVER R.I.P.’Threatening plaques, vigilante killings, a Jewish community - what’s the link? The clock is ticking to the next murder.After journalist Shanna Regan witnesses an antisemitic incident in Hillsbury, a small Hertfordshire town, she uncovers a series of threatening fake commemorative plaques. Each plaque highlights someone’s misdemeanour rather than a good deed. Delving deeper, she realises these plaques are linked to vigilante killings spanning several decades, with ties to the local Jewish community. As her search for the truth becomes personal, she puts her own life in danger. Can she stop the next murder in time? I was first runner up (honourable mention) in the DHH Literary Agency New Voices Award at the end of September 2019, as announced at the Capital Crime festival's opening night party. I've had great feedback on my novel and I'm now looking for an agent - the right agent - or a publisher.I'm hoping that one day you'll get a chance to read my novel (if you want to!) and learn more about Jewish traditions, the worrying rise of anti-semitism in the UK (what it's like to experience it for real 'on the frontline', not what you read in the newspapers) and the huge sense of family and community spirit that I know so well.2019 has also been exciting on the work front. In January, I launched my own work website (finally). You can visit it here. I also started proofreading for publishers - including Orenda Books - and individual authors, and I added several magazines and websites to my health writing portfolio. I was one of Jewish Book Week 2019's official blog partners and hope to do the same in 2020.Thank you for reading to the end of this non-bookish post and for supporting Off-the-Shelf Books, which turns five on 30th December 2019. I'm very behind with reviews, but hope to catch up soon - it's been a particularly busy few months.I wish you all a Happy Christmas, Happy Chanukah or whatever you're celebrating within the next few weeks. And a Happy New Year too."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Syd Moore", "date": "Thursday 28 November 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome SYD MOOREto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSSo tough to boil it down to one author, but I guess it would have to be Wilkie Collins. I remember being a bookseller, i.e. skint, when Penguin brought out their cheapo classics to compete with Wordsworth Editions. The Moonstone and The Woman in White, which at that point I’d heard people mention but had never read, became instantly affordable. The next pay day I bought them, consumed them during my lunchtimes and was pretty instantly hooked. It was the beginning of a life-long love affair with classic crime.  ... FILMS/MOVIESThe Love Witch by Anna Biller. This film is a sumptuous visual feast with the aesthetic of a technicolour Hammer Horror. Anna Biller, the director, also designed the costumes and they are to die for.  Celebrating  kitsch in a serious way its take on women, witches and sexuality is really quite different. Elaine, the eponymous Love Witch, seduces men using love potions and beds them with fatal consequences. The film is feminist, funny, clever and explores the ‘female gaze’. What’s not to love?... TV DRAMASI am a big fan of Scandi Noir and really enjoyed the Swedish series, Jordskott. Though it has many of the components of the crime/thriller genre – a vanished child, an angst-ridden detective and a community hiding a dark secret – there is more than a touch of the Brothers Grimm about it. I do like my crime drama with a sprinkle of the supernatural and this one blends both genres wonderfully. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSIs it too obvious to say Vilanelle? She was such a triumph of characterization, the epitome of style, cunning, sardonic humour and grace. Obviously there was that little psychopathy thang going on, but it didn’t prevent me, and most of the UK population, rooting for her throughout Killing Eve.  A third series can’t come too soon. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES It’s got to be Saga Noren from The Bridge. Totally atypical of your usual TV detective, Saga is more complex, more logical and more vulnerable too. The writers handled her Asperger syndrome and the development of her character expertly throughout the entire series so that the final episodewas almost televisual perfection.   I’d love to see her back on our screens again, but at the same I wouldn’t want to jeopardise the legacy of what was, in my opinion, one of the best television dramas to grace our scenes in decades. Some things should be left alone.  ... MURDER WEAPONSThe spoon used in The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon.    ... DEATH SCENESThis is more a scene of death than a death scene and comes from Hercule Poirot’s Christmas. The epigraph that precedes the story gives you a hint of what’sto come ‘Yet who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?’ (Macbeth).Simeon Lee, a wealthy git, instructs his four sons to return home for Christmas with the intention of cutting their allowances and changing his will. It’s no surprise then that he doesn’t make it through to Boxing Day. In fact on Christmas Eve the family hear a terrible scream from Simeon’s room. Breaking down the door they are greeted with the most shocking and awful sight. Furniture has been overturned, crockery smashed. Simeon lies dead, his throat slashed from ear to ear, in a great pool of blood. Of course, Christie’s description brings the horror home to the reader. I was a teenager when I came across this and the scene left a very strong impression.    ... BLOGS/WEBSITESOne of the websites that I come back to time and time again is www.witchtrials.co.ukIt’s a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the Essex Witch Trials and has been put together by one brilliant and clearly noble man, Steve Hulford, who set it up ‘so that the poor victims are not forgotten’. His fantastic site lists the trials in year order and in order of village. It also records the accused women and men by name alphabetically so is very user-friendly. In addition to all this information you will find transcripts of contemporaneous pamphlets, essays on different aspects of the witch trials, details of the Witchcraft Acts, videos and recommended reading. Well worth checking out.  ... WRITING TIPS1.    Plan2.    Persist3.    Finish... WRITING SNACKSIf I’m going well, I will treat myself to a cup of tea and a slice of cake from the local baker’s at about 3pm.About SYD MOORESyd Moore is the author of the Essex Witch Museum Mysteries (Strange Magic, Strange Sight, Strange Fascination) featuring Rosie Strange, and two previous mystery books, The Drowning Pool and Witch Hunt.For nine years prior to writing Syd was a lecturer, worked extensively in the publishing industry and presented Channel 4’s book programme, Pulp.  She was the founding editor of Level 4, an arts and culture magazine, and co-creator of Superstrumps, the game that reclaims female stereotypes and the founder of The Essex Girls Liberation Front.

{"title": "Journeying back to the Holocaust - Day 3", "date": "Thursday 21 November 2019", "text": "If you've read my previous posts, you'll know that earlier this week I took part in a two-night, three-day journey to Lodz and Krakow, along with around 40 other people, including three rabbis. The trip was run by J-Roots, a Jewish organisation that creates a unique learning experience - and this was certainly traumatic, thought-provoking, humbling and unforgettable.For Day One, click here.For Day Two, click here.When I read these two posts, I feel that my emotions don't necessarily come across as much as I would have liked them to. And I'm sure that in another week, I'll have plenty more to add.I've always put off going to Poland. It was something I felt I 'should' do but the time was never right. So why now? That's an interesting question...My eldest teen visited Poland two years ago with his school, the younger one is due to go at the end of January. These trips are part of their sixth form schooling, and it made me wonder why I had put it off for so long. And I realise the biggest reason was 'fear'.I've grown up hearing Holocaust stories, speaking to survivors, seeing the tattooed numbers on their arms. The Holocaust is part of my Jewish heritage, though I wish it wasn't. I wish it never needed to be. I wish it had never occurred. This week, I've seen first-hand the sheer brutality of the Nazis, the scale of the pure evil that lurked the landscape, the loss of humanity and identity, the ripping apart of Jewish communities and families, the fact that this was all legalised.At a time when antisemitism is rising yet again all over the world, this is when we all need to come together, to remember, to educate, to share and to never forget. And I felt that to do that properly, I needed to see it for myself.This was the right time for me.As many of you who read Off-the-Shelf Books will know, I am writing Jewish-themed crime fiction. In September, I was first runner up in the DHH Literary Agency New Voices Award for my first three chapters of The Redeemer. I'm now trying to find an agent - the right agent - for my book. The Redeemer isn't about the Holocaust, though it does feature within the plot, but it IS about modern antisemitism, beginning with an antisemitic incident in a park based on real experiences.I'm now going to give you an account of Day Three, which was all about Auschwitz-Birkenau.If any factual background is incorrect, I apologise in advance as I'm writing this quickly. I took notes and photos during my visit and I'm using those in order. I also apologise for any typos! Some of the descriptions will be graphic (even more so, in later posts), but I'm not apologising.Auschwitz 1We began with Auschwitz 1. I'm not going to go into details of the background - Mr Google can help you there. But Auschwitz 1 is a tourist site, with coffee shops and bookstores, DVDs and postcards on sale. This feels wrong (particularly the postcards). Yet this infrastructure enables people to come and visit for a day, to be educated about what went on here and leave with a book or a DVD that may help them to learn more, to educate not just themselves but others too, particularly the future generations.If you do visit, read up on Auschwitz first. Read the Jewish accounts, read the survivor stories. Don't rely on your Polish guide to tell you everything that happened there - they may not even mention the word 'Jew' very much. Going with J-Roots was a unique experience. We not only heard individual stories of brutality and survival (each one filled with emotion) as we walked around, but we were WITH a survivor, Mala Tribich (see previous posts). Eventually there will be a time when there are no survivors remaining, so it is the duty of the next generation, and the next, and so on, to keep these stories among us, which is why I am sharing them here. These stories are horrific but I'm not going to apologise as they need to be heard.It's free to visit Auschwitz  but not, ironically, to go to the loo there - that costs 2 zloties each time. We heard the story of a survivor who visited Auschwitz with J-Roots. When they reached the toilets, he pulled up his sleeve, showed his tattoo and spoke to the woman taking the money at the till. She laughed and let him through.What did he say to her?'I have lifetime membership.'There are no words...As we stood at Auschwitz, we could feel the chill through our layers of clothing (including thick coats, hats, scarves and gloves), even though it wasn't a particularly cold day. Imagine standing for roll call for up to 19 hours at a time, in just flimsy pyjamas (or even naked if that's what the guards ordered you to do), whatever the weather, unable to move. If 1000 prisoners were counted out to work in the morning, 1000 had to be counted back in - the dead were carried among them as they walked back through the gates, as there would be punishment at roll call if the numbers were inconsistent.The hospital blocks were called 'waiting rooms for the crematoria', used as places for medical experimentation with very few treatments available.Block 27 is all about names (I briefly mentioned this in my Day 2 post), set up by Yad Vashem (The World Holocaust Remembrance Centre). When we talk about the Holocaust, we talk about six million Jews. But these aren't six million Jews as a collective, these are six million individuals. Each one had a name, a face, a family, a life, before the horrors began.Inside Block 27, there are pages and pages of printed names, currently around 4.5 million names, so nearly 2 million left to go. Each Holocaust victim has been given back their identity - and they are remembered.As mentioned in my Day 1 post, I didn't have any immediate family in Europe at the time. They were all in England already. Some of my family names (such as Levy) are very common but two - Motzner and Sumeray - are more unusual (ironically, one of the people on this trip is a distant cousin of mine - her family used the name Motzney). I checked out the list of names and found both Motzners (Motzni) and Sumeray (Sumeraj/Sumraj in Polish) listed there. I will never know if they were relatives, but it's possible that some of them were.One block contains the belongings of the Jewish prisoners. We weren't permitted to take photos of the hair that was taken from women murdered in the gas chambers and was used by the German textile industry - you can see the hair woven on a loom. The hair was mainly curly, now faded and greying. I can't even describe the quantity of hair behind the glass cabinet frontage. But I felt physically sick as we walked slowly through the room.There was a cabinet of the Jewish prayer shawls (tallit), which are indicative of life as a Jew, symbolic at all stages of life and even at death.Then there were the crutches and prosthetic limbs, the glasses (spectacles), the suitcases the families used to carry their possessions (labelled as if going on a family holiday) - all taken away when they arrived at the camp. The shoes, all shapes and sizes, even sandals, many still retaining their colours.If you have read any of my tweets or Instagram posts, you'll have seen details of a kosher kitchen. People who keep strictly kosher will eat and prepare dairy meals and meat meals separately - so no cheese on bolognese or in a burger. You also don't eat milk after a meat meal (instead, waiting a few hours), so no Dairy Milk chocolate after your roast chicken. Meat includes poultry. We use separate cutlery, crockery, pots & pans, utensils, chopping boards etc for milk and meat. Then there are parev foods (neither milk or meat), such as all fruit and veg, egg and fish. To make kitchens easier to manage, we try to colour-code the items. Meat items are traditionally red, dairy items are blue and parev items are green, yellow or neutral.So why am I telling you this?When Jewish families are told to pack for deportation, what do they take? If they want to eat, they need to pack up their kitchen. See the pots and pans below and look at the colours...THIS is how Jewish families pack.We entered a gas chamber and saw the ovens used to dispose of the bodies. These ovens have been reconstructed with original parts. In the larger room - the gas chamber - there are holes in the ceiling where the gas pellets were thrown down.On Tuesday 19th November 2019, we took this journey into this gas chamber and crematorium, the same journey that 1.2 million Jews were forced to take. They never came out alive. We walked in free ... and walked out free, physically untouched, still breathing ...BirkenauBirkenau has a very different feel to the other Auschwitz site. There are no coffee shops or bookshops, no cabinet displays and no renovation work. This was the largest death camp in the world - the largest cemetery in the world - and I can't even describe its size. You could spend several days wandering around this camp and still not see it all.Inside, the men's barracks are on the right, women's barracks on the left, separated by the train track and barbed wire.There was a stillness in the air.I barely spoke during my time there.I had no words.This is the men's quarantine hut of the camp, with latrines at the end.Thousands of men, sitting back to back to each other, being told they have just two minutes 'to go'. Each one propping up the man beside them and behind them, willing them not to die. This would be after several days spent in a cattle truck with no sanitation, diarrhoea and dysentry rife among the prisoners. Shut your eyes and just imagine ... compare this with our modern sterile lives.A group of Jews were told to clean out the latrines with their hats. When they left the quarantine hut, they were told to put their hats back on their heads. Not one of those Jews survived Auschwitz.If a woman was pregnant in Birkenau, this was a death sentence. Google the story of Gisella Perl, a Jewish gynaecologist deported to Auschwitz. She saved the lives of thousands of Jewish pregnant women, but in order to save the mothers she had to suffocate their newborns - 'a life for a life'. If she hadn't, both the mother and baby would have been murdered. After the war, she opened up a practice in New York. Many of her clients were women from Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, women she had saved, women who wanted her to deliver their new baby, born into freedom - this time saving their baby's life, not taking it. Read the phrase 'a life for a life' - and try not to cry.Here are the bunks where the men slept (top bunk, middle bunk, lower bunk), crowded together, no sanitation, covered in fleas and lice and with rats around their feet. As mentioned, diarrhoea and dysentery were rife within the camp. Which would you choose - top, middle or bottom?Standing by the cattle truck, where it was decided who lived and who died, we heard the story of two parents arguing over who was going to hold the baby once they were separated to go left or right. The SS officer took the baby from the mother's arms, ripped the baby apart and then handed half back to the mother and half back to the father. Sorry to share this story - it makes me feel sick and tearful too - but these stories need to be shared.We touched the barbed wire, thinking of what it means to be free.Finally, as daylight faded, we reached the back of Auschwitz and stood by the ruins of the crematorium and said prayers and read poems.And then we walked back out again - free.This is the end of Day 3 and the end of the Poland trip. But this life experience won't stop there. It has changed me in a way I can't describe. This has been an emotional rollercoaster and has put life in perspective, especially as a Jew growing up in the UK.When I arrived home from Stansted airport at 12.30 am, I peered into the bedroom of my youngest teenager. He was fast asleep. I stood there watching him for a while, thinking how fortunate my husband and I are - that our great grandparents were already here.I've shared my words. I've shared my thoughts. Yet there's still so much more I can say. We have been 'warned' that our emotions will continue to play havoc with our minds over the coming days, weeks and even months.We must remember.We must pass on the stories - the horrific stories - to our children and grandchildren.We must never forget."},

Some of the descriptions will be graphic (even more so, in later posts), but I'm not apologising.Mala's storyWe were particularly honoured to travel with Mala Tribich MBE, a Holocaust survivor. Straight after breakfast (an early start), we heard Mala's story.She was born in Piotrków Trybunalski in Poland in 1930. Piotrków was a thriving town with a significant Jewish population. It was the first town in Poland to have a ghetto - in 1939 - a prototype of what was to come. The ghetto was overcrowded with a lack of sanitation.After 2.5 years, there were rumours of deportation, except of people of working age. Mala's parents and aunt and uncle were introduced to a man who said he would hide two Jewish children - Mala (11) and her cousin Idzia (10). In hiding, the girls missed their parents but it wasn't safe for them to return. Eventually though, Idzia told the family they were staying with that she could go and stay with good friends of her parents. She was taken away and never seen again.Mala returned to the ghetto, where everyone lived in constant fear. Her mother and sister were rounded up one day and murdered in the local forest. Mala had the responsibility of looking after her 5-year-old cousin, Ann, whose mother was deported to a concentration camp. She was separated from her father and brother and was sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp with Ann.When they arrived, everything was taken away from them. They had to queue up to give their details, undress, get their heads shaved, have cold showers and were given a striped jacket and skirt. They couldn't recognise each other - they had been stripped of their personality and identity.At this point, Mala mentioned how important it is to give everyone who was murdered during the Holocaust a name - to give them their identity back (more on this on Day 3).Their daily food rations were half a slice of bread, a bowl of liquid the guards called soup, another grey-brown liquid (the guards called it coffee) and occasionally a small knob of butter or margarine. Enough to keep someone on the cusp of life.From there, Mala was transported in a cattle truck to Bergen-Belsen where conditions were appalling. She said the first thing that hit her was the smell and smog. People were skeletons, shuffling around aimlessly. Sometimes someone would be shuffling along then suddenly collapse and die in front of her eyes - there were dead bodies everywhere. At the age of 14, she and her cousin were taken into the children's barracks, along with children of diamond workers from Amsterdam. She contracted typhus and was very ill when the camp was liberated. When the British forces liberated the camp, Mala was drifting in and out of consciousness and saw people running - she couldn't understand how any of her fellow prisoners had the strength to run. The only other member of her close family to survive was her brother, Ben Helfgott - former Olympic weightlifter for Britain.As I mentioned in my post about Day One, Mala is an amazing woman. She doesn't look her age and has the energy of a 30 year old, walking faster than most other people in our group. She was an inspiration to all of us on this trip.Lodz cemeteryAfter Mala's talk, we checked out of the hotel and went by coach to Lodz cemetery. This showed the financial and spiritual wealth of the Lodz Jewish community before the war.We were shown the cemetery hall where bodies are prepared for burial. Preparation before burial is a very important aspect of Judaism but during the Holocaust this was denied - a basic Jewish and human right.We saw the Ghetto Field, where people risked their lives to bury the dead from Lodz Ghetto. The plaque says it all: 'The Ghetto Field' - holds the graves of 43,527 Ghetto victims during the years 1940 to 1944. Many victims were executed or brutally slain; others died from disease or starvation.Yes, you read that right - over 43 thousand people were murdered in just four years, in just one place.We heard the story of two brothers (10 and 8) who dragged their father's dead body all the way from the ghetto to the cemetery. They buried him with their own hands, digging the soil - two young boys who should have been playing and having fun, burying their own father. And then between them, they dragged over a large boulder to mark the grave so that they could identify the burial site after the war.Near the entrance of the cemetery, there are six large holes. After the liquidation of the ghetto, Jews were left there to clear up. They were ordered to dig six large pits and then they were locked in a building, but the Nazis fled as the Russian army was approaching and left them there. These Jews all survived and the pits remained empty.PiotrkówWe visited key sites in Mala's life. Her first home and then her home in the ghetto.The Nazis didn't only want to destroy the Jews, they wanted to destroy Judaism. And the first way to do that is to destroy the synagogues, then the books, then art ... then everything else.We visited the Great Synagogue in Piotrków, which was devastated by the Nazis during the war. After the war, it was rebuilt and used as a library and it is now being renovated to become a museum. We said prayers there, again bringing Judaism back into the building.Again, look at the bullet holes:At this point, I want to mention my thoughts about Poland. These small towns were empty. We stood in the main square in the middle of day and it was fairly deserted, like a ghost town. Many buildings were derelict too. There were hardly any cars on the roads. Every time we passed, or drove through, a forest, we wondered how many Jews had been shot in there, how many mass graves are still waiting to be discovered.WolbromWe tried to visit three mass graves here, but couldn't get to them as trees had fallen down and it was blocked off. But here's the experience I had that evening - in the dark. Click here for a link to the actual memorial.We walked by candlelight, our feet squelching into the wet leaves and mud underfoot, barely able to see in front of us. We walked in silence in either single file or in pairs. It was pouring with rain, so many candles didn't last the journey. I imagined how it must have felt all those years go, making that same journey, knowing you were walking to your death.We stopped in a small clearing, among thin tree trunks, glowing silver in the candlelight, dark silhouettes of trees in the background rising about us. All was silent. I shut my eyes and imagined it as it would have been as we said prayers for the dead.Jews were given a number. They were made to strip naked and lie down in a particular area in a giant pit, on or among bodies of men, women, children and babies, some still hanging on to life. And then the shots rang out. One soldier is pictured sitting on the side, dangling his legs, holding his gun, smoking a cigarette, laughing at the dead (or nearly dead) beneath his feet.Krakow - The Jewish Heroes SquareNearly every town square will have a history involving the rounding up of Jews, often the murdering of Jews as well.In this square, there are 33 memorial chairs of iron and bronze in memory of the Jews murdered in the Krakow ghetto.One of the buildings on this square used to be a children's hospital. When the Nazis came, they went in shooting.But that still wasn't enough...They threw the babies from the nursery on the top floor out of the windows down to the streets below.And still that wasn't enough...They played a game - how many babies could they catch on their gun. There are photographs of soldiers holding their guns with two or three babies stuck on top.Schindler's FactoryLastly, we visited Schindler's Factory. It was late in the evening so the museum was closed, but we stood outside the gates and we remembered...We watched Schindler's List during our journeys on Day 2. If you haven't watched it, please do - as it gives a fairly accurate representation of the Holocaust. It's chilling and shocking.Oskar Schindler was a member of the Nazi party with a factory in Krakow. He is believed to have saved 1200 Jews (some pictured above). Though it's not just 1200 Jews. When we talk about the 6 million Jews who died, we don't just mean 6 million. Each of those 6 million should have lived to have children and grandchildren and so on ...And that's the end of Day Two. For Day three, click here."},
{"title": "Journeying back to the Holocaust - Day 1", "date": "Wednesday 20 November 2019", "text": "If you could go on the trip of a lifetime, where would you go? Probably not to the forests of Poland, searching for mass graves, or to Auschwitz, to see tiny shoes of children who were murdered by the Nazis. But that's exactly what I was doing earlier this week.I took part in a two-night, three-day journey to Lodz and Krakow, along with around 40 other people, including three Rabbis. The trip was run by J-Roots, a Jewish organisation that creates a unique learning experience - and this was certainly traumatic, thought-provoking, humbling and unforgettable.All of my great grandparents came to England in the early 20th century and, in fact, one of them was even born here. So I had no close relatives in Europe when the Nazis invaded. Yet being Jewish, and growing up with stories of Holocaust survivors, listening to their first-hand accounts, meant that the Holocaust always felt personal. In another dimension, it could have been MY great grandparents and grandparents there, which meant my parents and I would never have been born.We were particularly honoured to travel with a Holocaust survivor. Mala Tribich MBE is 89 years old. She was born in Piotrków Trybunalski in Poland. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Mala and her family fled eastwards. When they returned, they had to move into the ghetto that was established in her hometown, the first in Poland. Her mother and eight-year-old sister were murdered in the local forest. When the ghetto was liquidated, Mala became a slave labourer at the age of 12. She was separated from her father and brother and was sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp with her 5-year-old cousin, Ann. From there, she was transported in a cattle truck to Bergen-Belsen where conditions were appalling. She contracted typhus and was very ill when the camp was liberated. The only other member of her close family to survive was her brother, Ben Helfgott.Mala is an amazing woman. She doesn't look her age and has the energy of a 30 year old, walking faster than most other people in our group. She was an inspiration to all of us on this trip.I'm now going to give you an account of Day One.If any factual background is incorrect, I apologise in advance as I'm writing this quickly. I took notes and photos during my visit and I'm using those in order. I also apologise for any typos! Some of the descriptions will be graphic (even more so, in later posts), but I'm not apologising.DabieWe left Stansted airport early on Sunday morning and arrived at Lodz airport.The first place we visited was a village called Dabie near Chelmno. Dabie used to be a hive of Jewish life with around 1000 Jews living there. We searched for hidden clues to the Jews who once called Dabie their home, before they were rounded up and sent to their deaths.We were shown an apartment block. Its windows have an archway at the top - usually a sign of a synagogue (Polish buildings usually have rectangular windows). We were led inside and up narrow stairs into the dark attic, with the torch apps on our phones lighting our way as we stumbled over badly-boarded flooring (with holes and dips in the middle) sprinkled with sawdust. In this tiny attic space, at the far end, we found this Hebrew writing on the wall. These words feature in our own synagogue in England. But these are faded, part of the wording missing, destroyed by bullets - you can see the damage clearly, including bullet holes close up. Something terrible happened here... We sang Jewish songs and clapped along, to bring back some Judaism into this former synagogue.ChelmnoOur next visit was to Chelmno. I found this to be one of the most difficult parts of the whole trip.Chelmno was the first death camp of the Nazi's Final Solution, which was operational in December 1941 before the Wannsee Conference. Gassings took place in experimental gas vans, claiming the lives of over 200,000 Jews.The Nazis would pump the exhaust back in the van as the Jews travelled towards the forest - the same journey we took on the coach. Once they arrived, the dead (or nearly dead) were dumped into open pits. The first victims of the massacre came from Dabie. Other Jews were transported to the forest and then shot there. 'One bullet, One Jew' - though occasionally 'One bullet, Two Jews' where a baby was held against its mother's chest. Locals helped to dig graves, serve vodka to the SS soldiers, find the Jews to round up... Local boys would take gold off the corpses - if they couldn't remove the rings, they would cut off the fingers instead. Then the bodies were burnt - cremated - and the bones smashed.We were there to find these bone fragments. It was daylight when we arrived and we walked around in a daze, searching in the grassy areas, shifting the mud and grass with our shoes or our fingers.These are bone fragments of the Jews who were murdered here. People have found teeth and even jawbones still remaining in the soil after all these decades. They look like bits of stone, but you realise they're not. We wandered mainly in silence, concentrating on the task, respecting those who were murdered in this place - just because they were born Jewish.We gathered all of the bones together and gave them the Jewish burial they deserved.We walked back to the main road in the darkness, highly emotional, again with just torches to light up our way. We - a group of 40+ Jews - were free to walk away when 200,000 Jews could not.Radegast stationThen we visited Radegast station - for yet another experience that I will never forget.Tens of thousands of Jews were transported from this station to death camps, including Auschwitz. It is now a memorial and museum. We were there after dark, so the museum was closed.Around fifty of us stood in a cattle cart in the dark.We nearly filled it, with its low ceiling, wooden walls with cattle rings and barbed wire on the windows. We kept the door open to give us a little light, but could just imagine being shut inside - not just with another 50 people, but with 200 people, maybe more. If there was space above the heads of the prisoners, babies would have been shoved inside on top of them. We were in there for maybe 15 minutes, but they would have been in there for days. Men, women, children, babies ... with no sanitation (maybe a bucket), no food or water. People dying around them, so hard to breathe, the stink...The photos below used flash so that you could see the details. But there was nothing to see in the darkness, just the faces of those around you. When I tried to take a photo of the room without flash, nothing showed up.Then finally we visited the memorial.And that ends Day One.For Day Two, click here.For Day Three, click here."},

Bridgestock", "date": "Wednesday 13 November 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome R.C. BRIDGESTOCKto share their BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSAgatha Christie is THE Queen of Crime Writers. I love her simplistic style that hides complex plotting. Her ability to build suspense throughout the neat little chapters, each one more exciting than the previous one is pure genius. Maybe she used the likes of an Anacapa chart to help track the impossible-seeming, totally un-guessable plots? It does make one wonder how her mind worked, because we know that all her storylines were pure fiction. Agatha Christie books are the kind that I like to read, by lamplight, before falling asleep.... FILMS/MOVIESOceans Eleven. George Clooney and Brad Pitt come up with a Las Vegas heist with a reward so grand that the risk may be an excruciating demise, and that’s for starters. It’s fast-paced, and there’s never a dull moment thanks to the cunningness Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, Casey Affleck and Elliott Gould. A movie for the thinker, this is one of the most fun, and funniest movies I’ve ever seen. Don't get lost in 'things highly improbable'. If you do, you've missed the point. Enjoy!... TV DRAMASHappy Valley. We were the consultants on the BAFTA winning series. Sally Wainwright’s brief from the BBC was 'Juliet Bravo, modern day'. The drama was based in Sowerby Bridge Police Station where I (Carol), spent 17 years as a civilian employee, and where Bob was stationed when he was head of CID in the Calder Valley. We suggested Happy Valley to Sally. It was the name given by the officers to the Calder Valley - it was a lovely place to work. It is well known for the place where creatives live, and you can feel the influence of the writers and artists who flocked to the valley around the 70s and 80s. From artisan shops and inspiring galleries to organic pavement cafés and charming picture houses, the valley is justifiably proud of its artistic identity. A short distance from its towns you will find pretty wooded valleys and picturesque heather moorland.... FICTIONAL KILLERSNurse Jackie Peyton (Edie Falco). In the American medical comedy-drama series, Nurse Jackie finds every day to be a high-wire act of juggling patents, doctors, fellow nurses and her own indiscretions. She’s a serial killer but she’s such a great character that I couldn’t help liking her, even though I obviously disapprove of her murderous ways...... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Jack Frost. The character of Jack Frost (played by David Jason) was based on a real detective at West Yorkshire Police - unbeknown to him, until he saw his likeness on screen. Jack Frost’s resemblance to Gerry Dickinson, a good friend and former colleague, is uncanny. ... MURDER WEAPONSFrom a senior investigator's point of view, any weapon that is easily identified! For instance, in our experience, a manmade medieval 'cosh' - once the weapon was found, it was easy to put the weapon in the hand, so to speak, of the killer.     ... DEATH SCENESBob suggested the death scene of Kirsten to Sally Wainwright for the BAFTA awarding winning BBC drama Happy Valley. An extract from episode 3: TOMMY puts his foot down and reverses over KIRSTEN. We don’t need to see it; we can see it off LEWIS’s face. We may hear the noise as well, which will be like so many watermelons getting crushed. LEWIS has to look away. He may even get squirted in blood.To see the full episode: http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scripts/happy-valley-ep3.pdfIf this didn’t make your stomach ‘flip’ nothing will...   ...

Mr. Google has never let me down yet! We use Rightmove for house-hunting.... WRITING TIPSPlan- the backstory is equally as exciting to create as writing the book. Finish- we know so many great writers who get so hung up on the first few chapters being perfect, that they have actually never finished a book! The first draft is called a first draft for a reason. Write a book you’d want to read....

Bridgestock is the name that husband and wife co-authors Robert (Bob) and Carol Bridgestock write under.

The book is being published in paperback by Orenda Books on Thursday 14th November - it's original, twisted, clever and shocking. And here’s my full review, in case you missed it the first time.Nothing Important Happened TodayBy Will CarverPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 14 September 2019; Paperback - 14 November 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionNine suicidesOne CultNo leaderNine people arrive one night on Chelsea Bridge. They’ve never met. But at the same time, they run, and leap to their deaths. Each of them received a letter in the post that morning, a pre-written suicide note, and a page containing only four words: Nothing important happened today.That is how they knew they had been chosen to become a part of The People Of Choice: A mysterious suicide cult whose members have no knowledge of one another.Thirty-two people on that train witness the event. Two of them will be next. By the morning, People Of Choice are appearing around the globe: a decapitation in Germany, a public shooting at a university in Bordeaux; in Illinois, a sports team stands around the centre circle of the football pitch and pulls the trigger of the gun pressed to the temple of the person on their right. It becomes a movement.My verdictNothing Important Happened Today... So hard to describe this book and discuss it with someone who hasn't read it, other than to say it's brilliant (apologies as I'm going to use this word a few times in this review).It's beautifully written. The writing is staccato - quick, fast-paced and compelling - drawing the reader in. As a few things slotted into place, I realised that the book was so clever too - like nothing I've ever read before. The underlying premise is unique and ... yep ... brilliant.The book is so well plotted, bringing everything together, weaving in historical references to cults and serial killers with the events in the present day. It provides a melancholy monologue on modern living, social media culture and the pace of society. The book focuses on a highly emotional topic, yet doesn't read that way - I can't give anything away, so it's really hard to explain! The descriptions are shocking and graphic in places and maybe slightly disturbing.Nothing Important Happened Today will intrigue you from the start and after a while you won't want to put it down. The ending is so good and so right and ... so brilliant. You won't forget this book after you've read it! And you'll just have to read it to find out why!OK. I think I've waffled on enough now.

(CHRIS) EWANto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSI think it’s hard to beat Michael Connelly. His books deliver brilliantly, year after year. How many writers create truly iconic series characters like Harry Bosch, Mickey Haller and Renee Ballard? How many deliver brilliant standalone thrillers, too? Not many, obviously, but Connelly does. The Poet and The Lincoln Lawyer are two of my all-time favourite reads.... FILMS/MOVIESI’m going to go with Panic Room starring Jodie Foster. It’s tight, lean and brilliantly structured. And hey, if you like Panic Room, I hope you’ll enjoy A Window Breaks.... TV DRAMASIt’s super-glossy and totally implausible, but I got totally swept up in season one of How to Get Away With Murder. I loved the flash forwards and flashback sequences, the clever dovetailing of the plot, the sneaky reveals. Total escapist fun. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHow do you look past Tom Ripley? He’s such a devilishly appealing character – showing us where the hint of darkness in us all might lead. Plus, he travels to some seriously appealing locations in Patricia Highsmith’s novels. The sequences set in Venice in The Talented Mr Ripley get me every time....

{"title": "A Deathly Silence by Jane Isaac - Extract", "date": "Tuesday 5 November 2019", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for A Deathly Silence by Jane Isaac. I love Jane's books - I'm only halfway through this one, so I'm not writing a full review just yet. But I can tell you that the writing is fantastic - descriptions of people and settings, as always. I'm also intrigued about where this story is heading and I have NO idea who the killer is! In the meantime, here's an extract for you to read. A Deathly Silence is being published by Legend Press on 15 October 2019.Here's the extract ...Chapter 1The peaked rooftop of Billings factory reached into an indigo sky, thick with the promise of rain. Rhys ran across the car park. ‘Come on, let’s try the door!’ Connor dragged his feet. It had been fun, sneaking around the deserted industrial estate, throwing stones at the windows; climbing through gaps in the hedging; using the old CCTV cameras for target practice. He wasn’t sure he wanted to venture inside though. ‘What if it’s got an alarm?’‘Don’t be stupid, these factories were emptied months ago. They won’t be alarmed now.’ Rhys tried the handle, but it stayed firm.A glance skyward. The May rain clouds were beckoning an early dusk, tainting the air a murky grey. ‘We should get back, I’m supposed to be in by nine.’Rhys disappeared down the channel between the factory wall and the metal fencing marking its perimeter. The sound of a boot kicking a door followed. ‘What’re you doing?’ Connor said, jogging across the tarmac to join him.‘What does it look like?’ He moved around the back, tried another door. The handle was loose. It rattled, pulled back slightly. Rhys glanced at Connor and tugged harder. The door juddered open. ‘Here we are.’ The onset of night was thicker inside. They stepped over the threshold, into a small corridor with double doors facing them. Rhys pushed at one of the doors and they slipped into a wide open room. Pools of light streamed in from high windows, highlighting the scuffs and oil stains littering the floor. Rhys grinned, held out his arms and turned 360 degrees. ‘Whoa!’‘It stinks,’ Connor said, grabbing his nose.‘That’s ’cos it’s been shut up.’ Rhys bent down, scooped up an empty glue can and tossed it up towards a window. It landed just beneath the glass, pinging off the ledge, and fell back at their feet. Connor nudged it with his toe, Rhys kicked it back. As they moved down the factory, passing the can to one another, Connor’s shoulders slackened. It wasn’t so bad inside. Not really.Rhys yanked at the door of a metal cupboard on the far wall. The hinges squealed like nails on a chalkboard as it opened. Inside, a couple of well-used brooms were stored beside a stained mop bucket. They exchanged an excited glance and wrestled the handles off the brushes. One arm held out for balance, they fought with the sticks, moving up and down the factory like musketeers until Connor lost his footing, stumbled and slipped against a row of oil drums, sending one of them crashing to the floor. The noise reverberated around the factory. As Connor pulled himself up, a line of oil trickled out of the drum, encircling a dirty needle on the floor behind. Spots of blood inside the attached syringe made his stomach turn. ‘We should go,’ he said. Rhys wasn’t listening. He hadn’t seen the syringe, was already halfway up the stairs in the corner, his trainers tap-tap-tapping against the metal lip of each step. A low hum started in Connor’s head. ‘Rhys!’ He checked over his shoulder and followed.The door at the top of the stairs opened into another large room. A full moon had parted the rain clouds, its light streaming through the window and casting a milky glow across clumps of desks the former occupier had left behind. Discarded chairs were scattered about haphazardly. Connor gripped his nose with his free hand. The stench was stronger up there. The hum in his head intensified. A faint scratching sounded. ‘What’s that?’ Rhys said.Another scratch. Behind them. They whisked around, spotted a baby rat crouched in the corner. Rhys inched forward, lifting the broom handle. Then drove it to the floor. The creature scuttled under a desk. He chased after it, thrust the handle beneath the desk. More scratches. He poked it in further, pulled back. Rushed to the other side, Connor on his tail. The rat ran out, squeaked. Rhys doubled back to follow it, colliding with Connor. The whole building seemed to shake as they tumbled to the floor. The hum in Connor’s head cut. ‘Idiot,’ Connor said. He pushed his friend aside, checked his limbs. The cords of the carpet were rough, unforgiving. When he lifted his hand, it was damp. It looked like blood. ‘Urgh!’ He wriggled back, turned. And froze.A pair of legs stuck out the side of a far desk. Denim jeans; the laces of yellow trainers hanging loose. He elbowed Rhys. Pointed. Rhys’s jaw dropped.They peered around the corner of the desk together. And came face to face with a woman propped up against the radiator. Rhys jumped, screamed. Slid back across the carpet.Connor stilled, his breaths halted, staring at her. She didn’t flinch. Slowly he edged towards her, pointing the tip of the broom handle, still in his hand.‘Don’t!’ Rhys hissed.Connor ignored him and tapped her foot. It wobbled from side to side. Glassy eyes stared through a mop of dark curls. For a second, they gawped at the corpse in front of them, paralysed in fear. Then Rhys scrabbled back and jumped to his feet. ‘We gotta get out of here.’ ***Fifteen minutes later, Rhys’s words rang out in Connor’s head as he arrived home. ‘We tell no one.’ They’d run from the factory, out of the industrial estate and kept running, until their lungs burned and their chests ached. Only when they reached the park at the back of Weston High Street did they slump to the floor, hidden in the shadows, pressing their backs against the wrought-iron fence. The conversation they had there whirled in Connor’s mind, like a song on permanent repeat. He’d wanted to call the police. Rhys refused. ‘Even if we don’t tell them who we are, they’ll trace our mobiles,’ he’d said. Rhys knew a lot about police work. His father was serving a sentence after stabbing a man in the leg during a pub fight; his sister was awaiting trial for supplying drugs. ‘We haven’t done anything wrong,’ Connor had countered.‘We shouldn’t have been there. We were trespassing. No, we go home. Clean up. Carry on as if nothing happened. Someone will find her soon enough.’ Connor’s throat had thickened as he’d walked home. In many ways, Rhys was right, he couldn’t afford a visit from the police either, his mother was still reeling after discovering he’d skipped the last day of school and spent it playing football in the local park. There was nothing they could do to help the woman. But the gruesome sight of her glassy eyes, all that blood, kept popping into his head, making him shiver. The living room door sat ajar, a line of amber light seeping in from the hallway. The babble of the television filtered through from the front room. A distant chuckle: his mother. She was watching one of those comedy panel shows she liked so much. He quietly kicked off his trainers, scooped them up. The chill of the quarry tiles seeped through his socks as he tiptoed across the floor. He reached the washer, cast another glance towards the hallway, ears on hyper alert while he peeled off his jeans, shrugged off his hoody and shoved them in the machine, followed by his trainers.Connor was used to washing; he’d lost count of the number of football kits he’d put through when his mum was working. The powder skittered about on top of the clothes. He heard music come from the front room. The show was finishing. He put the powder away, turned the dial, pressed the On switch. The machine did nothing. Connor swallowed, turned the dial back. It was chilly standing there in his pants and socks. He needed to go upstairs, before his mother caught him. But he’d wiped his bloody hands on his clothes, couldn’t leave them like this.Frantically, he turned the dial again. It clicked. Thank God. He crept past the front room and up the stairs. Connor was just closing his bedroom door when he heard the music stop and his mother pad into the kitchen.About A Deathly SilenceA Deathly SilenceBy Jane IsaacPublished by Leged Press (15 October 2019)Publisher's descriptionWhen the mutilated body of a police officer is found in a derelict factory, the Hamptonshire police force is shocked to the core.DCI Helen Lavery returns from injury leave and is immediately plunged into an investigation like no other.

{"title": "Violet by SJI Holliday - resharing my review!", "date": "Monday 4 November 2019", "text": "I loved Violet by SJI Holliday so much that I'm sharing my review again today. If you visit SJI Holliday's website blog here, you can see photos from 'Violet's journey'. The book is set on the Trans-Siberian Express. SJI Holliday took this journey herself in 2006 and, for 30 days in September to October this year, shared photos of locations that feature in her book.And here's my review:Violet By SJI HollidayPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 14 September 2019; Paperback - 14 November 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhen two strangers end up sharing a cabin on the Trans-Siberian Express, an intense friendship develops, one that can only have one ending … a nerve-shattering psychological thriller from bestselling author SJI HollidayCarrie's best friend has an accident and can no longer make the round-the-world trip they'd planned together, so Carrie decides to go it alone. Violet is also travelling alone, after splitting up with her boyfriend in Thailand. She is also desperate for a ticket on the Trans-Siberian Express, but there is nothing available.When the two women meet in a Beijing Hotel, Carrie makes the impulsive decision to invite Violet to take her best friend's place.Thrown together in a strange country, and the cramped cabin of the train, the women soon form a bond. But as the journey continues, through Mongolia and into Russia, things start to unravel – because one of these women is not who she claims to be…My verdictIf you follow my reviews, you'll know that I love SJI Holliday's books. Violet is set to be one of my favourite reads of this year.Violet was great fun to read - there's mystery, humour and intrigue on every page. The writing is beautiful and compelling. The plot is creepy, chilling and clever - and very dark and very twisted.It's what I often call a 'car crash book'. When you know something bad is going to happen but you have no idea what, and there's obviously nothing you can do to stop it. And then, BAM, it all hits you.I could tell that the author has first-hand experience of the Trans-Siberian Express journey, from all of the tiny descriptive details, and I suspect that the book was a highly personal one to write. Maybe not the best book to read when your 18-year-old son is interrailing around Europe, but fortunately my son came back safely in one piece - unlike some of the characters in this book!SJI Holliday has written two believable and deeply flawed unreliable narrators. I had no idea which one was to be trusted, if either of them. I read the book with bated breath - and wanted to applaud the author's brilliance at the end.I don't often 'compare' books as it's not something I'm very good at, and reading is such a subjective experience anyway. But immediately I thought of Liz Nugent's Skin Deep - both books featuring an in-depth analysis of a female psychopath.SJI Holliday is proving to be a master of psychological thrillers, with expert plotting and fabulous characterisation. Brilliant stuff! Follow the Blog Tour"},

EwanPublished by Pan (31 October 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from NetgalleyPublisher's descriptionIf your family was targeted in the middle of the night, what would you do?You are asleep. A noise wakes you.You stir, unsure why, and turn to your wife.Then you hear it.Glass. Crunching underfoot.Your worst fears are about to be realized.Someone is inside your home.Your choices are limited.You can run. Or stay and fight. What would you do?My verdictI was hooked from the outset. If it hadn't been for sleep and work, I would have read A Window Breaks in one sitting - instead, it took two sittings. My first sitting involved reading until 1.15 am. My second sitting involved ditching work for an hour after lunch (just as well I work for myself so my time is my own).The book is split into two parts. There's the present, as Tom and Rachel try to keep their 13-year-old daughter safe from the armed intruders. And then there's the past, following the story of their 16-year-old son, Michael, who was killed in a car crash nine months earlier. Events are cleverly revealed by going backwards in time, with snippets of what really happened that night and how Tom has struggled to come to terms with Michael's death.I read this book so quickly - I barely took a breath and could feel my heart pounding throughout. I had to force myself to slow down. I often worry with these fast-paced thrillers that everything will be unbelievable. But this all felt so real - from the characters to the setting and even the plot. It all seemed plausible too, nothing so outlandish that I sat there shaking my head. I could feel the tension, every moment of fear. I could picture it all. I felt as though I was there.This is likely to be one of my books of the year."},

And then you'll hear the screams...Still devastated after the loss of his wife, Tom Kennedy and his young son Jake move to the sleepy village of Featherbank, looking for a fresh start.But Featherbank has a dark past. Fifteen years ago a twisted serial killer abducted and murdered five young boys. Until he was finally caught, the killer was known as 'The Whisper Man'.Of course, an old crime need not trouble Tom and Jake as they try to settle in to their new home. Except that now another boy has gone missing. And then Jake begins acting strangely.He says he hears a whispering at his window...My verdictThe Whisper Man is atmospheric creepy crime fiction in a small town setting, mixing supernatural with a serial killer on the loose. This was a one-sitting read for me, gripping from the start and clever plotted with well-drawn characters. I enjoyed reading the story from the points of view of different characters, especially young Jake. The writing is great - emotive and highly visual. I could see everything as it happened, and felt it too. It takes a lot to freak me out, but the book was certainly unsettling in places.The Whisper Man is more than just another police procedural with a missing child at its heart. This is a book about father-son relationships, grief and loss, providing an emotional core that's not always found in crime novels.Recommended.First Monday CrimeFirst Monday Crime is on Monday 4th November at City University, London.The panellists are Alex North, Louise Candlish, Abir Mukherjee and Victoria Selman, kept in line by moderator Sophie Goodfellow.You can reserve your free ticket here."},

That something turns about to be a highly valuable meteorite. With euro signs lighting up the eyes of the locals, the unexpected treasure is temporarily placed in a neighbourhood museum, under the watchful eye of a priest named Joel.But Joel has a lot more on his mind than simply protecting the riches that have apparently rained down from heaven. His wife has just revealed that she is pregnant. Unfortunately Joel has strong reason to think the baby isn’t his. As Joel tries to fend off repeated and bungled attempts to steal the meteorite, he must also come to terms with his own situation, and discover who the father of the baby really is.My verdictLittle Siberia is great fun to read – and now my favourite Antti Tuomainen book. Who knew that a piece of rock could cause so much trouble? A valuable meteorite crashing through the roof of a car driven by a drunken driver. Dodgy Russian gangsters and other dubious characters trying to steal it. Chase scenes through snowdrifts and deserted museums, along frozen lakes and rocky terrain. The setting is as chilling as the plot, with its icy landscape and close-knit claustrophobic community.All of this has been packaged into a quirky crime novel. Yet this is far more than just your ‘ordinary’ museum heist, as all manner of local secrets drift out into the open during the book's rollercoaster journey. While crime is at the heart of Little Siberia, this is also very much a book about people and humanity with its scenes of contemplation, questioning faith and belief, right versus wrong and the meaning of life. There’s a veteran-turned-priest deep in a personal crisis, with a 'miraculous' pregnancy surrounded by the mystery of fatherhood.The book has been translated well by David Hackston, retaining the author's dark Finnish humour, cheeky charm and sharp dialogue and narrative.With Antti Tuomainen, you never know what’s coming next.

And each time, the book has offered a slightly different 'reading experience' focusing on the background of the characters' lives.Cage is a fairly short book, but there's so much packed within its pages: a journalist's search for the truth, political conspiracies, a teenage boy with an axe to grind, Agla's adjustment to life outside prison and Sonja's natural instinct to protect her son. All of these threads weave together to create a multilayered plot that culminates in a dramatic ending.This book provides a real game changer, focusing more on Agla than Sonja. It does what few books manage to do successfully - evolving a character so much that the reader's view of them changes drastically. The author also manages successfully to create a sense of fear, with rising tension and violence. The Icelandic has been well translated into English and provides a sharp sense of place. I would advise reading all three books in order to allow the characters to grow - and to grow on you.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Host Ali finally has the life she always wanted, a career she can be proud of and a wonderful family with her college boyfriend, now husband. But that night her best friend makes an accusation so shocking that nothing will ever be the same again.When Karen staggers in from the garden, bleeding and traumatised, she claims that she has been assaulted—by Ali’s husband, Mike. Ali must make a split-second decision: who should she believe? Her horrified husband, or her best friend? With Mike offering a very different version of events, Ali knows one of them is lying—but which? And why?When the ensuing chaos forces her to re-examine the golden era the group shared at university, Ali realises there are darker memories too. Memories that have lain dormant for decades. Memories someone would kill to protect.My verdictHow well do you remember your student days? Are there some things you'd prefer to forget?What You Did is a psychological thriller following six adults who were friends at university. Twenty years on, they have met up for a reunion, their lives having taken various different paths over the years. Following an evening of heavy drinking, Karen accuses Ali's husband, Mike, of rape - and Ali's seemingly perfect life falls apart, torn between believing her husband and believing her best friend.The story is well-structured, told through different perspectives, and flits easily between past and present. None of the characters were particularly likeable but they certainly felt believable - these were real people living real lives - and none of them were reliable either, each one having a distorted view of the past and trying to keep secrets hidden.What You Did is dark and compelling, with an unsolved murder at the heart of it, revealing how our own memories can deceive us and how we often deceive ourselves. This whodunnit is a twisty read - one that should appeal to psychological thriller fans who love books featuring moral dilemmas and 'what would I do?' scenarios.First Monday CrimeFirst Monday Crime is back after its summer break on Monday 7th October at City University, London.The panellists are Nicci French, Peter Robinson and Marnie Riches, kept in line by moderator Claire McGowan.You can reserve your free ticket here."},

Andy Martin spent a year in the company of Lee Child, creator of tough-guy hero Jack Reacher. With Child is the diary of their adventures, tracking the publication and reception of Make Me, the writing of Night School at an apartment in Manhattan, the filming of Never Go Back in New Orleans, all the agony and ecstasy of the creative process and the sheer hard work of selling a bestseller. They go on the road together, from TV studios to bookstores, from Harvard to Stockholm, amid literary conferences and gunshows, rivalries and reviews ranging from adulatory to murderous. We meet fellow writers like Stephen King and David Lagercrantz and Karin Slaughter, and dissect the latest novel from Jonathan Franzen. But Martin also reaches out to Child's legion of readers in America and around the world. He tracks down a woman in Texas whose name appears in the home invasion scene in Make Me; he goes up a mountain in Montana in search of the only reader who thinks Reacher is a \"lightweight\"; and he talks to obsessive fans from Europe to South Africa who find salvation or consolation in the colossal form of Jack Reacher. This compelling account of life on the road with Lee Child demonstrates that readers are just as important as writers in the making of modern fiction.With Child: Lee Child and the Readers of Jack Reacher was published by Polity Press on 6 September 2019Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},

They’ve never met. But at the same time, they run, and leap to their deaths. Each of them received a letter in the post that morning, a pre-written suicide note, and a page containing only four words: Nothing important happened today.That is how they knew they had been chosen to become a part of The People Of Choice: A mysterious suicide cult whose members have no knowledge of one another.Thirty-two people on that train witness the event. Two of them will be next. By the morning, People Of Choice are appearing around the globe: a decapitation in Germany, a public shooting at a university in Bordeaux; in Illinois, a sports team stands around the centre circle of the football pitch and pulls the trigger of the gun pressed to the temple of the person on their right. It becomes a movement.My verdictNothing Important Happened Today... So hard to describe this book and discuss it with someone who hasn't read it, other than to say it's brilliant (apologies as I'm going to use this word a few times in this review).It's beautifully written. The writing is staccato - quick, fast-paced and compelling - drawing the reader in. As a few things slotted into place, I realised that the book was so clever too - like nothing I've ever read before. The underlying premise is unique and ... yep ... brilliant.The book is so well plotted, bringing everything together, weaving in historical references to cults and serial killers with the events in the present day. It provides a melancholy monologue on modern living, social media culture and the pace of society. The book focuses on a highly emotional topic, yet doesn't read that way - I can't give anything away, so it's really hard to explain! The descriptions are shocking and graphic in places and maybe slightly disturbing.Nothing Important Happened Today will intrigue you from the start and after a while you won't want to put it down. The ending is so good and so right and ... so brilliant. You won't forget this book after you've read it! And you'll just have to read it to find out why!OK. I think I've waffled on enough now.

AUTHORSStephen King. I’m one of what he calls his 'Constant Readers'. Between the horror, the fantasy, the science fiction and more recently crime thrillers, he really can’t be missed. His Mr. Mercedes series was excellent, and Joyland, was a return to old style ‘Hard Case Crime’ novels. ... FILMS/MOVIESJust one?! So hard - there are so many movies I love, across many categories. I have recently been educating my eldest in classic horror: revisiting Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St and Silence of the Lambs! But of more recent movies Split encapsulates for me what I love in a good movie: great characterisation of a complex murderer. ... TV DRAMASThere’s a lot of good dramas around at the moment, and I tend to rewatch my favourites when I am doing housework or cooking. Elementary is one of them, and I was gutted to find Netflix has taken it off! So no more reruns for me for a while (I am sending them daily request to return it!). I love Johnny Miller’s version of Sherlock Holmes: it’s contemporary and he gives him so much depth. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSJohn Wick. I know he is more revenge and retaliation killing, but I love the sort of aloof, don’t-give-a-damn attitude as he shoots up everywhere and everyone, while giving us a glimpse into the whole the underbelly of organised crime and contract killing he is embroiled in.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Whenever anyone mentions fiction detectives I always think of Poirot, in particular David Suchet’s version. Having recently read Agatha Christie’s autobiography I was surprised to find that she had never planned for him to be in more than one book, or popular, and initially didn’t like writing him. ... MURDER WEAPONSUmbrella. One of my characters used one in Mostly Dark. Scissors are another one good one. My characters have to use whatever is at hand.     ... DEATH SCENESI’m an avid watcher of Game of Thrones, and the series offers a plethora of choice for death scenes. But my favourite is definitely when Viserys Targaryen, Daenerys’s brother, dies. Khal Drogo gives him the crown he is demanding, in molten gold over his head! It’s marvellous! The one thing about Game of Thrones is how satisfying it is to watch the characters you hate die.    ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI don’t have specific sites I go to, it depends what I am looking for; when researching for Sleep I found myself on prison or government sites. For writing, I use www.thesaurus.com for synonyms a lot, when I am trying to find a word to describe something better or differently. ...

Or can you? Meet the Bensons. They're an ordinary couple. They wash their car, mow their lawn and pass the time of day with their neighbours. And they have a beautiful little girl called Daisy.There's just one problem. SHE'S NOT THEIRS.D. S. Nathan Cody is about to face his darkest and most terrifying case yet . . .My verdictDon't Make A Sound hooked me in immediately.It's my first Nathan Cody book - and certainly won't be my last - and I read it very easily as a standalone. From its chilling first chapter right through to the final page, this was pretty much a one-sitting read for me - a 'just one more chapter' book.Don't Make A Sound is very much a character-led novel - a mixture of psychological thriller and police procedural. It's fast paced and twisty, and felt very believable - what's going on behind closed doors? It's cleverly plotted, with a dark and disturbing storyline, as well as well written - several scenes had me holding my breath.For months, I've seen people on social media raving about the brilliance of this book - and now I can understand why!"},
{"title": "Blood Song by Johana Gustawsson", "date": "Thursday 29 August 2019", "text": "Blood SongBy Johana Gustawsson Translated by David WarrinerPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - out now; Paperback - 19 September 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionSpain, 1938: The country is wracked by civil war, and as Valencia falls to Franco’s brutal dictatorship, Republican Therese witnesses the murders of her family. Captured and sent to the notorious Las Ventas women’s prison, Therese gives birth to a daughter who is forcibly taken from her.Falkenberg, Sweden, 2016: A wealthy family is found savagely murdered in their luxurious home. Discovering that her parents have been slaughtered, Aliénor Lindbergh, a new recruit to the UK’s Scotland Yard, rushes back to Sweden and finds her hometown rocked by the massacre.Profiler Emily Roy joins forces with Aliénor and soon finds herself on the trail of a monstrous and prolific killer. Little does she realise that this killer is about to change the life of her colleague, true-crime writer Alexis Castells. Joining forces once again, Roy and Castells’ investigation takes them from the Swedish fertility clinics of the present day back to the terror of Franco’s rule, and the horrifying events that took place in Spanish orphanages under its rule.My verdictYet again, Johana Gustawsson has astounded me with her fabulous ability to intertwine crimes of the past with crimes of the present, seamlessly weaving multiple threads together to create a well-plotted, intelligent thriller.Blood Song has been translated from French to English extremely well by David Warriner, not just showcasing the author's vivid prose but also her visceral writing. It focuses on a period of history I know little about - Franco's brutal dictatorship - and led me to Google to learn more. I love the use of multiple locations - London, Sweden and Spain - to enrich the story with culture and history.Johana Gustawson's books are more than just crime thrillers. Each one has been written from the heart. Blood Song, in particular, is filled with emotion - from the brutality of Franco's dictatorship and shocking conditions in 1930s Spanish prisons & orphanages to the heartache of families attending modern-day fertility clinics, alongside the savage murder of a wealthy family in Sweden. It's based on the author's own experiences and her family history, and this shines through in her writing - it's personal and raw.Blood Song is tragic and heartbreaking - a book of love, loss and hope and a book to make you cry and make you think. Yes, the crimes are dark, but the author manages to cover them with sensitivity and delve deeper into the 'why?' as well as the 'what?', 'how?' and 'who?'. Plus the crime element is fascinating and intriguing, right up to the big reveal - how are all of the threads linked together and why is it such a personal one for the team of investigators?Bring on the next Roy & Castells book!"},
{"title": "After She's Gone by Camilla Grebe", "date": "Wednesday 28 August 2019", "text": "After She's GoneBy Camilla GrebePublished by Zaffre (March 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionA case as cold as the season. A profiler who can't remember. A killer ready to strike again.Psychological profiler Hanne Lagerlind-Schön and her partner, investigator Peter Lindgren are invited to the small, sleepy industrial town of Ormberg to investigate a cold case: ten years earlier a five-year-old girl's remains were found in a cairn near the town.But when a recurring memory problem resurfaces, Hanne struggles to keep track of the case. She begins keeping a diary, noting down everything she is likely to forget to keep up appearances so she doesn't lose her job. When the body of a woman is found at the cairn and one of Hanne's shoes is found nearby covered in the victim's blood, can Hanne's diary hold the key to what happened? How does this new murder connect to their old one? How can you put together what happened when the pieces keep fading away?My verdictI really enjoy Nordic Noir and always welcome the opportunity to find a new author to add to my list.After She's Gone is highly chilling, not just in plot but also in setting. Set in a small Swedish town and depopulated highly forested area, the story focuses on a cold case, in which a young girl's remains were found but never identified. This discovery in the past is soon linked to crimes in the present.The plot is complex, though certainly not too complex to follow, and focuses on various contemporary issues (which I can't reveal as I don't want to give away any spoilers). As with all good Nordic Noir, the atmospheric setting and inclement weather are as essential to the plot as the characters themselves. I tried to read between the lines and solve the case myself.After She's Gone offers everything I look for in good crime fiction - an intelligent multi-layered plot, intriguing mystery, well-developed characters, realistic dialogue and good writing. I haven't read the first book in the series and, while I did have a few questions about the main character, this can easily be read as a standalone."},
{"title": "The Secretary by  Renée Knight ", "date": "Thursday 22 August 2019", "text": "The Secretary By Renée KnightPublished by Doubleday (February 2019)Publisher's descriptionLook around you. Who holds the most power in the room? Is it the one who speaks loudest, who looks the part, who has the most money, who commands the most respect?Or perhaps it’s someone like Christine Butcher: a meek, overlooked figure, who silently bears witness as information is shared and secrets are whispered. Someone who quietly, perhaps even unwittingly, gathers together knowledge of the people she’s there to serve – the ones who don’t notice her, the ones who consider themselves to be important.There’s a fine line between loyalty and obsession. And when someone like Christine Butcher is pushed to her limit, she might just become the most dangerous person in the room...My verdictThe Secretary is chilling and twisty. One of those psychological thrillers that really gets right under your skin.This is a story of the revenge, power and betrayal - and that it's often the quiet ones you have to watch. Christine, a seemingly mild-mannered secretary, is the 'star of the show' - she knows everything there is to know about her employer, including secrets that have been brushed under the carpet, and would do anything to protect the family name.The plot is realistic, in an everyday setting that mirrors current world affairs, with the destruction of essential documents in high-profile court cases. The drama escalates slowly, creeping up on the reader, and is clever, dark and compelling, with believable and often hateful characters.I struggle with a lot of psychological thrillers at the moment, but The Secretary had me hooked all the way through."},
{"title": "Ruin Beach by Kate Rhodes", "date": "Thursday 22 August 2019", "text": "Ruin BeachBy Kate RhodesPublished by Simon & Schuster (February 2019)Publisher's descriptionTHE ISLAND OF TRESCO HOLDS A DARK SECRET SOMEONE WILL KILL TO PROTECT.Ben Kitto is the Scilly Isles' Deputy Chief of Police, but as the island's lazy summer takes hold, he finds himself missing the excitement of the murder squad in London - until the body of a diver is discovered, anchored to the rocks of a nearby cave.At first it appears that the young woman's death was a tragic accident, but when evidence is found that suggests otherwise, the islanders close ranks. With even those closest to the victim refusing to talk, Ben questions whether more than one resident might have had reason to harm her . . .Everyone is a suspect. No one is safe.My verdictRuin Beach is yet another suspense-filled crime novel from Kate Rhodes, with a fabulous sense of place.I loved the first book in the series - Hell Bay - and couldn't wait to 'meet' Ben Kitto again. This is the perfect blend of mystery, history and thriller, set in a small isolated community. I loved all of the little  details - from the dangers of the diving, the wonders of shipwrecks and the beauty of the islands - providing the perfect background to murder.Every time I read a Kate Rhodes book, I have the same thought and go through the same reading experience. The author has poetic writing that's begging to be read out loud (I urge you to try it). Her descriptions of the Scilly Isles - landscape, fauna and flora - paint pictures in the mind.I highly recommend this series - and the author's other series too."},
{"title": "Violet by SJI Holliday", "date": "Monday 19 August 2019", "text": "Violet By SJI HollidayPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 14 September 2019; Paperback - 14 November 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhen two strangers end up sharing a cabin on the Trans-Siberian Express, an intense friendship develops, one that can only have one ending … a nerve-shattering psychological thriller from bestselling author SJI HollidayCarrie's best friend has an accident and can no longer make the round-the-world trip they'd planned together, so Carrie decides to go it alone. Violet is also travelling alone, after splitting up with her boyfriend in Thailand. She is also desperate for a ticket on the Trans-Siberian Express, but there is nothing available.When the two women meet in a Beijing Hotel, Carrie makes the impulsive decision to invite Violet to take her best friend's place.Thrown together in a strange country, and the cramped cabin of the train, the women soon form a bond. But as the journey continues, through Mongolia and into Russia, things start to unravel – because one of these women is not who she claims to be…My verdictIf you follow my reviews, you'll know that I love SJI Holliday's books. Violet is set to be one of my favourite reads of this year.Violet was great fun to read - there's mystery, humour and intrigue on every page. The writing is beautiful and compelling. The plot is creepy, chilling and clever - and very dark and very twisted.It's what I often call a 'car crash book'. When you know something bad is going to happen but you have no idea what, and there's obviously nothing you can do to stop it. And then, BAM, it all hits you.I could tell that the author has first-hand experience of the Trans-Siberian Express journey, from all of the tiny descriptive details, and I suspect that the book was a highly personal one to write. Maybe not the best book to read when your 18-year-old son is interrailing around Europe, but fortunately my son came back safely in one piece - unlike some of the characters in this book!SJI Holliday has written two believable and deeply flawed unreliable narrators. I had no idea which one was to be trusted, if either of them. I read the book with bated breath - and wanted to applaud the author's brilliance at the end.I don't often 'compare' books as it's not something I'm very good at, and reading is such a subjective experience anyway. But immediately I thought of Liz Nugent's Skin Deep - both books featuring an in-depth analysis of a female psychopath.SJI Holliday is proving to be a master of psychological thrillers, with expert plotting and fabulous characterisation. Brilliant stuff! Breaking DadBy James LubbockPublished by Mirror Books (April 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionThink you've got a dysfunctional family?Meet mine.For 18 years, my family lived a normal life in a respectable suburb…Until one day, my dad gave up his successful career, and unexpectedly became Britain's most wanted crystal meth dealer.This is our story. At times shocking, often unbelievable, and all 100% true.My verdictBreaking Dad is about a very unconventional - and dysfunctional - family. It reads like a work of fiction - but the story is true.James Lubbock's father switched from being a quiet and successful businessman to being a crystal meth dealer, addicted to drugs and leading a bohemian lifestyle. So James had to become the 'sensible' one, trying to keep his dad's behaviour in check.I first heard about the book in the Jewish Chronicle newspaper and was intrigued to learn more, especially as the family originally lived close to where I grew up, not far from where I live now. Most of the book is set elsewhere, but I still had a strong sense of understanding the family background - especially the Jewish references - and why the events would have been so out of character.Breaking Dad is filled with humour and honesty. It's fun to follow, yet there's also a sense of sadness when you read between the lines. It made me laugh, cry and somewhere in-between. James Lubbock isn't afraid to share his feelings about events of the past. The book is written as if he's chatting to a friend in a pub - no holds barred.I wished there had been longer to 'chat' as I would have loved a few more details in some places. But obviously there's a limit to what you can fit in a book. So obviously I did the next best thing, which involved Googling more... And that's always a sign that a book has been a fascinating read."},

AUTHORSWilliam McIllvanney. Willie began Tartan Noir with his Laidlaw Trilogy. Suddenly here were our voices, our locations, our thoughts about the social fabric of Scotland in the voices of the people who walked the streets of Glasgow. The greats who followed, like Ian Rankin and Val McDermid pay tribute to the man who began it all. Willie’s trilogy is to my mind, and many others, one of the finest things in modern (crime) fiction, and definitely in the Chandler and Simenon class.... FILMS/MOVIESIt has to be To Kill a Mockingbird. A coming of age story, a mystery, a crime, a trial, a social commentary. It has everything and all told through the innocent eyes of a child. And even better, that child is a girl.... TV DRAMASSons of Anarchy… Hamlet on a Harley Davidson. Can watch this multiple times. In fact it so influenced me, I wrote Sins of the Dead starring HD female riders and also bought a Harley. I also loved Line of Duty. As a writer of forensic novels, it’s so easy to spot the glaring errors, but the characters were fabulous.... FICTIONAL KILLERSAt the moment it’s definitely Villanelle, played by Jodie Comer in Killing Eve. She kills with abandon and yet, you like her! And you don’t want her caught. An obvious psychopath with no empathy, yet she catches us out all the time, when she pretends to have some. (Like in the latest season when she befriends a young badly burned boy in hospital…I won’t mention how that ends.)... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I was a big reader of P.D. James as a teenager and a definite fan of Adam Dalgliesh. On screen I loved Cagney and Lacey. It was way ahead of it time, and in my opinion still to be beaten. A wonderful example of how the chemistry of female duos work, which inspired the relationship between Rhona and Chrissy in the Rhona MacLeod novels. After that it has to be Jack Laidlaw, philosopher and detective.... MURDER WEAPONSI liked arsenic in an alcopop bottle, so I featured it in Blood Red Roses where I killed the bride-to-be on her hen night.    ... DEATH SCENESThe small push at the top of the Edinburgh Crags when a husband murdered his wife after looking round to check no one was about. However four folk looking through Camera Obscura on the Royal Mile saw it happen!  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESDepends on the book. As my protagonist moves round Scotland, I like to research the area thoroughly on line plus spend time there. The current book is set on the Isle of Skye, so everything I needed to know about Skye, using the Mountain Rescue Team, Climbing and walking sites, the Skye and Lochaber Police Twitter Feed! ... WRITING TIPSKeep the secret as long as possible, regardless of its size. That’s what keeps people turning the pages. And remember, it’s all about character. Readers stay with a series because they want to be with the characters.About LIN ANDERSONLin Anderson is a Scottish novelist and screenwriter best known for her bestselling series featuring forensic scientist Dr Rhona MacLeod of which there are currently fourteen novels, four of which have been long listed for the Scottish Crime Book of the Year, with Follow the Dead being a 2018 finalist. Lin is co-founder of the international crime writing festival Bloody Scotland which takes place annually in Stirling, Scotland, mid September. Find Lin Anderson on her website and on Twitter - @Lin_AndersonAbout TIME FOR THE DEADPublisher's descriptionWhen forensic scientist Rhona MacLeod returns to her roots on Scotland’s Isle of Skye, a chance encounter in the woods behind a nearby activities centre leads her to what seems to be a crime scene, but without a victim. Could this be linked to a group of army medics, who visited the centre while on leave from Afghanistan and can no longer be located on the island?Enlisting the help of local tracker dog Blaze, Rhona starts searching for a connection.As the island’s unforgiving conditions close in, Rhona must find out what really happened to the group in Afghanistan, as the consequences may be being played out in brutal killings on Skye . . .Time for the Dead was published by Macmillan on 8 August 2019Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Sleep by M K Boers", "date": "Tuesday 13 August 2019", "text": "SleepBy M K BoersPublished on 1 September 2019I received an Advance Reader CopyPublisher's descriptionA marriage made in heaven, a murder made in hell.Why kill the man you love?Lizzy was struggling, everyone knew that.He shouldn't have done those things.He shouldn't have pushed her so hard.And now, her children, her marriage, her hope - gone.It was all her fault, she knew that, but was there a chance of redemption?Lizzy Dyson’s on trial for her life. She knows she must pay for what she did, even if it wasn’t planned, but will the jury believe her?My verdictSleep is a compelling read - a character-led psychological thriller and courtroom drama.Lizzy is on trial for murder, spending most of her time locked in a cell, which means she has plenty of time to think about the past. And she certainly has plenty to think about it.By getting into Lizzy's thoughts and following her conversations with her friends, family and legal team, the tiny details of her marriage are gradually revealed, with secrets unravelled and heartache exposed. This is well-written domestic noir with great characterisation - as well as a believable insight into a woman's breakdown and the impact of miscarriage and stillbirth (and the need for support).This is one of those books where you think you know the story at the start, but your views and allegiance change as the book progresses. It made me want to shout and sigh and cry. I wanted to shake Lizzy at times to help her see the truth, to realise she wasn't the monster she thought she was and that she was much stronger (deep inside) that she had been led to believe.I really felt that I knew Lizzy by the end - her honesty, her grief, her remorse as she took herself on a journey of self-discovery, all she could really do to pass the time. I found myself turning the pages faster and faster, and felt bereft when there were no more. The ending of the book was perfect - satisfyingly so.Check out the Blog Tour in September"},
{"title": "The Night She Died by Jenny Blackhurst", "date": "Monday 12 August 2019", "text": "The Night She DiedBy Jenny BlackhurstPublished by Headline (November 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionOn her own wedding night, beautiful and complicated Evie White leaps off a cliff to her death. What drove her to commit this terrible act? It's left to her best friend and her husband to unravel the sinister mystery. Following a twisted trail of clues leading to Evie's darkest secrets, they begin to realize they never knew the real Evie at all...My verdictThe Night She Died is yet another dark psychological thriller from Jenny Blackhurst.It's the story of Evie and her best friend Rebecca - and what led Evie to jump off a cliff to her death on her own wedding night. It sounds like a straightforward suicide but, as expected, there's far more to the plot than that. The narrative is split mainly between Evie and Rebecca, opening up a complex and twisty plot of secrets, lies and betrayal.I had no idea which way this book was going - right through to the end. The book has been cleverly plotted and cleverly written to confuse as much as possible. As soon as I thought I had worked it out, the author threw something else into the mix, jumbling up my thoughts yet again. And made me question whether I even trusted any of the characters,I love Jenny Blackhurst's books and should have read The Night She Died sooner. It means I'm now a book behind, as Someone is Lying is out in ebook already - but it's on my shopping list (paperback out in November!)."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Louise Candlish (The Glass Bell Awards 2019 Shortlist spotlight) ", "date": "Wednesday 7 August 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome LOUISE CANDLISHto share her BEST OF CRIME ...Our House by Louise Candlish has been shortlisted for the 2019 Goldsboro Books Glass Bell Awards. The winner will be announced on Monday 16th September. THE GOLDSBORO BOOKS GLASS BELL AWARDSLaunched in 2017, the Goldsboro Books Glass Bell Award is awarded annually to an outstanding work of contemporary fiction, rewarding quality storytelling in any genre. The winner of the Glass Bell will receive £2,000 in prize money, and a handmade, engraved glass bell. The jury of ten consists of team members from Goldsboro Books, DHH Literary Agency and The Dome Press. There is no fee, or limit to the number of books that a publisher may submit, allowing both established and debut authors a chance to win. The inaugural winner was Chris Cleave, for his extraordinary Everyone Brave is Forgiven (Sceptre), the moving and unflinching novel about the profound effects that the Second World War had on ordinary citizens back at home in Britain. Last year, the award went to John Boyne for his sweeping, poignant and comedic odyssey of post-war Ireland, The Heart’s Invisible Furies (Transworld).... AUTHORSI tend to like crime fiction that isn’t too strict about the genre, like Kate Atkinson’s Jackson Brodie books. A sly, satirical edge is good for me. One of my all-time favourite thrillers is John Colapinto’s About the Author, which combines plagiarism and murder. Bliss.... FILMS/MOVIESOld movies win every time. I love a dangerously discontented housewife, preferably played by Barbara Stanwyck, and so I can’t not choose Double Indemnity (1944) by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler. I love the mood of doom, the clouds of cigarette smoke, the way you can’t help wanting the villains to get away with it.... TV DRAMASI like TV crime with a legal element and also a series that’s inventive in its storytelling. It’s hard now to remember when TV drama wasn’t nonlinear, but for me Damages – set in a legal firm helmed by Glenn Close’s ruthless patty Hewes – was a game changer for its brilliant use of flash-forwards.... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’m a sucker for a killer who doesn’t recognize or remember his crime(s), like the enigmatic Mike Engleby in Engleby, a square peg in the round hole of an Oxbridge college who gets caught up in a missing persons investigation. Sebastian Faulks isn’t known for crime fiction, but this is a psychological masterpiece.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Surely the most common answer, but Poirot has never been bettered, has he? The egg-shaped head, the eccentric use of English, the OCD habits. I love his sense of compassion, especially for the young and desperate. Death on the Nile was my first and favourite Poirot and I remember being very struck by his mercy, the way he allows the killer a way out.... MURDER WEAPONSSorry to be Agatha Christie-centric, but I have to choose the infected pus from a cat’s ear used in Murder is Easy. Urgh. I also have a soft spot for the scene in Serial Mom (by John Waters), when Kathleen Turner’s character bludgeons a neighbourhood enemy to death with a leg of lamb. Now that’s domestic noir.    ... DEATH SCENESThe one I find the most powerful is in The Talented Mr Ripley, when Tom Ripley beats Dickie Greenleaf to death with an oar. It’s such a stark, visual scene, just victim and killer in a little boat in the middle of an empty sunlit ocean. Horrific.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI admit to trawling Mailonline daily for ideas for new ways to torture my middle-class characters. ... WRITING TIPSWhen I was first asked to do a reading, I found I was editing the scene to make it more fluent, so I’m now a big believer in reading your WIP aloud. For dialogue in particular, it weeds out unnecessary words and unnatural phrasing.... WRITING SNACKSI’m keen on a mashup of snacks. I might mix together some walnuts and Maltesers and shards of Dime bar. As with reading, you don’t want the same texture and flavour with every mouthful.About LOUISE CANDLISHSunday Times bestselling author Louise Candlish was born in Hexham, Northumberland, and grew up in the Midlands town of Northampton.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Sherryl Clark", "date": "Monday 29 July 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome SHERRYL CLARKto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSI have a lot of favourites but currently it’s Tana French. I discovered her first book via  a review, and I love how each new novel takes a character from a previous one and they become the new main protagonist. They are all members of the Dublin Murder Squad, and the settings play a huge part, but mainly I enjoy the deep character development and great writing.... FILMS/MOVIESThere is a Bruce Willis movie hardly anybody has heard of – 16 Blocks – that I think is one of his best. I also use it a lot in classes to show structure. It works perfectly for this, whether you are looking at 3-act or even hero’s journey, but Willis portrays dilemma and redemption in such an understated, powerful way that it’s one of the few movies I can watch again and again.... TV DRAMASI can’t go past The Wire. It had me enthralled from start to finish, and there were so many multi-faceted characters doing good and bad at the same time! I had to pay attention in every episode and loved the way clues and hints were planted and then paid off later on. Such a great example of set up and pay off. But like my other ‘picks’ here, it was all about great characters as well as plot. I also loved Happy Valley and River.... FICTIONAL KILLERSSo many fictional serial killers blend together for me that it’s hard to name any I think are best. The one I remember most is in Silence of the Lamb s– not so much Hannibal Lecter but the other guy, Buffalo Bill, and the skinning and the moths. The visuals have stayed with me!... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Logan McRae in Stuart MacBride’s books set in Scotland. As well as having to put up with the constant rain in Aberdeen, McRae has the world’s most awful boss, DCI Roberta Steel. McRae is both dogged and determined, and sometimes hangdog, but underneath it all he’s clever and instinctive – just how we want our detectives!... MURDER WEAPONSPoisons interest me, although so far I haven’t used any in my novels. There is a certain poison dart frog that can kill humans. One variety apparently has a poison which has highly curative properties for humans, but the difference between what cures and what kills is so small that it’s too dangerous to use in medicine. In murder, however…    ... DEATH SCENESFor some reason I find the most horrific death scenes are to do with wood chippers or industrial mincing machines! Perhaps because what comes out is in no way human any more. The death scenes I remember most vividly are in the movie, Seven, I think because they all have a meaning that ties in with the killer and the motive. The head in the box at the end is both bizarre and horrible.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThe site I tend to use the most for research is Victoria Police. They also have free issues of their magazine, “Police Life”, which tell you all sorts of interesting things about latest developments and changes, as well as interviews with serving officers. For writing, I read Writer Unboxed and Steven Pressfield, among others. For in-depth research I have a growing collection of books, so I can have it all in one handy place, and I’ve recently completed a course on crime scene investigation and forensic pathology.... WRITING TIPSOne of the best tips I’ve ever had was actually about motivation generally – to team up with someone as accountability partners. You agree to your writing goals (words per day usually) and at the end of each day you email each other to “check in”. 28 days at a time seems to work best. Every time I’ve done this with a writing friend, I’ve written far more than I aimed for. It’s really productive. (I wrote about it here - https://medium.com/@sherrylclark/keep-your-writing-resolutions-commit-to-28-3a4749763335)... WRITING SNACKSMy writing go-to is coffee. I don’t drink a lot of it but often it’s coffee that gets my brain into writing mode for some reason. Even more so when I am stuck – I take myself off to a café and have coffee and write.

{"title": "Working in the Music Business - a guest post by Louise Voss", "date": "Thursday 25 July 2019", "text": "Today, I am delighted to welcome Louise Voss to Off-the-Shelf Books to talk about how working in the music business has influenced her novels. The Last Stage was published by Orenda Books on 11 July 2019.Working in the Music Business(and how it influenced my novels)By Louise VossI worked in the music business in the 90s, and it was such a profound experience that it has since featured in both my first and last novels.  The main characters in both To Be Someone and The Last Stage, Helena and Meredith respectively, were female popstars from successful 80s bands who subsequently had to come to terms with some of the less pleasant aspects of fame. I was originally planning to make the latter a sort of sequel to the former, a sort of ‘twenty years later’ story, since that’s almost the amount of time between publication dates, but as The Last Stage evolved, it became clear to me that the two women were very different, in both personality and appearance as well as their respective music tastes, so I made Meredith into a brand-new character instead. But the band threads remain in both novels, albeit very differing stories – The Last Stage is a crime novel, whereas To Be Someone was contemporary fiction. Unlike both Helena and Meredith, however, I was never a performer – perish the thought – but working with bands both big and small for years gave me a real insight into the joys and pitfalls of success, and how an act can go from being a bunch of kids messing around with guitars to selling out Wembley Stadium.It was 1992, I was in my early 20s and a music nut, going to as many gigs as I could while working in a London school of architecture as an administrator during the day.  It had literally never occurred to me that I could make a career doing what I loved; not until someone told me about an employment agency specialising in jobs in music, so - in those pre-internet days - I rang them up. They told me to write in. The only problem was, the agency was (and still is) called Handle Recruitment, and I addressed my letter to Handel, after the composer. Talk about overthinking! Fortunately they didn’t write me off as illiterate. I got my first industry job, PA to the International MD of Virgin Records, joining right after Richard Branson sold out to EMI for a billion dollars. Whilst I was disappointed that I’d missed out on his legendary parties, I was also relieved to escape the potential fate of many female employees: being lifted up round the waist by him and chucked into a nearby swimming pool…There were many other parties though, and the job immediately lived up to expectation. Record launches, leaving dos, album playbacks, aftershow bashes, awards ceremonies… The record business in the 90s was in my memory a strange mix of big business and quirky debauchery. Hospitality budgets were eye-wateringly huge. I remember the Christmas presents bought for some of the bigger artists – thousand-pound silk dressing-gowns from Harrods, expensive sound systems. Like they needed them! I used to think. People were mostly lovely, although with a few notable egos. One female exec had risen up through the ranks (helped in no small part by marrying her boss). Part of my job was organising the annual conference abroad for international executives, and once I dared query something she’d suggested. She shouted at me: ‘How DARE you question me! I’ve been running this company for twenty years!’ Not only did she not run the company, but she was 34 at the time…. A different boss I had at another record company famously got banned from British Airways for saying something so offensive to a stewardess that I still can’t repeat it without blushing. This was the company where the in-house drug dealer did regular Friday afternoon rounds of the office…so I won’t name that one! I loved working at Virgin. Not only did I make lots of friends I’m still in touch with, but I met my first husband there. Later in the 90s we relocated to New York to work for a Virgin subsidiary called Caroline Records. It was so interesting, going from working with huge bands at the top of their game, to brand-new starry-eyed acts whose first albums had just been signed. We promoted Ben Folds Five and the Chemical Brothers at the start of their careers, I also marketed Frank Sinatra’s grand-daughter’s band, and an act called The Del-Rubio Triplets, identical octogenarians in short skirts and cowboy hats…never a dull moment.  I took it all for granted, the business flights and freebies, seeing bands every night, the backstage passes for all the Virgin and EMI acts who came to town. I went to Bowie’s 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Gardens, Peter Gabriel’s flat in New York, had my photo taken with Blur, dinner with the Smashing Pumpkins and a hug from Lenny Kravitz. After we moved back to the UK, I became a director of Sandie Shaw’s company, which was another brilliant job – Sandie was great fun to work with. It’s only really now I look back that I think how extraordinary it all was, what an amazing experience to have. I’m not surprised it’s cropped up more than once in my books, and more than likely will again in some guise or another.            About Louise VossOver her eighteen-year writing career, Louise Voss has had eleven novels published – five solo and six co-written with Mark Edwards: a combination of psychological thrillers, police procedurals and contemporary fiction – and sold over 350,000 books.

Years later, strange things start to happen and it becomes clear that some know who she is…At the peak of her career as lead singer of a legendary 1980s indie band, Meredith Vincent was driven off the international stage by a horrific incident. Now living a quiet existence in a cottage on the grounds of an old stately home, she has put her past behind her and come to terms with her new life.When a body is found in the manicured gardens of her home, and a series of inexplicable and unsettling events begins to occur, it becomes clear that someone is watching, someone who knows who she is … Someone who wants vengeance.And this is only the beginning…My verdictThe Last Stage is a twisty psychological thriller - a tale of revenge, identity and disturbing pasts.Ex-singer Meredith Vincent has a 'past' she's been trying to hide, something that she's kept to herself for years while living a quiet life away from the crowds. But now her past is beginning to catch up with her - or rather, someone is trying to catch up with her and they're not looking for a sentimental reunion.The psychological thriller market is saturated, so it's always a bonus to find a book that offers more than the rest of the crowd. I raced through this one, with its cosy crime feel, twisty thriller plot and quaint British setting.The book is filled with an abundance of vibrant, memorable, larger-than-life characters, in the past and present, and I loved the descriptions of the old stately home, cottage garden and canal boats. I can imagine author Louise Voss having as much fun writing this book as I had reading it (despite the darkness behind it).The Last Stage contains a murder mystery to solve and secrets to reveal. There's even some history in there too. It's funny, smart and highly entertaining!"},

AUTHORSAlex Marwood. The Wicked Girls was an astonishing debut, and she continues to go from strength to strength. I’ve read an advance copy of her new novel The Poison Garden and I honestly think it’s her best yet. ... FILMS/MOVIESThe Talented Mr Ripley. Casting wholesome as apple pie Matt Damon as Highsmith’s sexually ambiguous, morally bankrupt antihero was a stroke of genius. It’s a beautiful film and Damon succeeds in making us root for Ripley even when he’s at his most diabolical. ... TV DRAMASHappy Valley. Everything about it is perfect - the writing, the direction, the performances. Sarah Lancashire can do no wrong in my book. And Sally Lindsay is superb. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSDexter Morgan. I love the Dexter novels and TV series. He’s such a morally complex character - a serial killer who derives sadistic pleasure from what he does but who also works as a crime scene investigator and only targets other killers. The relationship between Dexter and his detective sister Deb invites us to see another side to him - the little boy lost who grew up to be a cold, calculating killer.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Marnie Rome, heroine of Sarah Hilary’s brilliant series. Another deeply complex character with a compelling back story. And I love the interplay between Marnie and her gay, black sidekick Noah Jakes. They’re a great pairing - both outsiders with emotional baggage, both trying to make the world a better place.... MURDER WEAPONSI think there’s more horror in the  mundane - a blow to the head with a golf club or a tin of beans, an electric appliance tossed into the bathtub. There’s an episode of Columbo where a murder is committed with an electric food mixer. ... DEATH SCENEThe scene in Brian De Palma’s Carrie where Piper Laurie is killed with a variety of knives and a potato peeler and the gift of telekinesis. This scene doesn’t appear in Stephen King’s book. There Carrie kills her mother by making her heart stop. The film version is more spectacular and hugely satisfying. ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI spend a lot of time on social media. Facebook for more civilised discussions and Twitter for observing people at their worst. Some of the spats I witness on Twitter make me despair. And some inspire me to write! ... WRITING TIPSWhen you’re going through writing hell, keep going. It’s much easier to fix pages of bad writing than it is to turn a blank screen into perfect prose. Get the words down first. Fix them later. ... WRITING SNACKSI try to avoid snacks but I have been known to inhale family-size bags of dry roasted peanuts. About PAUL BURSTONPaul Burston is the author of five novels and the editor of two short story collections. His most recent novel, The Black Path, was a WHSmith bestseller. His first novel, Shameless, was shortlisted for the State of Britain Award. His third novel, Lovers & Losers was shortlisted for a Stonewall Award. His fourth, The Gay Divorcee, was optioned for television. He was a founding editor of Attitudemagazine and has written for many publications including Guardian, Independent, Time Out, The Times and Sunday Times. In March 2016, he was featured in the British Council’s #FiveFilms4Freedom Global List 2016, celebrating “33 visionary people who are promoting freedom, equality and LGBT rights around the world”.He is the founder and host of London’s award-winning LGBT+ literary salon Polari and founder and chair of The Polari First Book Prize for new writing and the newly announced Polari Prize.Find Paul Burston on his website and on Twitter - @PaulBurstonAbout THE CLOSER I GETPublisher's descriptionTom is a successful author, but he’s struggling to finish his novel. His main distraction is an online admirer, Evie, who simply won’t leave him alone.Evie is smart, well read and unstable; she lives with her father and her social-media friendships are not only her escape, but everything she has.When she’s hit with a restraining order, her world is turned upside down, and Tom is free to live his life again, to concentrate on writing.But things aren’t really adding up. For Tom is distracted but also addicted to his online relationships, and when they take a darker, more menacing turn, he feels powerless to change things. Because maybe he needs Evie more than he’s letting on.Read a snippet from my review:\"The Closer I Get by Paul Burston is a dark tale of obsession and a chilling reminder that while social media can be a brilliant and beneficial forum, it can also be highly dangerous ...

AUTHORSRichard Price. The brilliant characterization in his police novels is nothing short of infuriatingly good. Read Lush Life for the most vivid fictional portrayal of New York City possible.... FILMS/MOVIESA Few Good Men. I saw this military courtroom drama when I was a kid and liked it so much I recorded it onto a VHS tape (ah, remember those?) for frequent re-watching. Luckily, it’s a bit of a syndicated classic and pops up on TV regularly even still. ... TV DRAMASThe original Law & Order will always be my favorite, especially the first five or six seasons. The show took a formula—literally half the show is about cops and the other half about lawyers -and turned it into an art form. I also adored The Wire and Sons of Anarchy, for the quality of the writing. (It’s no surprise that Richard Price was a writer for The Wire!)... FICTIONAL KILLERSJohn Wick. The body count in this recent series of thriller films is probably the highest of anything I’ve ever seen on the screen. Wick is a retired hitman who’s forced back into the life after an act of violence against his dog. His is a story of vengeance, not cold-blooded murder, but I love the way he lives by his “code.” ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Sara Gran’s Claire DeWitt—the self-appointed “world’s greatest detective” - is a ray of cocaine-fueled light. I love the unique approach in that series, which blends a present-day mystery with an old “girl detective” comic book series. Claire has an unforgettable cynicism, and she sees through everything and everyone except herself.... MURDER WEAPONSI like my murder straightforward, for the most part—you won’t find any unusual murder weapons in my books (yet). I’m very intrigued by poisons though, especially the world of plant medicine and how it can quickly turn deadly…... DEATH SCENEThis isn’t from crime fiction, but I’m still not over the final sequence of Six Feet Under, in which the audience gets to see how each main character will die in the future. A beautiful and haunting way to end a show about the fact that everybody dies…... BLOGS/WEBSITESFor no-nonsense writing advice, I like to read Chuck Wendig’s blog, Terrible Minds. I tend to do research in a lot of different places (until someone invents crime-google.com, this is the only way) but I find myself collecting interesting tidbits from Vice.com articles a lot.... WRITING TIPSI always say the best piece of writing advice is just to write. Annoying, but true. Beyond that, here are two practical tips that have helped me a lot:1. Don’t worry about chapters when you’re drafting a novel. Just write the story, and figure out the chapters later. 2. If you’re stumped about something, be it a detail, a plot point, whatever: just type “TK” and move on. It’s an old proofreading shorthand for “to come,” meaning, to be written later and probably on deadline. But it’s handy because the letters TK don’t appear in that order in any English words, so a find-and-replace will easily help you find them all before you turn the piece in to your editor. If you write linearly (like I do), you might find it scary to leave a detail just hanging around unfinished like that—the horror!—but it’s actually quite liberating once you try it a few times. ... WRITING SNACKSI can’t stand getting gunk on my keyboard so I rarely eat while writing, but I am never without a drink - usually coffee, sometimes tea or whiskey.About KRISTEN LEPIONKAKristen Lepionka is the author of the Roxane Weary mystery series.

This one is from her brother, Andrew, whose evening was interrupted by an urgent visit from Addison, a hip young DJ and one-time fling, who turns up at his apartment scared and begging to use his phone. She leaves as quickly as she appeared, but now Andrew is worried – especially when Addison never makes it home and her friends and family demand to know where she is. As the police begin to suspect that something may have happened to her, and that Andrew is involved, Roxane tracks Addison’s digital footprint as she goes deeper and deeper into the events preceding her disappearance. Meanwhile, a cop is found dead on the opposite side of town, leading to a swirl of questions surrounding a dance club whose staff – which includes Addison – has suddenly gone AWOL. As Roxane struggles to distinguish the truth from the stories people tell about themselves online, it’s clear that the mystery of Addison’s whereabouts is just the beginning.The Stories You Tell was published by Faber & Faber on 16 July 2019.Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},

AUTHORSI’m currently racing through everything by George Pelecanos (after binge watching both series of the HBO show, The Deuce, which he co-writes) – the Nick Stefanos series and the DC Quartet are amazing. Most of his noir novels are set in Washington DC in the ‘70s and ‘80s. They’re fast, furious and leave you breathless turning pages so fast.... FILMS/MOVIESI watch a lot of Chinese cinema. Especially Chinese gangster and revenge movies. Last year Jia Zhangke’s Ash is the Purest White was about contemporary jianghu, or outlaw gangs; while (my favourite Chinese movie director) Jiang Wen released a 1930s Beijing-set revenge thriller called The Hidden Man. ... TV DRAMASI started watching Justified, based on Elmore Leonard's short story Fire in the Hole and I will not stop till I get to the end of all six series and 78 episodes.... FICTIONAL KILLERSDix Steele, from Dorothy B. Hughes’s 1947 noir In a Lonely Place. A troubled ex-WW2 airman who roams LA at night, falls for actress Laurel Gray and might just be a serial killer. Humphrey Bogart played Dix and Gloria Grahame was Laurel in the slightly toned down 1950 movie, which still looked great. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’m going to go with Detective Sean Duffy of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in the seven Duffy novels from Adrian McKinty. 1980s Northern Ireland is a tough beat – Duffy deserves his nightly pint of vodka gimlet and a little Tom Waits at the end of the day. ... MURDER WEAPONSI’m a noir guy – it’s the city that kills you … every time. ... DEATH SCENEThe opening of James Ellroy’s LA Confidential – LAPD detective turned mob enforcer Buzz Meeksis holed up in an abandoned auto court with $94K, 18b of high-grade heroin, a 10-gauge pump, a .38 special, a .45 automatic and a switchblade.

Did you know that, contrary to public belief, in the UK a life sentence does actually last for life? And that capital punishment in the UK was abolished for murder in 1965 but the Death Penalty was a legally defined punishment as late as 1998? Offering thought-provoking insights into the study of crime, this fascinating go to book is packed with facts and figures revealing the myths and realities of crime in contemporary Britain.My verdictThis book has been compiled by two criminologists, with input from 50 crime and policing experts across the UK. The aim is to strip away some of the common myths and misconceptions surrounding crime, punishment, prisons and technology. It's split into ten parts: Historical Context; Crime in Britain Today; International Comparisons; The Police; Prison Realities; Criminal Justice; Black Market Britain; Violent Britain; Victims; and Crime and Technology. It doesn't just provide the facts but also encourages questions. The first of the 50 facts, about crime statistics, stresses the importance of remaining sceptical and not to take statistics at face value. Each section focuses on one particular fact, and uses statistics and academic resources to discuss the truth behind it. I learned a lot from the book (too much to describe here), but to give some examples I read about the true definition of arson, the reporting of (and dealing with) hate crimes, length of life sentences, the average cost of a contract murder in the UK, consent to bodily harm and so much more. Did you know that judges in courts of England and Wales DON'T use gavels (despite what the TV crime series show us)? Did you know Harold Shipman was Britain's most prolific serial killer, but no one actually knows how many people he killed. Did you know the fake medicines trade is now the world's largest market for criminal traffickers? I could go on...This book packs a lot of facts within its 300+ pages - often surprising and even shocking. It's a fascinating resource and should appeal to budding criminologists, crime fiction/true crime fans and, of course, writers."},

AUTHORSToo many great authors around at the moment and crime fiction is really experiencing a boom of talent. For my top author of the moment, I'm going to say Sarah Pinborough. ... FILMS/MOVIESAnyone who knows me knows that I practically mainline Movies and TV – I even watch TV while I am writing. I have so many favourite thrillers: Taken, Murder by numbers, Copycat, Manhunter and so many more but if I had to pick one, and its one that I watch a couple of times every year because of its brilliant cast and acting its got to be Internal Affairs.... TV DRAMASOh dear, where to even start? There are so many amazing TV dramas these days. I do gravitate towards crime based shows anyway – some of my favourites include The Wire, Justified, Hannibal, The Shield, Southland, Deadwood ~ really far too many to even list but if I had to pick one, and again, I watch this entire series at least once a year because of its hard-hitting and gripping storylines, excellent characterisation and tragically complex relationships  – I pick Oz. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSThis is a pretty easy one for me, my life-long obsession with Batman started before I can actually remember. There is something horribly chilling about the unpredictability, hedonism and sadism of The Joker.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Following on from my previous answer, it’s most definitely Batman. I have several graphic novels that I have collected over the years. What I like most is how he plans for every eventuality, he always thinks five steps ahead of the person he is investigating and for that reason he always wins. I know its probably not considered classic crime but created in 1939 for DC (Detective Comics), he’s passed the test of time, With two television series, countless animation and TV spin offs.  He’s the only man for me. ... MURDER WEAPONSI imagine this has come up before but in the Tales of the Unexpected story, there's the woman who kills her husband with the frozen leg of lamb, cooks it and then serves it to the police officers, genius.... DEATH SCENEI have recently re-read Red Dragon and I did really enjoy the Dolarhyde passages, he was so completely messed up and the way he killed was awful but the backstory gave it a certain poetry. A truly sinister individual. Killing whole families and putting mirrors in their eyes so that he can watch himself transform into The Red Dragon.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThis is a tricky one – but I always look up houses and base my characters homes on ones I find on rightmove.co.uk....

{"title": "My Absolute Darling by Gabriel Tallent", "date": "Thursday 27 June 2019", "text": "My Absolute DarlingBy Gabriel TallentPublished by Fourth Estate (12 July 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionAt 14, Turtle Alveston knows the use of every gun on her wall. She knows how to snare a rabbit, sharpen a blade and splint a bone. She knows that her daddy loves her more than anything else in this world and he’ll do whatever it takes to keep her with him.But she doesn’t know why she feels so different from the other girls at school; why the line between love and pain can be so hard to see. Or why making a friend may be the bravest and most terrifying thing she has ever done.Sometimes the people you’re supposed to trust are the ones who do most harm. And what you’ve been taught to fear is the very thing that will save you …My verdictMy Absolute Darling traumatised me, resulting in very disturbed sleep. Not many books manage to do that. I'm not upset that I read it, as it was everything I expected it to be (though admittedly possibly worse), but this was the reason why I had put off reading it for so long.This is a tale of love and survival in a brutal world, a coming-of-age novel involving a teenage girl who has had to grow up too soon. Turtle Alveston has a difficult and unusual life and a warped view of the world around her. But she knows that her father loves her and would risk everything to keep her safe.This is a tough, challenging read - brutal, unsettling, raw and shocking yet also filled with vivid beauty and hope. The harshness is cushioned by plush descriptions of the Californian coastline and its fauna and flora. I wanted to turn away yet couldn't as the writing was too compelling, too addictive and too powerful.My Absolute Darling is a thought-provoking read about victims and survival - a personal struggle of nature versus nurture and right versus wrong. But it won't appeal to everyone. You'll need a strong constitution - be prepared to read about a tough subject (graphic in places) and have your emotions churned and then shredded."},
{"title": "Little Darlings by Melanie Golding", "date": "Tuesday 25 June 2019", "text": "Little DarlingsBy Melanie GoldingPublished by HQ (2 May 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionTHE TWINS ARE CRYING.THE TWINS ARE HUNGRY.LAUREN IS CRYING.LAUREN IS EXHAUSTED.Behind the hospital curtain, someone is waiting . . .After a traumatic birth, Lauren is alone on the maternity ward with her newborn twins. Her husband has gone home. The nurses are doing their rounds. She can’t stop thinking about every danger her babies now face. But all new mothers think like that. Don’t they?A terrifying encounter in the middle of the night leaves Lauren convinced someone or something is trying to steal her children. But with every step she takes to keep her babies safe, Lauren sinks deeper and deeper into paranoia and fear. From the stark loneliness of returning home after birth, to the confines of a psychiatric unit, Lauren’s desperation increases as no one will listen to her. But here’s the question: is she mad, or does she know something we don’t?My verdictLittle Darlings is a very disturbing read and one that sent shivers up and down my spine. That's partly because of the subject matter (the disappearance of twin boys - every mother's nightmare) but also the unsettling nature of the writing and the plot.Lauren is a typical new parent - exhausted and paranoid, worrying about her newborns at every moment and desperate for some sleep. She's convinced that someone is trying to steal her babies, after a bizarre, terrifying experience at the hospital, but no one will believe her. Is it really just a new mother's paranoia or is there something more sinister going on? When Lauren's babies go missing and are then found and returned to her, she's adamant that these aren't her boys at all. I certainly had no idea whether this was real or a fabrication of Lauren's fragile mind.Little Darlings combines crime, fairytales and the supernatural. It's a slowburner, with great writing, and tension that escalates as the plot moves forwards. It taps into every emotion and is both terrifying and heartbreaking. The ending is slightly ambiguous - not enough to leave me hanging, but certainly with enough mystery to make me wonder, question and think."},

AUTHORSWho could go past that god of Gothic literature, Edgar Allen Poe? Poe is variously credited with inventing: the psychological thriller/the detective genre/science fiction/the name of the Baltimore Ravens NFL team. For my money you can’t go past Poe’s poem, ‘The Raven’, which is an elegy of undying devotion to those lost. Poe is the reason I exiled my pining protagonist, Tikka, to Baltimore. ... FILMS/MOVIESAlfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca, based on the 1938 novel by Dame Daphne du Maurier, and starring Laurence Olivier as Maxim de Winter. Tense, suspenseful; it’s everything Hitchcock does best. Intriguingly, the film deviates from the book in a major way (spoiler alert) when Rebecca’s death is revealed to be an accident, rather than murder at the hands of her husband. At the time, the Hollywood Production Code required murderers to be punished and so the murder plot was, ahem, killed off.... TV DRAMASStranger Things. Don’t think Netflix’s blockbuster sci-fi/horror/supernatural series constitutes crime? You tell that to the Demogorgons who are abducting children and imprisoning them in the Upside Down. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSWe first meet Agnes Magnúsdóttir in northern Iceland in 1829, when she is condemned to death for her part in the brutal murder of two men. While she’s not entirely fictional (this true criminal is fictionalised in Hannah Kent’s brilliant debut novel, Burial Rites), she’s most certainly a killer, and for that she must die. Based on the last public execution in Iceland.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Ian Rankin’s Inspector Rebus. Rankin is the UK’s number-one selling crime writer for good reason, and his hard-drinking, deep-thinking maverick Inspector Rebus is a perennial favourite. Linguistically, a ‘rebus’ is an enigmatic puzzle – the perfect moniker for Rankin’s inscrutable detective.... MURDER WEAPONSFew are better than the Bard when it comes to murder weapons, but even Shakespeare outdoes himself in Titus Andronicus when he has the titular Titus bake his enemies into a pie before serving them up to their mother. Bon appétit.... DEATH SCENEIs it cheating to say my favourite death scene is a scene where there are no deaths? The all-important ‘disappearance scene’ in the iconic Aussie novel, Picnic at Hanging Rock, describes four Victorian-era schoolgirls vanishing into the sun-saturated scrub, their petticoats flouncing as they go. Accident? Murder? Suicide? Three of the four girls are never seen again, and the riddle of their disappearance is never solved.Joan Lindsay’s beguiling mystery is something of a national obsession in Australia, with many readers believing the story to be true. It was the starting point when I wrote my own unsolved mystery novel, and the vanishing Van Apfel sisters owe much to those missing girls at Hanging Rock. ... BLOGS/WEBSITESMy local indie bookshop introduced me to Story Grid which is a website, blog, book, podcast, in fact, it’s an entire bookish universe designed to guide a first time novelist through the process of writing their book.

That summer, the hottest on record, was when the Van Apfel sisters - Hannah, the beautiful Cordelia and Ruth - mysteriously disappeared during the school's Showstopper concert, held at the outdoor amphitheatre by the river.  Did they run away? Were they taken? While the search for the sisters unites the small community, the mystery of their disappearance has never been solved.Now, years later, Tikka has returned home and is beginning to make sense of that strange moment in time. The summer that shaped her. The girls that she never forgot.Brilliantly observed, spiky, sharp, funny and unexpectedly endearing, The Van Apfel Girls are Gone is part mystery, part coming-of-age story - with a dark shimmering unexplained absence at its heart.The Van Apfel Girls are Gone was published by Point Blank Books on 6 June 2019.Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},

AUTHORSConan Doyle. Because Holmes is just such a perfect creation. His plots are clever, convoluted – and sometimes, frankly just a little OTT. But the genius pairing of Holmes and Watson laid the groundwork for countless ‘tec and sidekick duos, and got me into crime fiction from a very early age.... FILMS/MOVIESSilence of the Lambs. There’s so much that’s excellent in this film – the structure, the nuances, the atmospheric lighting, the acting of Foster and Hopkins. Truly a classic.... TV DRAMASHappy Valley.  It’s no accident that so many ex-‘Job’ people have praised this series’ authentic feel – wonderful writing by Sally Wainright, faultless acting by Sarah Lancashire and the ensemble cast. Gritty, compulsive viewing.... FICTIONAL KILLERSArya Stark. What, I can’t adore Holmes and still be ultra-contemporary? The traumas she’s endured have made her an implacable adversary, relentless in her need to avenge so many deaths. As the series’ end approaches, I suspect her days are numbered. But I’m still hoping she gets to cross one final name off her list …... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’ve already had Holmes, so let’s go for Val McDermid’s Karen Pirie – down-to-earth, determinedly unglamorous. Insubordinate, determined, compassionate. The (still) largely male-dominated world of male ‘tecs definitely needs more Karens!... MURDER WEAPONSToaster, from Helen Fields’ Perfect Crime. And gentlemen, you really don’t want to know which part of the male victim’s anatomy gets inserted into it …... DEATH SCENEAlmost any of Stuart MacBride’s ingenious methods of dispatch would do here! But I’m going with the mass murder in the opening scene of Stephen King’s Mr Mercedes. Why? Because King takes time to introduce us to the victims, to make us start to like them … and then kills them off in the most brutal, most senseless yet sadly believable way. Murder victims shouldn’t be anonymous, they should leave an imprint on our minds. And that’s what happens here.... WRITING TIPSI love Twitter– where else can you get into conversation with so many people you know you’ll probably never come into contact with in real life? (Mind you, in some cases you might be quite grateful for that…) And for locations you really can’t visit but need to describe in detail, Google Earth is your friend.... WRITING TIPSHmm. Try not to stare at a blank page or screen for ages – if you’re really not getting anywhere, get up and get out for a walk if you can. It’s amazing what a change of location does for the mental processes, and it does help to halt the, er, spread of writers’ posterior. Also, having a shower often works too – there’s something about the feeling of being cocooned in warm water and quiet that seems to give my thoughts the jump-start they need....

{"title": "Wolves at the Door by Gunnar Staalesen", "date": "Tuesday 11 June 2019", "text": "Wolves at the DoorBy Gunnar StaalesenPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - out now; Paperback - 13 June 2019)I received an Advance Reader from the publisherPublisher's descriptionOne dark January night a car drives at high speed towards PI Varg Veum, and comes very close to killing him. Veum is certain this is no accident, following so soon after the deaths of two jailed men who were convicted for their participation in a case of child pornography and sexual assault … crimes that Veum himself once stood wrongly accused of committing.While the guilty men were apparently killed accidentally, Varg suspects that there is something more sinister at play … and that he’s on the death list of someone still at large.Fearing for his life, Veum begins to investigate the old case, interviewing the victims of abuse and delving deeper into the brutal crimes, with shocking results. The wolves are no longer in the dark … they are at his door. And they want vengeance.My verdictI loved Wolves at the Door - definitely my favourite Varg Veum book so far, despite the dark subject matter.Just as in the previous book (Big Sister), I was hooked into the story from the very first page and couldn't drag myself away. This one follows almost straight on from Big Sister, so it's probably wise to read that one if you haven't done so already.Yet again, Gunnar Staalasen has written classic crime fiction with a modern twist, concentrating on contemporary criminal activities and social issues within a complex multi-layered plot. The story is revealed slowly but surely through a gripping investigation. Private investigator Varg Veum is investigating what initially appear to be accidental deaths but are revealed to be linked together by child pornography and sexual assault charges. Veum was also arrested (wrongfully) at the time so fears that he could be next.The writing is highly evocative with vivid imagery - all of the little details of what people wear, eat and drink bring Norway to life. I particularly love the main character's voice, with Varg Veum's wit and irony surfacing through the sharp dialogue and narrative, often prompting me to laugh out loud. Despite the humour though, my emotions were pulled in all directions - fear, sadness, worry and despair - with my heart pounding in certain scenes towards the end.Yet another great outing for Norwegian private eye Varg Veum, and author Gunnar Staalesen.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME (ACTION THRILLERS) with James Swallow", "date": "Thursday 30 May 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome JAMES SWALLOWto share his BEST OF CRIME (ACTION THRILLERS) ...... AUTHORSThe big three are the ones who had the greatest influence on my own writing in the genre, the authors who set the benchmark. First and foremost, Robert Ludlum – best known these days for the Bourne franchise, but also the man behind great novels like The Osterman Weekend and The Holcroft Covenant; Tom Clancy, the father of the modern technothriller; and of course Ian Fleming, who crystalized the idea of the popular action-espionage thriller. ... FILMS/MOVIESI’m a lover of movies on a big scale – the bigger the blockbuster, the better! – but I also love lo-fi cult films and stuff at what some would sniffily call the trashier end of cinema. My list of all-time favourites changes and grows, but in terms of the films that have had the strongest influence on me, Blade Runners sits at the top of the list. I love the future noir world it creates, the darkness and rain-slick reality of it all. It’s a film I’ll never get tired of watching.... TV DRAMASThere’s been such a surge in good telly over the last decade that now I’m finding I can’t keep up with it all, but I try to at least get a sense of the big hits just so I can stay in pace! Recently, I’ve really enjoyed WestWorld, Mr Robot and Strike Back – three very different shows that together scratch my itch for drama, intrigue and action. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’ve always liked the female assassin trope in fiction, and one of my favourite examples is the titular Nikita from the Luc Besson movie of the same name. A broken, human killer, she’s forced into the life of a gun-for-hire and her odyssey is a compelling one. And I love that the character has been reimagined so many times, in American and Chinese remakes and two different TV series. ... FICTIONAL HEROES While I’m a big fan of the three JB’s - James Bond, Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer - each of them exemplifies a classic trope of the action hero/secret agent archetype, and as much fun as they are to watch, I prefer my heroes to be a little more vulnerable, a little more everyman. Richard Hannay from The 39 Steps, Jack Ryan from The Hunt for Red October, John McLane from Die Hard – these are all guys who have to work hard for their victories, coming through bloody but unbowed at the end. ... MURDER WEAPONSWith this one, I’m immediately thinking of that scene from John Wick, where the mob boss talks about seeing Wick killing three men...with a pencil. Then in the sequel, we get to see him actually do it! ... DEATH SCENEA particularly grisly death in my friend Ben Aaronovitch’s Broken Homes involves the murder of a book thief whose is burned to death...from the inside out.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI scour technology, science and military sites for source material for my thrillers – among my most often-opened tabs are Havocscope, New Scientist, War Is Boring and Wired. If MI5 are monitoring my computer, they must have a very interesting file on me by now.... WRITING TIPSThere’s lots of advice to be given, but I found the most important piece boils down to two words: Finish It. I often hear inexperienced writers talk about starting projects only to drop them half-done and move on to something else, but I believe if you can’t “land” a story, you’ll never be anything more than a dabbler. No-one wants a half-cooked meal or a taxi that doesn’t take you all the way home – and an unfinished story is no different. I firmly believe finishing what you start is how you grow and improve as a writer.... WRITING SNACKSIf it’s got caffeine in it, I’m interested.About JAMES SWALLOWJames Swallow is the BAFTA-nominated New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling author of over fifty books, including the Marc Dane thrillers NOMAD, EXILE, GHOST and SHADOW.

{"title": "The Closer I Get by Paul Burston", "date": "Tuesday 28 May 2019", "text": "The Closer I GetBy Paul BurstonPublished Orenda Books (E-book - out now; Paperback - 11 July 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionTom is a successful author, but he’s struggling to finish his novel. His main distraction is an online admirer, Evie, who simply won’t leave him alone.Evie is smart, well read and unstable; she lives with her father and her social-media friendships are not only her escape, but everything she has.When she’s hit with a restraining order, her world is turned upside down, and Tom is free to live his life again, to concentrate on writing.But things aren’t really adding up. For Tom is distracted but also addicted to his online relationships, and when they take a darker, more menacing turn, he feels powerless to change things. Because maybe he needs Evie more than he’s letting on.My verdictThe Closer I Get by Paul Burston is a dark tale of obsession and a chilling reminder that while social media can be a brilliant and beneficial forum, it can also be highly dangerous.This is a psychological thriller of modern times, thanks to its very blunt look at friendships, relationships and interactions online. How can we really know the people we respond to on sites such as Facebook or Twitter? In fact, let's face it, we don't know what's going on inside people's heads at all, even those we meet in real life (still waiting for that smartphone app!). It's very easy for all of us to hide behind a public facade. And in the world of social media, you can be pretty much anyone you want to be.The book has a strong sense of Stephen King's Misery, focusing on Tom (a bestselling author now struggling with his second book) and Evie (his over-enthusiastic author-stalker fan). Thanks to social media, the 'celebrity-fan' line between them has been blurred and now Evie is in court.The writing is fantastic, especially in terms of setting (both London and Hastings) and characterisation, and the twisty plot moves along at a cracking pace. I will admit that I laughed at some of the insights into the publishing industry - people and events - as they seemed very familiar. There are elements of courtroom drama, some thrilling and tense action scenes and some particularly tender moments between Tom and Colin, his elderly neighbour.There was a strong sense of unease throughout the book. I could feel the frustration from both sides, alongside a nagging sense of doubt. I really didn't know who to trust - or who could be trusted. Was either one of them telling the truth? And then there was Emma, Tom's best friend, watching the 'car crash' scenario from the sidelines.This book is thought-provoking and frighteningly plausible. I think we all know at least one 'Tom' and 'Evie'! By the end of The Closer I Get, I wasn't sure if I wanted to interact with anyone online ever again. I now realise that my efforts to interact have diminished ever since! Oops."},

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Paul E. Hardisty", "date": "Wednesday 22 May 2019", "text": "Today, I am delighted that PAUL E. HARDISTY is my next victim (I mean, guest) taking part in my Author in the Spotlight. Turbulent Wake was published in paperback by Orenda Books on 16 May 2019. In many ways, Turbulent Wake is very different from your action-packed Claymore Straker series, exploring a father-son relationship, although the writing is just as stunning. What prompted you to write something so different this time?Absolution was the last instalment of the Claymore Straker series. It wrapped up Clay’s story, at least for now, and sent him and Rania off onto the next stage of their lives. I really don’t know what the future will hold for them - it’s up to the reader. I have wanted to be a writer since I was eighteen, and there are so many ideas and fragments of stories I have collected since then, a lifetime of the stuff packed into journals and notebooks and rattling around in my head. In many ways, I have been working on Turbulent Wake since I was eighteen. I guess after thirty-five years it was time to pull it all together. The stuff I am working on now, when I have the time, is different again. Except for the writing – on that I just want to keep improving. Turbulent Wake is very much a journey, not only through your characters’ lives and experiences, but also around the world, through Africa, the Caribbean, London, Canada, South America, USA, Turkey and many more diverse locations. Are these all places you have visited (and visited recently)? How did you ensure that your descriptions were true not only to the specific locations mentioned, but also the time period that each particular chapter focused on? Turbulent Wake is essentially a fictionalised autobiography. It is all very personal, from boyhood memories to adult disappointments. The settings are all places I know well, in a detailed, footprint-in-the-sand, wind-in-your-face kind of way.  As the father, Warren, muses towards the end, life is nothing more than a series of events, some of which might be worth remembering or even sharing with someone else, most not. So yes, it’s all very close.By the end of Turbulent Wake, I felt as though I knew your main characters (Ethan and Warren) very well. How did you make sure that you got to know them so well while you were writing the book? Is there any of you in each of them? This was the most difficult and the easiest book I have written. Easy because it’s so close to me, all of it. My mum read an early version and had a really hard time. It’s dedicated to her. It was also intensely difficult to write for exactly the same reason. It’s hard to strip away the protective shroud and explore things you have tried not to think about for decades.Exploring how our past shapes us (and our relationships with family and friends) is a common theme in your books. What inspires you to explore this?I am fascinated by the concept of chance.  Luck. Destiny. The blind, impassive, uncaring, arrow of time.  Call it what you may. So much of who we all are is determined by this. Who are parents are. Where and when we are born. The apparently random decisions made by others. Buffeted by these fates, we navigate through our lives as best we can, making mistakes, sometimes learning, always struggling. It makes you. And then, it’s over.  That’s what Turbulent Wake is all about: navigating this stormy sea, and the turbulence each of us leaves behind.Your books always manage to educate me with their underlying environmental themes. Is this something you specifically set out to do when writing them or is this just the way they evolve, due to your own background as an engineer and environmental scientist?The environment, as we call it, is the planet. It’s where we live. It supports all life, including ours. Without it, we would not exist. In the past, the environment (nature) was something awesome, unimaginably huge and powerful. Every day was a struggle to survive. The environment was a threat, something to be feared, conquered, and ultimately, defeated. Our literature is full of this story, from Beowulf to Moby Dick. But now, everything has changed. The 21st Century is completely different. The environment is now everywhere degraded, polluted, under threat. Extinctions are commonplace. True wilderness has disappeared. In all our history, we have never lived in this kind of world. One in which the environment itself is at risk, and we are the ones to be feared. It is a fundamental and unprecedented shift in the human condition. I want to write books for and of the 21st Century. This theme is, for me, inescapable.What's the most interesting place you have visited when researching one of your books? And what's the strangest?Until now, all of my books have been set in places and based on events that are very close to me. So research has been limited. I guess you could say my life and work as an engineer has been my research. The most amazing place I have lived and worked was Yemen – a cruel, beautiful, tragic place, now once again engulfed in civil war. My first novel The Abrupt Physics of Dying, is set there, during the 1994 civil war. I was there when the war broke out. The strangest place I’ve lived and worked has got to be the USA. Extremes of poverty and wealth, education and ignorance, avant-guard thinking and the deepest conservatism side-by-side everywhere you go. And big, in every way.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less? Conflict. Action. Emotion. Depth. Detail. Ideas. Challenge. Intensity. Immediacy.If you were writing a book about your life, what would the title be? Turbulent Wake.What advice would you give your younger self?Don’t waste a single minute. And lastly, why should people read Turbulent Wake?The decisions we make echo through time, profoundly shaping our own lives and those of the people we are closest to.  Everyone lies, not only to protect themselves, but to protect, and sometimes to hurt, others. Life is one big mystery. Can the truthful account of a few key moments in one man’s life unravel part of the mystery? If that sounds fun, give it a go.About Paul E.

AUTHORSFyodor Dostoevsky.I like crime novels that draw me in to a real world populated by real characters, and Dostoevsky is the master at that. Raskolnikov’s struggle with his guilt in Crime and Punishment is one of the greatest tales in literature. ... FILMS/MOVIESThe Silence of the Lambs. FBI trainee Clarice Starling and serial killer Hannibal Lecter are the most thrilling and intriguing odd couple in the history of crime movies. Everything about the film is great, as is the novel it was based on, but the two central characters elevate it to something more. They’ve rightly become iconic. ... TV DRAMASBreaking Bad. I loved the Shakespearean transformation from ordinary decent man to The One Who Knocks. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibal Lecter: I don’t normally go for the “Killer as Artist” or “Killer as Philosopher” tropes, but you’ve got to make an exception for Hannibal. He just enjoys killing so much – and he’s so good at it.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Columbo. I liked the fact that you knew straight away who had committed the crime. None of that red herring stuff. And then you could just sit back and watch as he shuffled around in his grotty raincoat, outwitting the evildoers who constantly underestimated him. I later found out that the character of Lieutenant Columbo was inspired in part by Porfiry Petrovich in Crime and Punishment, which made me feel very clever for liking him.... MURDER WEAPONSDeath by larva. I once killed-off a baddy by tying him to a chair, making hundreds of little cuts all over his skin and tucking a maggot into each one. ... DEATH SCENEHereditary.

In all genres of popular crime writing today, detective characters figure prominently. What is the life of a detective actually like? What was it like in 1890 or 1990? Former detective Stuart Gibbon and crime historian Stephen Wade answer these questions in this new companion guide. This new volume provides an ideal companion volume to the authors' previous book, The Crime Writer's Casebook.My verdictBeing a Detective is yet another fascinating book for crime readers and writers, from former detective Stuart Gibbon and crime historian Stephen Wade. It's subtitled 'A Crime Writers' and Readers' A-Z of Detective Work Past and Present'.Arranged in an A to Z form, the book is easy to dip into, and I found myself learning plenty of new facts each time. It's written in a chatty style with some highly technical topics explained in the right tone of voice for the layperson and personal insights from the authors. The book is bang up-to-date (e.g. number spoofing, contactless card fraud, shoulder surfing, drones) but historical context is included too.The topics in the book are highly varied, from Body Language Forensics and Cashpoint Robbery Crimes to Training to Become a Detective and You're Nicked. I loved the case studies dotted strategically throughout the book bringing the facts to life.Crime writers will find this book particularly useful, whether it's as a starting point for new ideas or a resource for the right facts, procedures and terminology. When I was in my late teens (and early 20s) and first realised I wanted to write crime fiction, I collected the American 'Howdunit' series of books, with topics including cause of death, deadly doses and scene of the crime. I still have the series but the books are not only US-focused but also very out of date. Two brilliant Straightforward Guides are already available (the first one being called The Crime Writer's Casebook), and this is turning into an essential bookshelf series. I hope there's another one on its way!"},

{"title": "Little: A Novel by Edward Carey", "date": "Tuesday 14 May 2019", "text": "Little: A NovelBy Edward CareyPublished by Aardvark Bureau (16 May 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionBorn in Alsace in 1761, the unsightly, diminutive Marie Grosholtz is quickly nicknamed “Little”. Orphaned at the age of six, she finds employment in the household of reclusive anatomist, Dr Curtius. Her role soon surpasses that of mere servant as the eccentric doctor takes an interest in his newfound companion and begins to instruct her in the fine art of wax modelling.From the gutters of pre-revolutionary France to the luxury of the Palace of Versailles, from clutching the still-warm heads of Robespierre’s Terror to finding something very like love, Little traces the improbable fortunes of a bloodstained crumb of a thing who went on to shape the world...My verdictLittle is a unique gothic historical novel. Not only is it written beautifully but it is illustrated beautifully too.This is the reimagined memoir of the little girl who became one of the world's renowned waxwork artists, Madame Tussauds. The writing is poetic, with often-humorous descriptions of its vibrant characters, as little orphaned Marie Grosholtz (nicknamed 'Little') is taken into employment by a reclusive anatomist and artist. I laughed, I grimaced, I cried and I winced, as the author transported me back in time to the French Revolution.This book is rich in history and science, darkness and despair, power and intrigue, beauty and tenderness. It's gruesome and eccentric, wonderfully weird, whacky and even wicked in places, as is the concept of creating waxworks, not just of the best in society but also of the worst.Little is like nothing I have read before, and I will possible never read anything like it again. As already mentioned briefly, the intricate illustrations are outstanding, bringing the author's descriptions to life. I read this book incredibly slowly, just so that I could savour the language of the prose.Just like Madame Tussaud's legacy, this book is innovative, quirky and highly memorable - a story of an extraordinary life as well as a stunning work of art."},

Coerced into robbing rich people’s homes by his bullying older siblings, he’s also trying to care for his little sister and his drug-addict mum.On a job, his brother Barry stabs a homeowner and leaves her for dead, but that’s just the beginning of their nightmare, because the woman is the wife of Edinburgh’s biggest crime lord, Deke Holt.With the police and the Holts closing in, and his shattered family in devastating danger, Tyler meets posh girl Flick in another stranger’s house, and he thinks she may just be his salvation … unless he drags her down too.My verdictBreakers is a compelling, gritty crime novel that shattered my heart. So different from the authors' previous novel, Faultlines, but just as brilliant.Set mainly in a deprived area of Edinburgh, this is an honest, and often brutal, portrayal of a broken family ruined by drink, drugs and crime. Yet it's also filled with glimmers of light, as 17-year-old Tyler is determined to create a better life for himself and his younger sister Bethany.I struggled to put Breakers down. This character-led psychological thriller is filled with astute observations, vivid descriptions and punchy dialogue. Taut writing means that every word counts. It's tense and shocking and felt very real. I was so invested in the characters that I had to know how it ended, holding my breath during some of the final chapters - I had to know that Tyler and Bethany were safe.Breakers is a story of family, love and responsibility. A story of resilience and determination in a toxic world, with a teenager fighting against nature and nurture to do what's right. And a story that highlights the rich-poor divide and that possessions shouldn't (and don't) define us, as it's what's inside us that counts.This is a book that will give you food for thought - and characters who will stay with you long after you've turned the final page.Follow the Blog Tour"},

AUTHORSWhen it comes to thrillers, I adore Robert Harris, John Le Carré and Lee Child, but my current favourite is Lionel Davidson. I devoured Kolymsky Heights, raced through Rose of Tibet and lingered onthe delicate and tragic Smith’s Gazelle.... FILMS/MOVIESAn Oscar winning film, The Lives of Others, set in 1984 East Germany is a subtle but thrilling portrayal of good people betrayed by those who should protect them. Sebastian Koch is a joy to watch, but it is the internal journey of secret policeman Ulrich Mühe that captivates.(2006 Das Leben der Anderen Florian Henckel von Dennersmark)... TV DRAMASFor its perfect combination of superb writing and faultless acting, I have to pick The Killing. The intricate plot, the honest exploration of bereavement, the charismatic politician, all arebrilliantly handled but it is Sofie Gräbøl’s gritty portrayal of Detective Sarah Lund that steals the show for me.(2007 Forbrydelsen Birger Larsen)... FICTIONAL KILLERSIt is very hard to think of a more chilling and compelling character than Dr Hannibal Lecter (in Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris). I like my antagonists cerebral, and my fava beans sautéed.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I am more interested in reluctant detectives who operate outside the constraints of police procedure, which is why I warmed to the intrepid V.I. Warshawski (Sara Paretsky) and the naughty Nick Belsey (Oliver Harris). But I’ll make an exception for my current favourites Captain Sam Wyndham and Sergeant “Surrender Not” Banerjee of the Calcutta Police Force in the brilliant series by Abir Mukherjee set in 1920’s India.... MURDER WEAPONSAn elephant (stomping in A Necessary Evil by Abir Mukherjee)....

WRITING TIPSReadRead outside your genre, fiction and non-fiction, poetry, drama and prose. Read inside your genre: the good – to push yourself; the bad – to avoid the same pitfalls; and the ugly - to work out why it doesn’t work for you as a reader. Act as a beta reader for others - not just so they return the favour, but to hone your surgical skills before you turn to murderous vivisection on your own manuscript.WriteWrite lots. Write every day. If you are stuck, write “I remember…” and just see what flows. If you’re stuck with the novel, write some flash fiction, poetry or short stories instead. Write for yourself.

{"title": "The Way of All Flesh by Ambrose Parry", "date": "Monday 6 May 2019", "text": "The Way of All FleshBy Ambrose ParryPublished by Canongate Books (2 May 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionEdinburgh, 1847. Will Raven is a medical student, apprenticing for the brilliant and renowned Dr Simpson. Sarah Fisher is Simpson's housemaid, and has all of Raven's intelligence but none of his privileges.As bodies begin to appear across the Old Town, Raven and Sarah find themselves propelled headlong into the darkest shadows of Edinburgh's underworld. And if either of them are to make it out alive, they will have to work together to find out who's responsible for the gruesome deaths.My verdictThe Way of All Flesh is the first in a new series of historical crime novels. It's chilling, gripping and vivid and took me right into the heart of the darkness of 19th century Edinburgh.I loved not only the historical background but the medical background too, both twined together by a common thread - the invention of anaesthesia and the rise of early modern scientific techniques. The authors have carefully placed real life characters and events within a largely fictional setting by focusing on a series of gruesome murders. Will Raven and Sarah Fisher make a believable pairing as they work together, somewhat reluctantly at first, to solve these crimes.The Way of All Flesh is a must-read for all historical crime fiction fans. It was fun, entertaining, fascinating and brutal, with well-developed characters and a well-paced plot. The book features a strong mix of mystery, history of medicine, social history, science, art (photography) and even some romance. I can't wait to read the next one in the series (The Art of Dying), which is being published in hardback in August 2019. Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "My Jewish-themed Reads Part 4", "date": "Friday 3 May 2019", "text": "Earlier this year, I was an official book blog partner of Jewish Book Week in London. If you follow me on Twitter or follow Off-the-Shelf Books, you'll know that I'm writing Jewish-themed crime fiction and I've made it my mission to read more Jewish-themed books this year. Here are three more Jewish-themed reads - more to come soon!Testament by Kim Sherwood Published in paperback by riverrun on 13 June 2019 (already out in hardback and ebook)Publisher's descriptionOf everyone in her complicated family, Eva was always closest to her grandfather. She is making a film about his life. She is with him when he dies. It is only when she finds the letter from the Jewish Museum in Berlin, hidden in his painting studio, that she realises how many secrets he kept.As she uncovers everything he endured in the Holocaust - and what it took to learn to live again - Eva is confronted by the lies that haunt her family, and a truth that changes her own identity.My verdictTestament is an outstanding debut novel about hope, survival, family and courage. Eva is the granddaughter of a world-renowned artist who 'reinvented' himself after surviving labour camps in Austria. Joseph Silk told his family nothing about his traumatic experiences, but now his testimony (which he wanted destroyed) has been found by the Jewish Museum in Berlin. Eva gradually pieces together the tragedy in his past and the grief he carried with him for most of his life. Testament is an exploration of how the past can shape our lives - not just our own past, but that of previous generations. It's beautifully written with vivid poetic descriptive prose. Eva has to make a decision - should her grandfather be remembered by his testimony or by the art he has created since. Unlike many other Holocaust-themed books, Testament explores how Holocaust survivors chose to live their lives afterwards, torn between putting the traumatic past behind them or sharing their stories to educate future generations. An enjoyable read - out in paperback soon!The Immortalists by Chloe BenjaminPublished by Tinder Press in July 2018Publisher's descriptionIt's 1969, and holed up in a grimy tenement building in New York's Lower East Side is a travelling psychic who claims to be able to tell anyone the date they will die. The four Gold children, too young for what they're about to hear, sneak out to learn their fortunes.Such prophecies could be dismissed as trickery and nonsense, yet the Golds bury theirs deep. Over the years that follow they attempt to ignore, embrace, cheat and defy the 'knowledge' given to them that day - but it will shape the course of their lives forever.My verdictOn the surface, The Immortalists is a family drama set against a backdrop of Jewish practices and family expectations. But the clever premise means there's so much more bubbling below. This is a story of mortality, fate, grief, love and guilt. Beautiful writing and a powerful story took me on a journey through the decades, as I immersed myself into the lives of the four Gold siblings. The book focuses on each sibling in turn, with the life decisions they made and any resulting consequences - some stories slightly stronger than others. The Immortalists isn't what I would call an uplifting read and wasn't always an easy one, but it's certainly thought provoking. How would you live your life if you believed that a particular day would be your last?Unbroken by Madeleine BlackPublished in April 2017Publisher's description: Violently gang-raped when she was thirteen years old, and raped three more times before the age of eighteen, Madeleine has experienced more trauma in her life than most ever will.Living in a state of shock and self-loathing, it took her years of struggle to confront the buried memories of that first attack and begin to undo the damage it wrought, as men continued to take advantage of her fragility in the worst possible way.Yet, after growing up with a burden no teenager should ever have to shoulder, she found the heart to carry out the best revenge plan of all: leading a fulfilling and happy life. But the road to piecing her life back together was long and painful. For Madeleine, forgiveness was the key. True forgiveness takes genuine effort. It takes a real desire to understand those who have done us so much harm. It is the ultimate act of courage.My verdictUnbroken is a hard-hitting memoir. This is the story of a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl from North-West London who was brutally raped, not just once but several times - a horrific night that shaped the rest of her life. This was a painful book to read, so I can't even comprehend how difficult it must have been to write. Some of the descriptions are brutal and graphic, yet Unbroken is much more than just a book about rape. Following years of struggle and self-loathing, Madeleine Black found the strength to embark on a journey of self-discovery and to learn to forgive, love and hope. And this book IS her journey, dwelling far more on her search for acceptance and peace as she comes to terms with the past. This isn't a book that you can 'enjoy' but it's a powerful story of a woman's resilience and courage. A lesson to us all.So that's it for now! But I have many more Jewish-themed books on my list and will reading (and reviewing) them over the coming months. So do pop back to Off-the-Shelf Books for more updates!"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Andy Griffee", "date": "Thursday 2 May 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome ANDY GRIFFEEto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSRaymond Chandler.  I have always been a sucker for Philip Marlowe (who, of course, I picture as Humphrey Bogart).  I love the concept of a hero prowling the mean streets who 'is not mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid' and who likes a glass or five or whisky. But most of all, I love the sardonic deadpan wit of someone who is immersed in the messy corruption of venal people and yet somehow, also seems to hover above it.  I still have a quiet chuckle to myself when I remember lines like, 'she was a blonde, a blonde to make a bishop kick in a stained-glass window' or 'he looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food cake.' He took crime fiction by the scruff of the neck and kicked it out of the Home Counties drawing rooms. His hero has been often-imitated but rarely, if ever, improved upon. He created the original hard-boiled gumshoe detective and I have been a fan since I read The Big Sleep as a teenager.... FILMS/MOVIESOkay…it's not a crime movie and it may not be the finest film ever made, but my DVD copy of Master and Commander: Far Side of the World is easily the most viewed film in my collection. I am a huge admirer of the 21 seafaring novels by Patrick O'Brian which follow the fortunes of the British naval officer, Jack Aubrey and his friend, the naval surgeon, naturalist and spy Stephen Maturin.  Having read the entire series from cover to cover, twice on the trot, I was nervous that Peter Weir's 2003 film would fail to do justice to the books. I need not have worried. He uses some of the characters, plot and dialogue from the books without faithfully reproducing any single book's plot. The film captures the spirit of the amazing friendship at the heart of the series of novels and respects O'Brien's painstaking historical authenticity without getting in the way of a rollicking good story. The movie captures the awesome scale of the sea and the hardships of life on board. It is a really satisfying movie which I return to again and again. ... TV DRAMASAt the moment, there is only one compelling British-made TV crime drama which is appointment-to-view and towers over the competition. It is Peaky Blinders. The BBC gangster family epic is set in 1919 Birmingham and describes the expansion of a criminal gang who sew razor blades into the peaks of their caps and is led by their charismatic and cunning boss, Tommy Shelby.  The acting by Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, Sam Neill, Paul Anderson, Tom Hardy, Benjamin Zephaniah et al is outstanding.  Although it was mostly filmed in Yorkshire, its sense of place is rooted in the industrial grimness of England's second city in the aftermath of the World War 1. The strongly drawn characters and high-stakes plotting is complemented by great costume design and a directorial flair that at times is breathtaking. Four series have been screened so far and there are another three to look forward to. I am counting the days. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSMy favourite fictional killer is, with no shadow of doubt, Tom Ripley. Patricia Highsmith described her anti-hero as a 'suave, agreeable and utterly amoral' con-artist and serial killer who always evades justice. You find yourself admiring his sophisticated taste for fine food, wine and art and the depth of his love for his partners – and then you realise with a jolt that you are rooting for a violent psychopath. You know you shouldn't be hoping he thrives, let alone survives, and yet you do. I was transfixed by the sequence of Ripley novels and slightly horrified by how drawn I was to Tom's character.  Therein lies Highsmith's magnificent achievement. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Whilst I have a weakness for P.D.James's Commander Adam Dalgleish with his calm manner, Jaguar sports car and poetry writing, perhaps he is a little too superior and detached. I feel much the same about Susan Hill's Detective Chief Inspector Simon Serrailler, another middle-aged and slightly aloof English bachelor whose spare-time sketches are worthy of gallery space but who struggles with close personal relationships. No, when it comes to fictional detectives, I'm looking for the wit, character and uncompromising courage of a Philip Marlowe - and so I finally choose Philip Kerr's detective, the Berlin private investigator Bernie Gunther.  Bernie served 11 years as a homicide detective in Berlin just as Hitler's National Socialists were coming to power. I love his jaundiced commentary on both his own failings and the corrupt and deviant viciousness of the Nazis who are all around him.  He compromises to survive during hellish times, but maintains a personal bravery, honesty and overwhelming decency as well as a brilliant mind.  The atmosphere and detail of the 14-book series is so convincing that I was amazed when I discovered that Kerr was a British writer. Sadly, he died in March 2018 and I am so sad that I shall no longer be able to read of Bernie Gunther's trials and tribulations. ... MURDER WEAPONSThe murder weapon which still stabs deep into my memory is the Marttiini, a slim Finnish-made blade which is kept in a lightly oiled sheath and belongs to the serial killer who haunts Complicity, a crime thriller by the late Scottish writer Iain Banks. This is one of the most dog-eared paperbacks on my book shelves which I re-read every couple of years. Its chapters alternate between a troubled newspaper reporter's first-person narrative and a second person account of a serial killer's activities in and around Edinburgh.  The bizarre and sadistic murders are acted out on a series of unpleasant right-wing capitalists in ever more ingenious ways.  Slowly, a connection between the killings and a previous article by the journalist is established.  In one, an arms-dealing MP is tied to a chicken wire gate and has an artery slashed after watching his much-loved fox-hounds get shot. The methods of killing match the immoral activities of the victims in a gruesome way and the plot drives forward in a bleak but compellingly imaginative way.  As a former journalist, I enjoyed the underlying focus on journalism and the extreme nihilism which is uncompromised by the book's ending. The surprises in Complicity linger long in the memory and, although not as famous as Banks's Wasp Factory and The Crow Road, is well worth seeking out by crime fiction aficionados. ... BLOGS/WEBSITESMy fictional hero, Jack Johnson, lives on a 64 ft long canal boat and moves around the country's canals and waterways - so the most vital source material I use is the series of excellent pocket guide books by J.M.Pearson & Son Ltd which map out every single lock, bridge and towpath pub.  Pearsons have kindly allowed me to replicate some of their maps so readers can trace the fictional journeys with their fingers and even explore the geography of the novels for themselves should they wish. ... WRITING TIPSIt would be presumptive for this debut novelist to give writing tips before finding out whether anyone actually enjoys my books. However, I have now learnt the difference between a pantster and a plotter.  My first book, Canal Pushers, took more than two years to complete because I made it up as I went along and needed to juggle the interconnections between three distinctly different plotlines. Long daily dog walks proved to be the answer to filling the day's blank pages. The second book (provisionally entitled River Rats) had every chapter carefully plotted out from beginning to end and took just six months to complete.  The third, I hope, will benefit from experience and be a blend of the two. However, I have found the snooker table in my study to be very convenient to lay out 30 small sheets of paper – one for each chapter – and juggle the contents accordingly. ... WRITING SNACKSI write from 10 am to 4pm – stopping for a brief sandwich lunch and then to make sure dinner is on the table for my hard-working wife after her day at St Richard's Hospice in Worcester. The odd chocolate biscuit has been known to join the morning coffee at the desk, but other than that the snacks are all given to the three dogs (two border terriers and an English springer spaniel.)About ANDY GRIFFEEAndy Griffee is a former BBC journalist and media consultant with a fascination for stories.

{"title": "Locations are characters by Neil White", "date": "Thursday 25 April 2019", "text": "Today, I am delighted to welcome Neil White to Off-the-Shelf Books to talk about locations and settings. The Innocent Ones was published by Hera Books on 24 April 2019.Locations are charactersBy Neil WhiteLocations are characters, whether they are real or not. Even the made-up ones have their roots in real-life.My next book, The Innocent Ones, will be my thirteenth, if I include my stand-alone non-crime Johnny Cash novel, Lost In Nashville, and I’ve always moved around the north of England. But that was never my original intention.When I first started writing, I wanted to write an American novel. The reason was simple: I prefer American crime fiction.Not that there’s anything wrong with British-set crime fiction. In fact, in recent years it has got better, with the increase in popularity of psychological thrillers, as the closed-in, relationship-set nature of them somehow suits the repressed nature of the British psyche. Everything on the outside seems normal, but there are darker things happening on the inside.No, the reason is much simpler. I’m a criminal lawyer. I spend my days in English courtrooms. I don’t always want to spend my evenings wallowing in fictional English courtrooms, or in police investigations that will end up in English courtrooms. I want a break from all that and to visit more exotic or exciting places in my leisure time, where I’m not looking out for technical errors.My first attempt at writing was an American-set novel, called Salem. I followed it up with another, with scenes set in Chicago and a small town in Indiana called Creek Crossing. Although Salem saw the light as a typo-filled self-published work, publishers didn’t want them. And why should they? There are enough good American writers without a pale imitation like me trying to crash the party. So, I rewrote them, and Chicago became London and a small town in Indiana became a small town in Lancashire called Turners Fold. Avon came knocking, if you’ll excuse the pun, and my first published novel, Fallen Idols, entered the world.Searching for an English location hadn’t been easy though. Although I lived in Lancashire, I grew up on the other side of the Pennines, in Wakefield, and for ten years, from aged twelve, in the seaside town of Bridlington. My heart told me to set them in Wakefield or Bridlington, but my head told me that the answer could be nearer to home. If nothing else, the research involved less travelling.It was a Who Do You Think You Are episode featuring Jane Horrocks that changed things, because they presented the Rossendale area of Lancashire very picturesquely, with old wrought iron lampposts and large mills that either stood empty or redeveloped. I started to see the area differently, where even the decay looked atmospheric, so I decided on the old cotton towns for the setting, although it was a morning in court that provided the actual location.For the book Fallen Idols, I wanted a setting in a small town that was the kind of place where teenagers hang around and drink illicit bottles of cider and try out cigarettes, away from critical adult eyes. I was in court one day, in Accrington, prosecuting a youth who had burned down a brick aviary in a small town called Great Harwood. When I asked around about this aviary, I realised it was a perfect setting, on the edge of a park, so I shot to Great Harwood during my lunchbreak. By the time I returned for my afternoon court session, I’d discovered my location.Turners Fold, and the nearest larger town of Blackley, lived on for five books. Blackley was a mix of the Lancashire cotton towns along the Leeds-Liverpool canal, but I kept it fictional, as I didn’t want the real locations to limit the story. That way, I could borrow a viaduct from one town and something from somewhere else.Eventually, the big city beckoned, and I took my Parker brothers trilogy to Manchester, and this time I let the city dictate things. I knew Manchester because I had trained to be a lawyer there, and it is a perfect setting for a crime book. So much history and so much grit. It has everything.But I had a yearning for the hills again, so I brought the Dan Grant books back to rural Lancashire, this time the fictional town of Highford, although locals may recognise it as Burnley, which is where I was located as a Senior Crown Prosecutor for sixteen years.The vibe I was after was Happy Valley but in a courtroom setting. A legal thriller without the glamour of the big city.Despite the setting, however, as The Innocent Ones is the final book in the Dan Grant trilogy, I decided that it was time to explore my own personal locations and say hello to the places that were important to me.The book is set mainly in Highford, as always, but there is some time spent in a small seaside town in Yorkshire called Brampton. People who have visited that part of the world might recognise it as Bridlington, where I spent my teens. There is also a scene in a house in Wakefield, 19 Rockley Drive. That was my home as a child. It was an affectionate nod.I said at the beginning that locations are characters, and that is how I feel. The setting governs how people respond, because things happen differently in different places. In The Innocent Ones, the book begins in a small deserted park. In a different place, it would be a different park, perhaps overlooked by high-rise flats, or just a cut-through to somewhere. In The Innocent Ones, however, it is a Highford park, so it is quiet and cold, with views over a valley, the stars like bright dots.For the future, I think I’m back to the big city though. Which city, of course, is something that will have to be revealed at a later date, with a new set of lead characters and a whole more heap of dead bodies.            About Neil WhiteNeil White has written thirteen novels, including the number one ebook bestseller, Cold Kill. His first six books were published by Avon, followed by three books with Sphere involving the Parker brothers.

Imprisoned. Pregnant.Jenna thought she had the perfect life: a loving fiancé, a great job, a beautiful home. Then she finds her stepdaughter murdered; her partner missing.And the police think she did it...Locked up to await trial, surrounded by prisoners who'd hurt her if they knew what she's accused of, certain someone close to her has framed her, Jenna knows what she needs to do:Clear her nameSave her babyFind the killerBut can she do it in time?My verdictOn My Life is a punchy whodunnit that was impossible to put down.The premise drew me in straight away, along with compelling writing and a tense race against the clock, with Jenna determined to clear her name to save herself and her baby. The snappy chapters switch between Now and Then, contrasting Jenna's seemingly great life in the past with her current situation.As well as being a fast-paced psychological thriller, this is a shocking portrayal of pregnant women (and young vulnerable women) in prison and their lack of rights and access to information. Descriptions of prison life were harrowing at times and so realistic that I felt as though I was there too - hearing every slam of a cell door and experiencing the women's claustrophobia and fear.Another well-researched crime novel that's taught me something, as well as entertained me, and left me musing over a system that's clearly in desperate need of reform.Definitely Angela Clarke's best book yet! Can't wait to see what's next!"},

I'm coming for you next.After you've read this book, you'll know: the truth is far more twisted...My verdictWell, Twisted certainly does what it says on the tin - fills the reader's head with twists from beginning to end, with tension and suspense all the way through.Twisted is Steve Cavanagh's first standalone, following his successful Eddie Flynn series. Thirteen, the most recent book is such a brilliant read, so you must check this series out. And the author couldn't resist mentioning Eddie Flynn in Twisted, I noticed!So, back to Twisted.The plot is centred around an elusive bestselling crime fiction author who prides himself on the killer twists in his books. No one knows who he is - not even his publishers. When Paul Cooper's wife, Maria, discovers his bank account statement, she realises that her husband has been keeping secrets - and now it's time to take what she's owed.This is certainly lots of fun, with a rising body count and plenty of surprises in store. I can imagine it must have been lots of fun to write too, blasting the reader with twist after twist after twist. The characters are all quite insane, even the detectives conducting the investigation into a break-in at Paul and Maria's home.This entertaining rollercoaster ride of a read is thrilling crime fiction fans - and I'm not surprised!Follow Blog Tour Week 2"},
{"title": "Passover and the diversity of diversity... ", "date": "Friday 12 April 2019", "text": "... and why it can be a challenge to please everyone (plus a bit more about the book I’m writing).I originally wrote this post last year. In one week, the Jewish festival of Pesach (Passover) begins, so it's a good time to share this post again with a few minor changes. This post of mine is based on a comment I made in a Facebook group (for bloggers and authors) in February 2018. We were discussing Lionel Shriver’s article in The Guardian (you can read the Guardian article here), which raised many questions within the group:Should we only write about the life we know?Or should we feel comfortable writing about a life we don’t know?Should we write about topics we haven’t experienced - and may never experience?Or should we only write about topics we have experienced?I'm writing Jewish-themed crime fiction. I've never committed a murder (you'll be pleased to know), but I do keep many of the Jewish traditions and live in a Jewish area, so to some degree I am writing about what I know. Yet this doesn't make writing a novel any easier. I still need engaging characters, a great plot and a believable setting (and I'm working hard on those, if anyone's interested). It also brings up other challenges for me, as I'm explaining concepts and practices I take for granted to people who know nothing (or very little) about the religion. I'm not ready to share any details about my plot, but my main character is a journalist who is learning about the religion as she investigates some possible crimes - which helps to take the reader on a journey of discovery too.Many people show interest when I tell them what I'm writing. Comments include:'Jewish-themed crime fiction is definitely something different.''I don't know much about Judaism so would love to learn more.''Get on and write it - I can't wait to read it.'Judaism in the UKJews make up only 0.5% of the UK's religious groups - much less than Christians, those with no religion, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs in the chart. It often surprises people when I tell them this fact, as Jews seem so prominent within society and we are not considered by many to be an ethnic or religious 'minority group'.In February 2019, a DNA analysis by My Heritage revealed that I am 97.5% Ashkenazi Jewish and 2.5% Middle Eastern. Who says being Jewish isn't in the blood or an ethnic group? Bizarrely, the test revealed that I have a very close DNA match with a 90-year-old woman (and her family) with a surname that's very similar to one of my great-grandparents' surnames - not a common surname at all.Many people tell me they've never met anyone Jewish before - yet, how would they know, as we look and behave like everyone else. Ignorance breeds antisemitism and racism - this is something that needs to be addressed and one of the reasons I'm writing this book. My book begins with an antisemitic attack by two teenagers against a Jewish woman. Most people don't realise how much antisemitism occurs in the UK and that it is on the rise, as the incidents often don't make the national news. According to the Campaign Against Antisemitism, one in three British Jews has considered leaving Britain in the past two years due to antisemitism, with concern mounting over failures to tackle antisemitic crime and antisemitism in politics. Universities throughout the country are now a breeding ground for anti-Israel and antisemitic behaviour. According to the Community Security Trust, there were 1,382 antisemitic incidents recorded nationwide in 2017 - a record level in the UK.Diversity within JudaismThe Facebook group discussion moved on to the concept of diversity and whether it's possible to write books that appeal to diverse readers if you're not part of that group yourself. My point was that it will always be difficult to please everyone but you do have to make sure your book is well researched - and others in the discussion agreed.Just as there is diversity in the country as a whole, there is diversity within all communities and there isn't (or shouldn't be) such thing as a stereotype. The Jewish population in the UK is an example of this. You have the ultra-religious communities, who may dress and behave in a particular way (and are most easily identified as being Jewish). You may see them in parts of London, Greater London and Manchester, for example. Then you have the non-observant Jews, who don't keep any of the traditions, but are still Jewish because it's in their blood and are proud of their Jewish heritage. And then you have everyone else in between.My book is set in a fictional town based on where I live, with some more observant Jewish families and some who keep very little of their religion but still identify themselves as being Jewish. Despite living in a fairly Jewish area, many people around here (including us) have experienced antisemitism (some openly, some disguised and some completely shocking).Next weekend, the Jewish festival of Pesach (Passover) begins. This is one of the most commonly observed festivals, even by many people who are otherwise normally non-observant. But as with all diverse groups, everyone keeps the festival in their own way - so I'll use this as an example. It's one reason why I've been busy recently and will be for another couple of weeks.Some Jewish people observe all of the 'rules' and others observe very few - and some in between. Even where I live, members of our Synagogue observe it in different ways, at different levels of religiosity. This is a clear example of diversity within one Jewish community.What is Pesach?Pesach, which lasts for eight days, commemorates the exodus of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The name Pesach (Passover) comes from the miracle when God passed over the houses of the Israelites during the 10th plague  - 'Death of the First Born'. The festival has many different features. It's too complicated to explain in detail, but here's a relatively short summary:1. We eat special foods. We eat matzah (unleavened bread) rather than bread, reminding us that the Israelites didn't have time to let their bread rise when they left Egypt in a hurry. Matzah is made from flour and water and cooked very quickly. It's flat, like a cracker. I can't say I'm a great fan of it - I think of it as edible cardboard - but other people (including my husband and Dad) like it! Pesach is more complicated than just eating Matzah though, as all of our food (other than fruit, vegetables, meat/poultry and fish) has to be specially made for Pesach - even down to cooking oil, tins of tuna, dairy foods, crisps and chocolate (no Easter eggs!) - to ensure it hasn't been in contact with bread and chametz - see point 2). Some people will just avoid bread and eat matzah during Pesach but won't change any of the other foods they eat. Everyone keeps Pesach in a way that suits them.2. We prepare for Pesach with the ultimate spring clean. We clear our house of bread and other foods (known as chametz - pronounce the 'ch' as in the Scottish 'loch') before Pesach begins. During Pesach, we can't eat pasta, rice, barley and legumes. We use different crockery, cutlery, pots and pans for those eight days, sealing up our kitchen cupboards (so we don't use our 'normal' items) or swapping them around (our Pesach items are stored in boxes in our garage and loft during the rest of the year). We cover all the kitchen surfaces. It's a bit like moving house (or at least, kitchen), with all the preparations beforehand. And yes, it can be stressful (okay, a nightmare).3. We have a special family meal on the first two nights. It's called a Seder, which means 'order', because the meal has a special order that we follow, with specific traditional foods (such as parsley dipped in salt water to symbolise tears shed in slavery and raw horseradish to symbolise the bitterness of slavery). The Seder details, and the story of Pesach, are written in a special book called a Haggadah. Some families only do one Seder on the first night - we do both nights.During the Seder, we sing songs and have discussions. Frogs may be dotted around the table (not real ones, I should add) - as frogs feature in the second plague.Two years ago, we had the parting of the Red Sea down the centre of our Seder table - thanks to blue crepe paper, sand-coloured felt, fish stickers, shell-shaped sequins and Playmobil figures (Egyptians and builders etc). I think I enjoyed making it far more than my teenagers enjoyed seeing it. We even have a big Playmobil pyramid stored in the loft from when my boys were younger.Pesach has many different themes and we do try to relate them to the 'here and now'. One of these is the theme of modern slavery (and not just the obvious - think about how enslaved we are to technology and social media). Then there's the theme of refugee status - as currently seen in Syria. Then finally the theme of antisemitism, which returns to my book. Just as the Jews were persecuted by Pharaoh then, they have been persecuted ever since, with the Holocaust and modern day antisemitic attacks.So should we be free to write about lives different to our own?I know that if I do get my novel published, it may come under a lot of scrutiny and I may be more open to antisemitism - I've already experienced antisemitic behaviour on social media, in response to a tweet about Holocaust Remembrance Day. Yes, this does worry me, but I know that I'll rise above it and have a strong support network of people around me.But I may not only attract criticism from the wider population, and in some ways this worries me more, turning writing this book into more of a challenge to get it right. And this is probably the reason why I've been dragging my feet (or my typing fingers, in this case). As already mentioned above, the Jewish community is diverse. So my personal experience of Judaism probably won't be the same as someone else's. The Jewish characters in my book are also diverse, from a Jewish community like my own.Some Jewish people may disagree with the content of my book if it's ever 'out there', because it's too Jewish, not Jewish enough, tells too much, tells too little, 'we don't do it like that', gives us a bad name... and 'you can't have anyone Jewish committing a crime'. Others may say it's great as it highlights antisemitism, shows that we're like everyone else, raises awareness of Judaism etc - which is exactly what I'm trying to do.I don't think there's any way to 'win' in terms of writing about diverse groups of people, even if we're part of the community ourselves. When we read books, they touch us in many different ways, based on our nature and nurture, our upbringing, our past experiences, our present situation. No two readers will read a book in the same way or respond to it in the same way.And that’s the beauty of reading - and writing.Ultimately, we should be free to write (and read) about what excites us, what motivates us, what challenges us and what drives us.For me, it's crime fiction with a Jewish theme. Watch this space!"},

Mary develops a poisonous obsession with Liam and his world, and when her son and Liam’s daughter form a relationship, Mary will stop at nothing to impose her own brand of justice … with devastating consequences. My verdictFor the last 19 years, I've edited a newsletter about the menopause as part of my day job as a health journalist/editor. So I was delighted to read Worst Case Scenario, as it's not often that I find a menopausal protagonist in a crime novel. I don't just mean a woman 'of a certain age'. I mean one with actual menopausal symptoms - the ones you may know about and the ones you may prefer not to know about!Mary Shields is a foul-mouthed probational officer with clients who have committed some abominable crimes. She wants to help her clients (although some don't want the help she's offering), but struggles with the paperwork and bureaucracy of her job and has finally had enough. She just needs to get through a few more weeks. Worst Case Scenario is dark, insane, shocking and highly entertaining - menopausal AND criminal madness. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments, cringeworthy ones and sad ones too, as protagonist Mary Shields' life falls apart at the seams. She's struggling to juggle her work, family, friendships and drinking habits, as well as cope with her troublesome menopausal symptoms - hot flushes, mood swings, those 'oops' Tena moments (seen the adverts?) and more. She may not come across as a caring individual, but has a strong sense of justice and would do anything for her family. Sadly, she makes terrible decisions and gets herself - and her family - into all sorts of trouble!This is a short book but is hard-hitting and punchy - making up for its size with its highly memorable characters and gritty writing. You'll need a slightly warped sense of humour (lots of slapstick scenarios) and shouldn't take anything TOO seriously.

If you follow my reviews, you'll know how much I'm enjoying Vanda's Sam Shepherd series. The Ringmaster (the second book in the series) is being published in paperback by Orenda Books on 18 April 2019.On reading Vanda's biography, I discovered that we have some shared interests. As well as being a talented crime writer, Vanda is also a pharmacist with a PhD in Science Communication. I write about consumer health for community pharmacists, have an MSc. in Science Communication and LOVE crime fiction. Perfect!So Karen Sullivan at Orenda Books put me in touch with Vanda so that I could ask her about her PhD. Read on to discover more...Science in crime fictionBy Vanda SymonWhat on earth possessed you to do a PhD?For some strange reason I decided that it would be a great to do a PhD – well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. There were two main motivators. I had completed a University of Otago Summer School paper in forensic biology in the name of research for my crime novels. Trouble was, I enjoyed the studying and the topic too much and the course co-ordinator was an utter force of nature and a very persuasive man so when he said Vanda, you should come and join us for a PhD, I thought, why the hell not?The second reason was a little more subjective. I wanted to do this for myself – to prove to myself that I had the wherewithal to undertake a long and rigorous project and see it through. Hand in hand with that was an underlying need to feel people took me seriously – which probably sounds a bit pathetic and needy, but that was the head space I was in when I embarked on the journey.How did you decide on a topic?A lot of people assumed, because I was a writer that I would do a PhD in literature or creative writing. But I am a science gal at heart – my undergraduate degree was in Pharmacy - so I wanted to explore something that wove together the many strands of my world - science, crime writing, and communication. My initial idea was to do something exploring the wonderful New Zealand Crime writer Dame Ngaio Marsh – she wrote 32 Detective Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn novels in the golden era of crime fiction, and was heralded as one of the four Queens of Crime Fiction, along with Agatha Christie, Margerie Allingham and Dorothy Sayers, yet she had been largely forgotten in New Zealand. I wanted to look at her works from a science perspective because she had a knack of knocking people off with in some extraordinarily gruesome and unique ways, and she used poisons a number of times – gold for a pharmacist gal like me. I was also really curious about people’s attitude towards the science they encountered in crime fiction, and if they cared whether or not it was accurate. Somehow I managed to combine all of these elements into my thesis titled The Communication of Science in Crime Fiction.So how did you find out if people cared whether or not the science in crime novels was true?I took advantage of the power of the internet. I created an online survey with a series of questions about accuracy in science, if people liked learning about forensic science in their crime fiction, which authors they trusted to deliver the goods and related things. This was then distributed out into the world via social media, email sharing by libraries, book groups, writers and readers organisations. One thing I did have to do was make sure that people didn’t know that I was the researcher in case it swayed how they responded – I didn’t want them responding how they thought I might want them to! I was thrilled to have over 1000 readers complete the survey. And the amazing thing was how generous people were in their comments at the end of the survey questions – I was very pleasantly surprised.It wasn’t just the readers I targeted – the writers didn’t get off Scott-free. I also created a survey for writers of crime fiction asking if the felt it important to provide accurate science in their fiction, whether they felt ethically obliged to make it correct, and if they worried about things like  copycat crime.So what did you find out? Did people care?They sure did – which you would expect, I know as a reader I hate it when I spot a booboo. But where it got interesting was why, which became apparent in the comments people made. As one reader put it, if there was a mistake in the science, it broke their trust in every element of the novel, characters, plot, everything. When asked if they believed the science they read, they mostly did – but it depended on who the author was. The most trusted author by a country mile was Patricia Cornwell, followed by Kathy Reichs. Interesting that both have careers involved in forensics and science.The authors likewise liked to ensure the science they provided was accurate, with a little bit of wriggle room. For example, they had no issue with compressing time for the sake of avoiding mind-numbing tedium for the reader, so in fiction their lab test results could come back way quicker than they do in real life. Another reason they liked to be accurate was because no one wanted to have a reader point out an error (and believe me, they do!)I was surprised that very few authors were worried about potential copycat crimes from their works, or that criminals would learn from their works, but as a number of them put it – people can learn anything they need to know from the internet. And as one author brilliantly put it -  the bias of crime readership is towards middle-aged women. The bias of violent criminals is emphatically not!Has your research had any impact on your own writing - or how you perceive (and read) fiction containing science?Yes indeed. I was always very careful about accuracy, because I didn’t want to be called out by a reader and made to look like a numpty, but I am probably even more so now. As a reader I have been pretty unforgiving about errors in the science in novels, or the history in historic fiction, and my bull-shit-o-meter is probably even more finely attuned now.The research made me realise that readers actually really enjoy learning a bit of science, in the right context and if it seamlessly fits into the plot and isn’t info-dumped. I have always liked to weave interesting science into my works, and I will shamelessly make the most of my science background to do that in the future. Hmmmm, I feel a poisoning or two coming on…            About Vanda SymonVanda Symon is a crime writer, TV presenter and radio host from Dunedin, New Zealand, and the chair of the Otago Southland branch of the New Zealand Society of Authors.

{"title": "Turbulent Wake by Paul Hardisty", "date": "Thursday 4 April 2019", "text": "Turbulent WakeBy Paul E. HardistyPublished by Orenda Books (E-book: out now; Paperback: 16 May 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionEthan Scofield returns to the place of his birth to bury his father. Hidden in one of the upstairs rooms of the old man’s house he finds a strange manuscript, a collection of stories that seems to cover the whole of his father’s turbulent life.As his own life starts to unravel, Ethan works his way through the manuscript, trying to find answers to the mysteries that have plagued him since he was a child. What happened to his little brother? Why was his mother taken from him? And why, in the end, when there was no one else left, did his own father push him away?My verdictTurbulent Wake is a round-the-world journey through a lifetime of regrets. This one-sided father-son story is intense and emotional - it's very different to Paul E. Hardisty's Claymore Straker series but just as compelling.While Ethan Scofield takes centre stage, this is also the story of his father, Warren, and the relationship between them, gradually revealed as Ethan reads through Warren's manuscript after his death. The title of the book is perfect. The story reminded me of the ocean, switching between moments of calm and moments of turbulence, and back again. It's filled with mishaps and misadventures - life's ups and down, those we can control and those we can't. An insight into how the turbulence of our past can shape not just our future but the future of those around us.The writing is sublime - the beautiful vivid descriptions of flora and fauna and exotic locations have lyrical rhythm. I felt as though I was on location myself, with Ethan, Warren, Helena and all of the other characters. Geography, science and geological references are carefully woven into the prose, with powerful environmental messages. So yet again, Paul E. Hardisty has written a book that not only entertained me but also educated me.Turbulent Wake really showcases the author's writing talent. I read it twice because I loved it so much and to appreciate and discover the many layers. I could read this book forever and it's likely to become one of my all-time Orenda favourites."},
{"title": "A Modern Family by Helga Flatland ", "date": "Friday 29 March 2019", "text": "A Modern FamilyBy Helga FlatlandPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 13 April 2019; Paperback - 13 June 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhen Liv, Ellen and Håkon, along with their partners and children, arrive in Rome to celebrate their father’s seventieth birthday, a quiet earthquake occurs: their parents have decided to divorce.Shocked and disbelieving, the siblings try to come to terms with their parents’ decision as it echoes through the homes they have built for themselves, and forces them to reconstruct the shared narrative of their childhood and family history.My verdictA Modern Family is a beautifully written and highly thought-provoking literary novel exploring the psychology and practicalities of marriage, commitment and individuality. The book begins with a family holiday in Rome, seen through the eyes of three grown-up children whose 'safe world' is about to be torn apart. I felt as though I was peering through a window into what initially seems to be a close-knit family, and then watching the layers of the facade gradually peel away.This book is so relatable, with something for everyone to connect with, whatever their current family situation, from failing relationships and sibling rivalry to parent-child interactions and struggles with parenthood. There's so much bubbling under the surface here, revealing not only how much the characters DO know about each other, but also how much they DON'T, plus all of the secrets they've been trying to hide.A Modern Family is honest and brutal - family life laid bare, down to its deepest foundations. The translation by Rosie Hedger is outstanding and really picks up the subtle nuances of the prose, bringing each character (and the settings) to life.You can't choose your family, but how well do you really know them? How do you know when it's time to make changes or time to move on? And is it ever too late to take the plunge?This book may not provide the answers to these questions, but it will certainly make you think!"},

Now, on the fifteenth anniversary of her sister’s disappearance, the media circus resumes in full flow, and Rosie vows to uncover the truth. But will she find the answer before it tears her family apart?My verdictMy Name is Anna hooked me in straight away with its vivid and evocative writing, as I raced through it late one night into the early hours.It's the story of a little girl who disappears on a family holiday to Florida, told through Anna's eyes and also the eyes of her sister Rosie. Rosie doesn't remember her older sister, but she knows the impact Emily's disappearance had on the family she left behind, even 15 years on - and their parents will never stop searching. Rosie decides it's time for her to do some digging into the past.This book is more than just 'another psychological thriller'. It's a dark, intense and well-plotted exploration of identity, childhood abduction, memories and a mother's love. What if your whole life has been a lie? The ending is fairly abrupt, but it didn't leave me hanging or wanting - just left me imagining what came next and thinking about these characters beyond the final page.My Name is Anna is a thought-provoking read, and not one that's easily forgotten. I look forward to seeing what Lizzy Barber writes next - whatever it is, I'll certainly be putting it at the top of my shopping list!"},
{"title": "The Foundations of the Story by David F. Ross", "date": "Tuesday 26 March 2019", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Welcome to the Heady Heights by David F. Ross. Welcome to the Heady Heights was published in paperback by Orenda Books on 21 March 2019.Welcome to the Heady Heights:The Foundations of the StoryBy David F. Ross01: GlasgowThe city of my birth, and even though I no longer live there I still look on it lovingly from a distance as the greatest city on earth. Admittedly, I haven't been to them all. It wouldn’t matter. The others couldn’t compete. The city is a part of my soul and its restless, grounded creativity has hugely influenced the type of person I am today. The city was going through a period of substantial change in the early 1970s, when The Heady Heights is set. Local Authority policies and indeed, the organisational structures of the Police and the Judiciary were forging new – but not entirely positive – identitities. The East End communities were still suffering from the dislocation caused by the urban clearances of the tenement blocks. Traditional industries such as the Beardmore Steel works which employed thousands of local men were under imminent threat of closure and social deprivation levels were increasing.This context of apparent socio-economic hopelessness in the light of perpetual change drives the principal Glaswegian characters in ‘The Heady Heights’ to try to achieve better lives for themselves. As is perhaps often the case in such circumstances, the grass is rarely as green and attractive as it appears from the other side of a broken-glass-topped brick wall. 02: 19761976 was arguably the best single year in the history of civilisation. Pallid, pasty-faced Glaswegians basked in over forty days of relentless sunshine and ludicrously high temperatures. It was a prolonged ‘taps aff’ vibe that made citizens look up and see parts of the Victorian architecture that they rarely saw when bent over, cowering against the brutal driving rain of a ‘normal’ Scottish summer. Billy Connolly joked that there were only two seasons in Scotland: Winter, and June. Accordingly, our total ignorance of global warming and malignant melanomas made if feel that (a) God was finally smiling on us, so we rejoiced, and our normally blue Scottish skins flaked like never before.In an era before mobile phones and the internet, people like Archie Blunt had a handful of very close mates. They would never let each other get ideas above their station in life. They would call a pal out to his face when he was being an arsehole. Everyone knew where they stood and who they could rely on. Nowadays, people have thousands of ‘virtual’ friends, all air-kissing and ‘gif-ing’ each other like drugged hippies in a worldwide commune … until one makes a too quickly written mis-step, or ‘likes’ a controversial statement, and then its locked in the stocks of a public shaming from which they might never recover. No wonder there is widespread paranoia and mental illness.And then just when we had had enough of middle-of-the-road, self-indulgent prog-rock bollocks (Yes, Freddie Mercury etc…I’m talking about you!), Punk Rock came along and saved us all. Which brings me to…03: The Sex PistolsThe Sex Pistols last-minute appearance on Bill Grundy’s Today show caused the biggest stink in British TV history. It brought punk to the nation and with delicious irony, it was indirectly Freddie Mercury’s fault. Queen had been booked to appear on the live 6pm show, but Mercury developed toothache. It was so bad that Queen’s appearance was cancelled. A desperate EMI offered up their new signings, The Sex Pistols as a last-minute replacement to Today’s producers. What happened next changed everything. When Steve Jones responded to Bill Grundy’s dare that he say “something outrageous” with the words “What a fucking rotter”, he fundamentally altered British broadcasting and took punk into the mainstream. In 1976 you just didn’t hear the word ‘fuck’ on the telly. It had in fact only happened twice before in the history of British TV, and questions were raised in Parliament as a result.In ‘The Heady Heights’, this is a pivotal moment in the story of The High Five. 04: Jim RockfordArchie’s relationship with his father is changing due to his dad’s accelerating dementia. They find a strong connection through favourite TV programmes, and of these, The Rockford Files is the one that provides an anchor for both through the easy assimilation of the two principal characters; Jim Rockford, and his dad, Rocky.My own dad and I also loved The Rockford Files. I suspect my dad looked at James Garner (Jim Rockford) as someone he’d like to be mates with; who’d fit in well in the pubs and the bookies around Shettleston. He was one of his favourite actors.James Garner’s confident affability, his laidback optimism … his gallusness in the face of all threats made him seem more Glaswegian than Californian. His sarcastic wisecracks and crumpled appearance only added to that mystique, and he shuffled through the show like he might realize there were cameras just beyond the fourth wall at any given moment.Incidentally, one of the award-winning writers for The Rockford Files was a young David Chase, who got his big break on the programme and would later go on to create The Sopranos. Even in the mid-70s, The Rockford Files always seemed a cut above the rest.05: Mid-70s light entertainment TVThe Heady Heights is an amalgamation of several shows I grew up watching, involving real people with a (sometimes very well hidden) talent desperately aiming to impress the watching public or a panel of judges sufficiently to be awarded a life-changing opportunity at fame. The more things change, the more they stay the same, eh?When I was younger, we lived across the hall from an actor. He appeared on a Scottish serial drama programme called ‘High Living’. He was the barman; a peripheral and generally non-speaking role. When I saw him on the tenement stairs, if felt like encountering an alien. Nowadays, everyone really ison TV, and sadly for longer than their allocated fifteen minutes.When Archie stumbles inadvertently into a chance opportunity to appear on the national, prime-time Saturday night TV programme, The Heady Heights, it truly does seem unbelievable. But, as he slowly realises that all is not what it might seem with Hank Hendricks and his acolytes, he still can’t reconcile their depravity with the personas of apparently clean-living light entertainment stars. This ‘hiding in plain sight’ now regularly acknowledged about those engaged in such abusive activities remains hard to believe today. 06: Laurel & HardyAll my books (this is now the fourth) have a Laurel & Hardy reference in there somewhere. Although their comedy was born in a different era, it remains timeless to me. It was another thing that connected my dad and I, and since this story is partly a tribute to him and the generation of Glaswegian men that he was part of, a shared love of Stan & Ollie is one of the first things that Archie thinks about when pondering a life without his father in it.If you haven’t yet seen it, Jon S. Baird’s brilliant ‘Stan & Ollie’ movie starring Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly captures their enduring appeal far more eloquently than I ever could. I’d urge you to watch it. 07: The MusicMy books are full of musical references and the culture of the period that they are a central thread of. This is not merely indulgent retro-nostalgia on my part; the attempt is to create an immersive experience for the reader that they can completely lose themselves. The contrasts between humour and pathos, authenticity and absurdity are often finely balanced ones, but the music plays an important part in creating that grounded context of cultural believability. As with my other books, The Heady Heights contains a playlist with the records that appear in the story, or that influenced the vibe*Here’s the link to the songs: https://open.spotify.com/user/dross-gb/playlist/0FyxT1eeHoVGNiXmkZuQnU?si=Gnb0e6HXQcyEj1wE2fRing*Perhaps unfairly, this does not include the 7 minutes of absolute shite more commonly known as Bohemian Rhapsody, despite several mentions of it within the text. Then again, it’s mybook!08: The Central Hotel, GlasgowThe Hotel opened in 1883 and briefly became internationally significant as the destination for the world’s first long distance transmitted television pictures by John Logie Baird in 1927. Sir Winston Churchill and John F Kennedy have been amongst the more recognisable names that have stayed there over the years. Roy Rogers and Trigger are also listed as ‘guests’ although the horse actually stayed at local stables despite the Evening Times reporting otherwise.For most of his adult life, my dad worked in the vast network of tunnels that ran under the railway station. My mum worked in a secretarial office at the back of the hotel overlooking the concourse. They met at a Railwayman’s Dance in the Hotel’s function room on Hogmanay 1960. He was 25; she was 20. They got engaged a year later. Before she died in 1972, I visited her at work on a few occasions and I still recall the labyrinthine nature of the corridors and routes in the building that led to her office and that expansive view of all those Lowry-like people moving purposefully around the station’s famous concourse.In 1973, my dad got trapped in one of the hotel’s antiquated lifts with Ken Dodd. The comedian was staying at the hotel while playing a few nights at the Pavilion. For 38 minutes, Robert Ross was a captive, one-man audience.09: Billy Connolly‘Glasgow’s a bit like Nashville; it doesn’t care much for the living, but it really looks after the dead.’‘When I was a boy I was a Catholic. I paid the fine and got out.’These two brilliant Billy Connolly quotes book-end ‘The Heady Heights’, acknowledging the debt owed to his influence in creating the story and the characters. In the mid-70s, and especially after his first appearance on Parkinson in 1975 – an event he says changed his life completely – Billy Connolly was Glasgow.Billy Connolly is a genius. The greatest comic storyteller I’ve ever heard. I remember listening to records like Cop Yer Whack For This that my dad and his mates loved. Forty years later, thinking about a book that was composed like an elaborate, long-form Connolly story, full of absurd but realistic Glaswegian characters and billowing, achingly funny digressions.In the unlikely event that Sir Billy ever reads ‘The Heady Heights’, I hope he’d recognise some of the descriptions of character and places as authentic to the Glasgow he talked (and still talks) about so warmly.10: My dadThis book is for my dad. He died in 2010, years before my first book was published. He wouldn’t even have been aware that having a novel published was something I’d have been capable of achieving since I never discussed it with him when he was alive.He was born, grew up, and worked in Glasgow his entire life. He was a man symbiotically linked to the city and the close community of friends and workmates he knew. When circumstances intervened and changed the direction of his - and my – life, he always appeared dislocated by it. A fish (that couldnae swim…) out of water. It was perhaps no great surprise that in later life he moved back to the context that he understood so well. Archie’s brief dalliance with fame, and the promise of a different life where he might be able to move on from grief and heartache is the central thread of the book, and perhaps me acknowledging – sadly, too late to tell him – that I finally understand the depth and pain of his personal loss.I hope he would have been pleased with the book, and proud of me for having written it.            About David F RossDavid F.

AUTHORSThis is brutal. Just one? There are so many talented people working in the business today, with such starkly disparate voices, it’s almost impossible to compare them (Megan Abbott versus Lee Child? Linwood Barclay versus Val McDermid?). But if I had to pick one I’d go with a person who, in the last fourteen years, has written one of the most ambitious, sweeping, epic crime stories ever in the trilogy that began with Power of the Dog; and a novel and a prequel (Savages and Kings of Cool) that were almost the exact opposite in both scope (much smaller) and tone (hilariously irreverent); and, just to show even more range, an unforgettable character study about a crooked cop—call it an anti-police procedural—called The Force. That’s why I’ll say the Best of Crime authors working today is . . . Don Winslow.... FILMS/MOVIESWhen I bump across this movie on TV, I can somehow never turn it off, no matter how many times I’ve seen it. Great characters. Gritty setting. Terrific twists. Also, if I could pick one person to narrate the story of my life, it would be Morgan Freeman. That’s why the Best of Crime movie is . . . Shawshank Redemption.... TV DRAMASI was a newspaper reporter in an economically depressed American city for many years. I watched the ravages of the drug trade, and the dysfunction of the institutions that attempted to curtail it. Therefore, pity my wife, with whom I watched the bulk of this five-season classic, because I was constantly pausing it, saying, “No, honey, you don’t understand. That’s actually real! That really happens!” That’s why the Best of Crime TV drama is . . . The Wire.... FICTIONAL KILLERSAs long as we’re talking about The Wire, there’s nothing better than a gay, scar-faced vigilante who only kills drug dealers and walks around in a trench coat, with a shotgun, saying things like, “You come at the king you best not miss.” That’s why the Best of Crime fictional killer is . . . Omar Little.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES You can have all the action heroes you want. I’ll take a guy who tends orchids, almost never leaves his house, and is mostly concerned about what’s for dinner. He weighs a seventh of a ton, so he’s not going to run down any criminals, yet he always seems to get the killer. That’s why the Best of Crime fictional detective is . . . Nero Wolfe.... MURDER WEAPONSAn eleven-inch long twig, made of holly, with a feather at the core. Snaps easily. Doesn’t have a single sharp edge. Couldn’t shoot a bullet if it wanted to. And yet it takes down the most notorious badass off all-time with a simple disarming spell. That’s why the Best of Crime murder weapon is . . . Harry Potter’s wand.    ... DEATH SCENESIt’s difficult to talk about this scene without spoiling, y’know, the entire book. I’ll just say it is jaw-dropping, gut-wrenching, utterly shocking and yet—when you go back over everything in your mind—also completely justified. That’s why the Best of Crime death scene can be found on the final page of  . . . Defending Jacob.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI have to be honest, I’m pretty lazy as a writer. I go for ease every time. And I don’t really remember how I researched anything before this ingenious little algorithm came along. That’s why the Best of Crime website is . . . www.Google.com....

Their books are gripping, taut, and very, very French. I don’t think they’re celebrated enough.... FILMS/MOVIESI adore the original Their Secret in their Eyes. It’s got everything I need from a thriller, with a gut-punch ending and impossibly tense sequences– but it’s also a fascinating commentary on storytelling and the history of Argentina. I love it to pieces.... TV DRAMASMy current obsession is with Dark. I used to hesitate to recommend it to thriller fans because of the time-travel element. But now that the world has fallen for The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle I’m not holding back! It’s like the plot of The Missing got hold of Hermione’s time-turner, and, like the title suggests, it’s about as moody as a dozen Scandinavian box sets. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHis Bloody Project comes to mind. When the book came out, there was this buzz over the fact that a thriller was on the Man Booker Longlist. Now that that whole thing has blown over, we really need to get back to talking about how great this book is! It’s all from the point of view of a teenage crofter called Roderick Macrae, and how his frustrations with his community leads him to murder. I’d never read about a character like him. In fact, I didn’t have a clue about what a crofter was! He’s a violent, hideous character, but he reveals so much about his community that I couldn’t stop reading about him.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES For a brief period of my life, I lived in Bangkok. It’s a mad city, and I was overwhelmed by it for a very long time. It was Sonchai Jitpleecheep, the detective in John Burdett’s Bangkok Eight series, who helped me make sense of it all. He’s an outsider due to his mixed race, but he still knows his city inside out, and his Thai Buddhist beliefs also gives him a different feel to the typical run-of-the-mill detective archetype.... MURDER WEAPONSIt always tickles me to think that when Edgar Allan Poe wrote The Murders at the Rue Morgue, he managed to invent the detective story with an utterly deranged plot which no modern editor would accept even for a second. Who could have thought that a story of a death-by-orangutan-stuffing-you-up-a-chimney would have such a profound influence on culture? ... DEATH SCENESWhenever I travel, I like to read a detective story set in the local area: it’s such a good way to get the feel of a place. So when I went to Rio, I picked up Silence of the Rain. To be honest, I don’t actually remember much about the plot, and I don’t think I learnt much about the city. But the absolutely astonishing, out-of-nowhere death-by-sex-asphyxiation scene has definitely stayed with me.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESIt entirely depends on the project. For The Bridal Party, I had to immerse myself in folklore, so there were many hours spent on Folklore Thursday. The only problem is that there’s so much cool stuff on there that hours would pass by without a single word being written.... WRITING TIPSI maintain that the best way to improve is to join a writing group - they’ll give you all the tips to accept and ignore that you’ll ever need. In terms of thriller writing, I will add this, however: words that write themselves read themselves. If you’re in a flow, trust it. You may not end up with a workable draft, but there’s always something compulsive and enjoyable in what you write when the story grabs hold of you.... WRITING SNACKSI mean, yoghurt exists. So do nuts and berries and quinoa-salad-smoothie-quiches (probably).

{"title": "The Taking of Annie Thorne by CJ Tudor", "date": "Thursday 14 March 2019", "text": "The Taking of Annie ThorneBy CJ TudorPublished by Michael Joseph (21 February 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher Publisher's descriptionThen...One night, Annie went missing. Disappeared from her own bed. There were searches, appeals. Everyone thought the worst. And then, miraculously, after forty-eight hours, she came back. But she couldn't, or wouldn't, say what had happened to her.Something happened to my sister. I can't explain what. I just know that when she came back, she wasn't the same. She wasn't my Annie. I didn't want to admit, even to myself, that sometimes I was scared to death of my own little sister.Now... The email arrived in my inbox two months ago. I almost deleted it straight away, but then I clicked OPEN: I know what happened to your sister. It's happening again...My verdictThe Taking of Annie Thorne is creepy crime fiction at its best, from its compelling characters and strong sense of place to its fast-moving plot and action-packed ending.Centred around a small mining village, the book is chilling from the outset, told through the mesmerising and often humorous voice of teacher Joe Thorne, who has returned to the place of his childhood. His little sister, Annie, disappeared for 48 hours when she was eight and was never the same again.Joe is flawed and unreliable with an underlying vulnerability, haunted by memories of his dead sister and a creepy doll called 'Abbie Eyes'. The book swings between his past and present, as old mistakes, teenage rebellion and unfinished business gradually bubble to the surface.The Taking of Annie Thorne is dark, shocking, atmospheric and entertaining, filled with elements of supernatural, horror and psychological thrillers. This is a book you'll want to keep reading well into the early hours - though that may not be advisable if you ever want to sleep again!It made me nostalgic for my teenage years, when I was addicted to Stephen King and James Herbert books. And very soon, I'll be re-reading those books again.Looking forward to seeing what's next from CJ Tudor.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "The Neighbour by Fiona Cummins", "date": "Wednesday 13 March 2019", "text": "The Neighbour By Fiona CumminsPublished by Pan Macmillan (4 April 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionFOR SALE: A lovely family home with good-sized garden and treehouse occupying a plot close to woodland. Perfect for kids, fitness enthusiasts, dog walkers . . .And, it seems, the perfect hunting ground for a serial killer.On a hot July day, Garrick and Olivia Lockwood and their two children move into 25 The Avenue looking for a fresh start. They arrive in the midst of a media frenzy: they’d heard about the local murders in the press, but Garrick was certain the killer would be caught and it would all be over in no time. Besides, they’d got the house at a steal and he was convinced he could flip it for a fortune.The neighbours seemed to be the very picture of community spirit. But everyone has secrets, and the residents in The Avenue are no exception.After six months on the case with no real leads, the most recent murder has turned DC Wildeve Stanton’s life upside down, and now she has her own motive for hunting down the killer – quickly.My verdictThe Neighbour is creepy and twisty, gripping and shocking - exactly as I would expect from author Fiona Cummins, having read and loved her two previous books, Rattle and The Collector.The Neighbour is yet another serial killer thriller but this time a standalone. It focuses on one particular suburban street, with its eclectic array of residents, all seemingly hiding secrets and 'not-so-perfect' lives behind their closed doors. And then there's the body count ... which keeps rising.Short snappy 'just one more' chapters keep the story moving at a cracking pace, with plenty of new revelations to add to the intrigue. Fiona Cummins writes beautiful prose with some gruesome descriptions, and certainly manages to get right inside the minds of all of her characters - good or bad! There's a strong sense of unease throughout the book.Just like the serial killer, I felt that I was snooping on these households. The Neighbour reminded me of a theatrical production, with each character getting their time in the spotlight. Keep an eye on the chapter headings, as these indicate which neighbour or neighbours are currently taking centre stage.The Neighbour is certainly a chilling read and one that made me think about the claustrophobic nature of suburban life and how easy it is to know very little about the people around us. I don't think I'll trust my own neighbours ever again!"},
{"title": "My Emotional History Lesson with The Courier ", "date": "Tuesday 5 March 2019", "text": "Today, I'm on the Blog Tour for The Courier by Kjell Ola Dahl, which is being published in paperback by Orenda Books on 21 March 2019. (E-book already available.) If you haven't already bought The Courier, I highly recommend it (you can read my full review at the end of this post). Rather than republish my review on its own, I thought I would research some background facts. I certainly wasn't intending to turn this into an emotional history lesson - read on to discover more.  I love it when crime novels or thrillers leave me wanting to know more. I don't mean in terms of plot but, instead, I mean in terms of my own knowledge. The Courier is set in Norway in 1942, 1967 and 2015. After reading the book, I realised I knew very little about the Jews living there during the Nazi invasion.I wrote this in my original review:\"The book is steeped in history - Norway in World War 2 and the plight of its Jewish people during the Holocaust - with roots in espionage and wartime resistance. Its female protagonist, Ester, is strong and courageous, highlighting the importance of women during the war and how they risked their lives. I was fascinated by the social and political background, knowing very little about the Nazi invasion of Norway during World War 2. I found myself Googling snippets of information as I read the book - and now I've finished I want to know more!\"So I did go in search of more ... But where did I go and what did I find?I actually found a lot more than I expected!I thought I would find some facts about Norway during the Holocaust and the fate of the Jews there. Rather than rely on Wikipedia (as many people do), I found myself on the Yad Vashem website. For those who don't know, Yad Vashem is the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, Israel - the best place to go to for information on the Holocaust, with its testimonials, Hall of Names memorial and digital collections, and its fascinating (and heart-wrenching) Holocaust History Museum.Here are five facts I found Germany invaded Norway on 9th April 1940. At that time, there were about 1,700 Jews living in Norway, including around 200 Jewish refugees from Central Europe. Most of Norway's Jews lived in the capital, Oslo, and about 300 lived in the city of Trondheim. (Source 1)By early 1942, Jewish identity papers had to be stamped with the word \"Jew.\" (Source 1)During the Holocaust, 763 Norwegian Jews were sent to the death camps. Of these, 739 were murdered, mainly in Auschwitz. Another 23 Norwegian Jews were killed in Norway by the Nazis. And around 900 Jews escaped to Sweden, with the help of the Norwegian Underground. (Source 2)More than 5,000 non-Jewish Norwegians were also deported to concentration camps; 649 of these died there. (Source 1)The Germans gave up their control over Norway in May 1945. (Source 1)Original sources are at the end.Norwegian victims of AuschwitzUnable to stop there, I carried on my search. Through Yad Vashem, I found a list of Holocaust victims (men, women and children) living in Norway who were then deported to Auschwitz and died there. If you want more details, the link is here. The information in the list is still lacking in many places, and will probably never be known. But in summary, the youngest was aged one year and the oldest was aged 75. I was astonished to discover that this list includes Jacob/Jakob Caplan/Kaplan and Solly Caplan/Kaplan from Manchester, England. It made me wonder about their stories. Were they brothers or maybe father and son? Jacob/Jakob was born in 1903 so would have been around 40 when he died, but there's no date of birth for Solly and there's no date of death for either of them. How did they end up in Norway and then in Auschwitz? If they had remained in England, they would never had died in the camps.I mentioned this to Steph Rothwell (Steph's Book Blog) and she searched the Lancashire birth records - there are several Jacob and Solomon Caplans born between 1900 and 1910 in the Cheetham subdistrict.Then my husband (a genealogy whizz) showed me how to access the Yad Vashem Pages of Testimony and I now know more about the brothers Jacob & Solly Caplan. These Pages of Testimony was submitted to Yad Vashem by Jacob's son in 1978:Information (in Hebrew) was also submitted by their aunt, Malka Klein Gotfrid.Remembering Holocaust victimsFinally, I want to mention a bittersweet burial and memorial ceremony I went to in January 2019 - one of the most emotional services I have ever been to and history in the making. It was for six unknown Jewish Holocaust victims, whose remains had been stored at the Imperial War Museum in London for twenty years, donated by an unnamed person, believed to be a survivor. We know nothing about these victims - their ages, places of birth or dates of death. But it IS known (thanks to forensic techniques) that these were five adults and one child. And we also know that they were all murdered at Auschwitz simply because they were Jewish. The remains were finally given a Jewish burial and a final resting place in Bushey New (Jewish) Cemetery.As we stood outside in bitter temperatures, with ice and snow covering the ground, we couldn't even imagine what it would have been like for starving Holocaust victims in the camps, with their flimsy clothes. These six victims represent the six million Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust and who have no grave for their families to visit. Fifty Holocaust survivors attended the burial and memorial service, many of them wondering whether any of these victims were from their own families.It's possible that one (or more) of them could have even come from Norway.We will never know. The Courier by Kjell Ola DahlThe rest of my reviewPublisher's descriptionIn 1942, Jewish courier Ester is betrayed, narrowly avoiding arrest by the Gestapo. In a great haste, she escapes to Sweden, saving herself. Her family in Oslo, however, is deported to Auschwitz. In Stockholm, Ester meets the resistance hero, Gerhard Falkum, who has left his little daughter and fled both the Germans and allegations that he murdered his wife, Åse, who helped Ester get to Sweden. Their burgeoning relationship ends abruptly when Falkum dies in a fire.And yet, twenty-five years later, Falkum shows up in Oslo. He wants to reconnect with his daughter. But where has he been, and what is the real reason for his return? Ester stumbles across information that forces her to look closely at her past, and to revisit her war-time training to stay alive…My verdictThe Courier is a literary spy thriller, perfect for John Le Carré fans, and a very welcome addition to the Nordic Noir genre.The book features a tightly threaded plot and convincing characterisation, so it didn't take long to worm its way under my skin. I was soon caught up in the lives of Ester, Gerhard, Sverre, Åsa and Turid. There's a sense of unease throughout the book, as Ester seeks answers to how her friend Åsa died. I was holding my breath in several gripping moments as she, Sverre and Gerhard played their cat-and-mouse games. I had no idea who to trust and who to believe, right until the final scenes.The narrative switches seamlessly between Oslo and Stockholm in 1942 and Oslo in 1967 and 2015. Each chapter is clearly marked with the year and location so the multiple timelines were very easy to follow.  The writing is excellent (translated by Don Bartlett) - sparse where it needs to be, to move the story along at a fast pace, but highly descriptive elsewhere, with acute observations that paint a vivid picture of people and places.So much tension bubbles away under the surface. But this is far more than just a thriller and a murder mystery. It's also a heartbreaking read, as Ester learns more about what happened to her family and her childhood friend. The ending brought tears to my eyes but also a strong sense of resolution.Highly recommended!Sources1. Norway. Shoah Resource Center.

AUTHORSAn emphasis on quality over quantity may account for Kent Anderson not being better known. His first novel, Sympathy for the Devilwas published in 1987, but the nearly decade-long gap between that and his follow-up, Night Dogs(1996), feels like a mere interlude given the further 22 years it took for Green Sunto complete his trilogy about soldier-turned-cop-turned-professor-turned-cop Hanson in 2018. The books trace Hanson from the killing fields of Vietnam, to his stint as a beat cop in Portland, to his return to uniform riding solo through the streets of 80s Oakland, and in doing so follow in Anderson's own footsteps. An intense, poetic, and sometimes hallucinatory tale of a man trying to form some kind of moral order from the violence both he and the world have wrought. Barry Gornell has written two very perfect, very gothic Highland noirs. Wealthy incomers from the city disrupt the simple routines of a rural loner, stirring up past and future tensions in The Healing of Luther Grove, and The Wrong Childexplores the savage consequences in a small village of a disaster that killed 21 school children, leaving a sole survivor. I read somewhere that he was doing for the Highlands what Daniel Woodrell does for the Ozarks, which seems about right. Outlaw fiction at its best.... FILMS/MOVIESI'm always snoring on to people about Night Moves, one of the great revisionist noirs of 70s Hollywood. Directed by Arthur Penn, off the back of Bonnie and Clydeand Little Big Man, it was scripted by Scottish novelist-turned-screenwriter Alan Sharp, whose work in that period stands up to anyone's (The Hired Hand,Ulzana's Raid, Billy Two Hats, etc). Gene Hackman, ex-footballer P.I. escapes his troubled marriage by taking a job looking for a missing girl (the first major role for a young Melanie Griffiths), but the case sprawls and he quickly loses his grip on it and never really regains it. Classic inquiry into the post-Watergate American psyche. The Reckoning sports an exhilarating turn by Nicol Williamson as a working class boy done good in a big company in London, who returns home to Liverpool when his father dies. Discovering there is more to the death than he was initially told, he goes looking for revenge, threatening his future in the company and his relationship with his well-born wife. It's a similar premise to Get Carter, but predates both that film and the Ted Lewis novel is was adapted from. ... TV DRAMASBeing too young to see the work of Dennis Potter or Alan Clarke on the BBC first time round, watching Homicide: Life on the Street as a teenager was the first time I realised what the form was capable of, that it didn’t have to be the smaller brother to cinema. In the early seasons, each episode felt like a short play, less concerned with the solving of crimes than it was with exploring existentially what it meant to be murder police in a city like Baltimore (the show was based on a true crime book by David Simon, who produced its later seasons and went on to create The Wire). Bob Peck's grief-torn Ronald Craven in Edge of Darkness, a policeman who witnesses his daughter brutally shot-gunned before his eyes and then rushes headlong into a reckless investigation of her death, is a searing and idiosyncratic creation. He brushes up against the sharp edges of Thatcherite Britain - secret services, the nuclear military-industrial complex, his own murky history in Northern Ireland, and even guilt-shaped hallucinations of his eco-daughter - on his way to a climax that is both melancholy and restorative. Troy Kennedy Martin said he had written a story about a detective who turned into a tree. Why wouldn't you want to see that?... FICTIONAL KILLERSJean-Patrick Manchette said, “the mystery novel is the great moral literature of our era,” and Aimée Joubert was the great avenging angel of his own literature; a Marxist terrorist-cum-contract-killer who stalks France’s ruling classes through the pages of Fatale, using their wealth to turn them against one another and put them on track to a climactic bloodbath. As Manchette said of his own writing: “Attack! Attack! Time is running short!” ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES There are so many great detectives who I could drone on about for hours, but I’m particularly partial to Frank Marker. Across the seven series of ITV’s Public Eye, Frank (played by Alfred Burke) plied his trade in London, Birmingham, Brighton, Windsor, and Chertsey. He worked out of small, grubby shopfronts, and lived in bed-sits or lodging rooms. He never worked big cases, and half the time never brought the mundane inquiries he did make to any satisfying conclusion. He went after and missed his big score on several occasions, did a spell inside after working with a dodgy solicitor, and seldom maintained any lasting relationships, with friends or lovers. He was the epitome of small-time struggle, and that’s why he’s so fascinating.   ... MURDER WEAPONSIn 1599, the corrupt governor of Macas, a small Spanish settlement in Ecuador, decided to tax his native subjects, ostensibly claiming the gold was needed to celebrate the coronation of the new Spanish king, Philip III. The Jivaro people, unhappy with the arrangement, collected all the gold they could and waited for the governor to visit the mining town of Logroño. There, the Jivaro attacked, killing all the men, capturing the women, and imprisoning the governor. They stripped him naked in the town square and set up a large forge to melt all the gold. Forcing the governor’s mouth open with a bone, they poured the liquid gold down his throat, the steam from which burst his lungs and bowels before the gold congealed again, blocking up his insides.It’s an idea that’s going to fester in Boone’s mind…     ... DEATH SCENESNewton Thornburg’s Cutter and Bone has one of those endings that makes you whisper, “Oh shit,” to yourself, and immediately read it again to make sure it really happened. It’s not just the broad scope of what happens that makes it so darkly brilliant, but the way Thornburg wrote it, right down to the most perfect of final sentences. Inexplicably, almost all of Thornburg’s novels have remained out of print in America since their initial runs in the 70s and 80s. Serpent’s Tail reissued three of them as part of their Midnight Classics range at the turn of the millennium, copies of which can usually be found 2nd hand, but they do offer most of his major works in digital editions.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI find maps an invaluable resource, and the National Libraries of Scotland offer a vast range of maps for free online, including a good selection of OS sheets up to 1960. Their website is excellently constructed so you can match their map sheets with google maps, either overlaid or side-by-side and locked-in. https://maps.nls.uk/index.html... WRITING TIPSDon’t be afraid of being shit. First drafts aren’t final drafts, so if they’re dreadful it doesn’t matter—this is the beginning of a process. The only page of writing that can’t be fixed is a blank one. Let the crap spew forth. ... WRITING SNACKSTea. I like a strong breakfast tea first thing, and a mellower blend of an afternoon.

{"title": "Three Hours by Rosamund Lupton - very early review", "date": "Monday 4 March 2019", "text": "Three HoursBy Rosamund LuptonPublished by Penguin Books UK (17 October 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalleyI don't usually read and review books this early, but I was told that I MUST read this one by another reviewer (Liz Barnsley of Liz Loves Books) - as it was well worth doing so. I also don't usually read books in one sitting like this, so I have to get my thoughts out of my system now! Apologies for such an early (but spoiler-free) review.Publisher's descriptionIn a rural English village in the middle of a snowstorm, the unthinkable happens: the school is under siege.From the wounded headmaster barricaded in the library, to teenage Hannah in love for the first time, to the pregnant police psychologist who must identify the gunmen...My verdictIronically it took me around three hours to read Three Hours. For most of that time, my heart was pounding with a strong sense of fear and dread, my throat tight, my jaw tense. I barely took a breath, occasionally coming up for air. This is a race against the clock – and in various places I wished that I could press a pause button to give the characters extra time.The writing moves at a cracking pace, switching from person to person, then back again, with some expertly woven twists – so cleverly structured. Afterwards, I couldn’t stop thinking about all the little things that now made sense and slotted into place, that I’d blinked over when I’d read them the first time.I felt as though as I was there alongside the characters, as if they were my own friends and family – all of it feeling so real and close to home. Yes, the plotting is incredible but it’s the writing that wowed me in particular and wormed its way under my skin.While there’s a mystery at the heart of the book – who are these gunmen and why are they targeting this remote school in Somerset? – for me, the book was an emotional rollercoaster from beginning to end, fuelled by its human element and exploration of human nature. What drives us to perform immense acts of violence and also immense acts of love? Three Hours was a traumatic reading experience in many ways – it challenged me, thrilled me, stunned me and upset me - but I am so glad that I immersed myself within its pages. In several places, I had to pause and take a breath – scared to read on, yet scared not to. My youngest teen came into the room at one point while I was reading and I just wanted to pull him close and hug him, never let him go. This book made me worry about my teenagers, about sending them to school the next day, about the future of society. Yet it also gave me a sense of hope.Three Hours is a thriller about ordinary people doing what’s right, going above and beyond their natural capabilities and comfort zone. It’s a message about society and vulnerability, love and the importance of community. This will be one of my top reads of 2019.If Only I could Tell youBy Hannah BeckermanPublished by Orion (21 February 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionAudrey's family has fallen apart. Her two grown-up daughters, Jess and Lily, are estranged, and her two teenage granddaughters have never been allowed to meet. A secret that echoes back thirty years has splintered the family in two, but is also the one thing keeping them connected. As tensions reach breaking point, the irrevocable choice that one of them made all those years ago is about to surface. After years of secrets and silence, how can one broken family find their way back to each other?My verdictIf Only I Could Tell You is a moving story of a family torn apart by secrets, grief and loss.Audrey wishes she could reunite her daughters Jess and Lily after 30 years of estrangement - in doing so, she would also enable her two teenage granddaughters to be part of each other's lives. But some wounds are embedded so deeply that they seem impossible to mend. Now the clock is ticking, is it possible for them all to move onwards, forwards and upwards?If Only I Could Tell You is cleverly plotted, with a mystery at its heart - what caused Jess and Lily to fall out those years ago? It switches seamlessly from past to present, and back again, as secrets are unlocked and emotions are laid bare. This is a story about sisters, mothers and daughters, fathers and daughters, and tragic secrets that can bring families together but also rip them to shreds.There was a game-changer around halfway through the book, which floored me and then put everything else into perspective, switching my views on the different characters and the parts they played. By the time the truth was there, I had tears rolling down my cheeks.This book is an ideal choice for a book club or reading group. It's heartbreaking, poignant and uplifting, and raises many moral questions about serious issues by the end - perfect for discussions.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Museums and libraries burning. Digital records and irreplaceable proofs, lost for ever.Former White House operative Maggie Costello has sworn off politics. But when the Governor of Virginia seeks her help to stop the lethal spiral of killings, she knows that this is bigger than any political game. As Black Lives Matter protestors clash with slavery deniers, America is on a knife-edge and time is running out. This deadly conspiracy could ignite a new Civil War - but who stands to gain most from the chaos?My verdictTo Kill the Truth is certainly a thriller of the modern world. With clear roots in the David Irving trial, the book is filled with twists and turns, politics, technological warfare, fake news, racism/antisemitism and holocaust denial. It's a follow up to last year's To Kill the President (which I admit I haven't read), with a focus on pace and thrills to provide a high-octane rollercoaster read.To book a ticket for Jonathan Freedland (Sam Bourne)'s Jewish Book Week event, click here.The Courier by Kjell Ola DahlPublished in paperback by Orenda Books in March 2019 (ebook out now)Publisher's descriptionIn 1942, Jewish courier Ester is betrayed, narrowly avoiding arrest by the Gestapo. In a great haste, she escapes to Sweden, saving herself. Her family in Oslo, however, is deported to Auschwitz. In Stockholm, Ester meets the resistance hero, Gerhard Falkum, who has left his little daughter and fled both the Germans and allegations that he murdered his wife, Åse, who helped Ester get to Sweden. Their burgeoning relationship ends abruptly when Falkum dies in a fire.And yet, twenty-five years later, Falkum shows up in Oslo. He wants to reconnect with his daughter. But where has he been, and what is the real reason for his return? Ester stumbles across information that forces her to look closely at her past, and to revisit her war-time training to stay alive…My verdictThe Courier is a literary spy thriller, perfect for John Le Carré fans, and a very welcome addition to the Nordic Noir genre ... So much tension bubbles away under the surface. But this is far more than just a thriller and a murder mystery. It's also a heartbreaking read, as Ester learns more about what happened to her family and her childhood friend. The ending brought tears to my eyes but also a strong sense of resolution.

Nothing is out of place in her ordered life…Then she met someone who she was never supposed to speak to. And he introduced her to a whole world of new lists:New foods to try – oysters and sushiGreat movies to watch – Bambi and Some Like It Hot Things I love about Eliza BloomEliza left everything she knew behind for him, but sometimes love just isn’t enough. Especially when he opens a hidden shoebox and starts asking a lot of questions about her past life. As the walls Eliza has carefully constructed threaten to come crashing down, will she find a way to keep hold of everyone she loves, and maybe, just maybe, bring the two sides of her heart together at last?My verdictThe Two Hearts of Eliza Bloom is a story of identity, love, choice and family. Eliza (or Aliza) Bloom runs away from her religious Jewish life to marry Alex, a non-Jewish man. Years later, her teenage daughter unlocks family secrets to reveal that moving on (and leaving the past behind) wasn't so straightforward after all. Eliza breaks the taboos and traditions of her religion to try new foods and new experiences, determined to please her new husband (who wants to introduce her to the 'wonders' of the 'real world'). This provides a good introduction to Orthodox Judaism (especially the more religious communities) for those who know little about it. It isn't always easy reading though, as Eliza struggles with her new identity and is torn between her old life (love for Judaism and her family, especially her grandfather, Zaida) and her new life (love for Alex and the excitement he provides). Some of her 'new experiences' did make me cringe, having been brought up with many of the Jewish traditions myself. This is an easy read, with a well-rounded mix of laughs, sensitivity and sadness. The book also raises interesting questions though, such as 'Is the grass always greener?' and 'Is it wise to make spur-of-the-moment life-changing decisions without knowing the full facts?'So that's it for now! But I have many more Jewish-themed books on my list and will reading (and reviewing) them over the coming months. So do pop back to Off-the-Shelf Books for more updates!"},

AUTHORSIt’s difficult to choose one and it probably changes with different books that I read, but I have to say at the moment it’s Lisa Jewell, her book Watching You was impossible to put down.... FILMS/MOVIESI recently watched Red Sparrow and loved Jennifer Lawrence’s character Dominika and how she paid back all those who’d used her so badly. I love watching a bit of inspired revenge being played out.... TV DRAMASBreaking Bad. My son wanted me to watch it and I really didn’t think that it was my thing. One weekend he went away and left the first DVD series in front of my TV and I only began watching it so that I could honestly say I’d tried. But I was instantly hooked, and binge watched for 8 hours on some days. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSVillanelle from Killing Eve. I loved the calm way she killed people without any regret, they were simply contracts she had agreed to fulfill, as well as the ingenious ways she murdered each victim.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I have to say Hercule Poirot. I love the period, settings - which is probably why I ended up using an art deco house for My Last Lie – and his deductions. What’s not to love? ... MURDER WEAPONSA daffodil bulb (Narcissus). The bulb looks similar an onion and apparently two of them cooked and served with a meal would be lethal to an adult.    ... DEATH SCENESThe most shocking death scene that I still haven’t recovered from has to be the death of Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. Why did they do that to him? Why?  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESIt depends what I’m looking for to substantiate a plot thread that I want to include. But I don’t have a dedicated set of websites that I visit. For My Last Lie I’ve looked up anything from house plans for art deco houses of the twenties to ensure I have the right layout for the home in this book, The Briars. I’ve also looked up estate agency websites for photos of the insides of houses that might inspire something in my story. ... WRITING TIPSAllow yourself thinking time. It helps unravel plot twists. I also write an outline, not in detail, but one that reminds me where I intended going with the story. The story might change as I get to know the characters, or come up with a better plot twist, but an outline helps keep me going with the first draft....

{"title": "The Ringmaster by Vanda Symon", "date": "Friday 22 February 2019", "text": "The RingmasterBy Vanda SymonPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 18 February 2019; Paperback - 18 April 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionDeath is stalking the southern South Island of New Zealand...Marginalised by previous antics, Sam Shephard, is on the bottom rung of detective training in Dunedin, and her boss makes sure she knows it. She gets involved in her first homicide investigation, when a university student is murdered in the Botanic Gardens, and Sam soon discovers this is not an isolated incident. There is a chilling prospect of a predator loose in Dunedin, and a very strong possibility that the deaths are linked to a visiting circus…Determined to find out who’s running the show, and to prove herself, Sam throws herself into an investigation that can have only one ending…My verdictI adored this book so much - it made me laugh, cry, grimace and cheer. The Ringmaster is the second book in this crime fiction series set in New Zealand. The writing is fabulous and, as with the previous book, Overkill, I was drawn straight into the story by the chilling prologue.Vanda Symon writes with a distinctive style, with acute observations, vivid imagery, sharp witty dialogue and plenty of humour. I actually laughed all the way through the book - other than one scene that made me cry, but more on that shortly. Some crime novels could be set anywhere in the world, but The Ringmaster definitely brings the New Zealand setting to life. I found myself Googling locations, towns and even plant life, so that I could picture them as I read onwards.Sam Shephard is a brilliant character and highly likeable. She's headstrong and determined and doesn't always do what she's told, which has a habit of getting her into trouble - especially in The Ringmaster, as her boss is giving her a very hard time. Sam is very 'normal' and, while she's far from perfect, she doesn't have any of the hang-ups often found in crime fiction protagonists. I love her friendship with her best friend, Maggie, which lightens up the darkness of the plot, and also her relationship with her parents and colleagues.Not only are all of the characters in the book well rounded but they are also brilliantly described (both humans and animals). They all feel very real - I know this is the case due to the scene mentioned above that not only had me on the edge of my seat but also triggered tears.In summary, The Ringmaster wowed me with its twisty journey, weaving various threads together, right through the shocking, and surprising, ending. This gripping series is a definite 'must read' for me - and anyone else who loves entertaining, humorous crime fiction with plenty of heart."},
{"title": "Aftershock by Adam Hamdy", "date": "Friday 22 February 2019", "text": "AftershockBy Adam HamdyPublished by Headline (E-book & Hardback - out now; Paperback - 21 March 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionTHEY BELIEVED IT WAS OVERHaving survived the lethal Pendulum conspiracy, photographer John Wallace atones for his past mistakes.DI Patrick Bailey clings to the hope that he can, at last, return to a normal life in London. BUT IT'S ONLY JUST BEGINNINGFBI investigator Christine Ash - alone and paranoid - hunts down the remaining members of the ruthless Foundation organisation.DARK FORCES ARE RISING AGAINBut when masked assassins strike at the heart of the UK government, a shocking new threat emerges that forces all three to reunite.DEADLIER THAN EVER BEFOREWith time running out, they must defeat a lethal new adversary: a manipulative mastermind with sinister powers unlike anything they've seen before. My verdictWow, what a rollercoaster ride that was. I don't think the action stopped from beginning to end!Aftershock is the third in a series. My advice is to read it after you've read the other two (Pendulum and Freefall). You really do need to understand the back story to get the most out of it.Now about the book itself ...As I've written above, the action doesn't stop and I felt quite exhausted by the end (in a good way)! Yet despite being an action-packed thriller, Aftershock is also a character-led story. Poor Ash, Wallace and Bailey - constantly in the firing line as the Foundation organisation attempts to hunt them down, and also battling with their inner demons, as the cat-and-mouse chase becomes increasingly personal.The Pendulum series is well written and intelligently and cleverly plotted. It's entertaining (maybe far-fetched in places) but also a thought-provoking look at society, technology, government and the law.I'm interested to see what's next for Adam Hamdy."},
{"title": "Author in the Spotlight - Kate Rhodes ", "date": "Thursday 21 February 2019", "text": "It's been over two years since my last Author in the Spotlight feature. Today, I am delighted that KATE RHODES is taking part (and apologies to Kate for what became known as 'Vicki's Killer Question'). Ruin Beach is published in paperback by Simon & Schuster today (21 February 2019). Your Alice Quentin series is set in London. What prompted the switch to the Isles of Scilly for your new Ben Kitto series? London is my home town, so it was ideal territory for my first crime stories. I loved writing about such a huge, complex city, but felt tempted to try something different for my new series. I still wanted to set my books in a place I knew intimately and the Isles of Scilly were a logical choice. I’ve loved visiting them since my childhood. They seemed like the ideal place for a series of ‘closed room’ mysteries. The five inhabited islands lie in the Atlantic, west of Land’s End and haven’t featured in a crime series before. Bryher, St Agnes, Tresco and St Martin’s all have less than 200 permanent inhabitants, making them great terrain for crime stories that would rip a close community apart.Community dynamic within a remote setting is very important in this new series - how did you make it feel so authentic? Experience or research, or both?That’s a lovely compliment, thank you! Yearly holidays on the islands throughout my childhood helped a lot with authenticity. The islanders are also very friendly and inclusive towards visitors. I spent a month on the islands during 2012 and asked lots of questions, which people seemed happy to answer. I feel like I have committed the islands’ geography to memory after such a long stay, which was a bonus when plotting each book.You began your writing life as a poet, which is why your novels are so beautifully written and also why your writing has lyrical rhythm. Why did you choose to write crime fiction?I could be cynical and say that I wanted to pay my mortgage, because so few people buy poetry these days, but the truth is more complex. I loved reading crime from the age of twelve upwards, starting with Agatha Christie and then moving on to American noir. I think that great crime novels have all the style and precision of poetry, and it always thrills me when readers say they enjoy the flow of my prose.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I write a one or two page synopsis and numerous character outlines before embarking, but sometimes things change radically. Characters can push themselves into the foreground unexpectedly, or I suddenly see a better twist and everything has to change. I can get bored if I nail everything down too tightly. A loose plan works best for me. So long as I know the beginning, the crisis, and the ending when I set off, everything usually works out fine.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less? Clear and simple, with occasional outbreaks of poetry.Do you have any strange writing habits? Too many to mention! I rarely start writing until the afternoon. My brain takes a long time to warm up, so I’ll procrastinate for as long as possible by doing the laundry, going to the supermarket, or taking a walk. I usually begin writing straight after lunch, then work solidly for five or six hours.If you were writing a book about your life, what would the title be? (AKA 'Vicki's Killer Question')A Life of Crime and Lucky Breaks by a South London Girl.What advice would you give your younger self?Have more confidence. I think that 90% of writing is having the nerve to tell your tale. I waited until I was 38 before giving serious writing a try, too terrified to take the plunge.  What advice do you have for aspiring authors?Try to carve out a few regular time slots each week, so you get space to write. If you can join a writing group, or go on a course, that will help you develop your ideas. Also, don’t be afraid to take a few risks. It will help you enormously if you can make your book just a little bit different from what’s already available.And lastly, why should people read Ruin Beach (and Hell Bay)?If you enjoy crime novels set on tiny, remote islands, these books are for you. They’re also going to appeal to anyone who loves Cornwall’s dramatic scenery. The series has been optioned for TV, so if you read them now, you’ll be able to see how the production outfit that brought us The Fall and The Line of Duty interpret them on the small screen.About Kate RhodesKate Rhodes grew up in Greenwich, in South London.  Her first job was as an usherette at a London theatre, where she dreamed of becoming an actor and had the luxury of watching hundreds of plays without having to pay for a ticket. She studied in the UK and in Texas, completing a PhD then becoming an English teacher. Before her career as a crime writer began, Kate wrote two award-winning collections of poetry. Kate's favourite hobby is travelling with her husband Dave, an artist and short story writer. She lives in Cambridge, where she enjoys a view from her office of cows roaming across Stourbridge Common, and enjoys regular visits from her three grown-up step-sons. Kate is one of the original members of the influential crime writing group, Killer Women.

As the islands’ lazy summer takes hold, he finds himself missing the excitement of the murder squad in London. But when the body of professional diver Jude Trellon is discovered, anchored to the rocks of a nearby cave, his investigative skills are once again needed.At first it appears that the young woman’s death was a tragic accident, but when evidence suggests otherwise, the islanders close ranks. With even those closest to the victim refusing to talk, it seems that plenty of islanders had reason to harm her. As the community remains guarded, Ben Kitto discovers that terrible secrets lie beneath the waters around Tresco, and the killer may soon strike again.Everyone is a suspect.Nobody is safe."},

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Fergus McNeill", "date": "Tuesday 19 February 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome FERGUS McNEILLto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSErin Kelly is one of those authors who just always seems to deliver, and I’ve admired her books ever since her debut The Poison Tree. Some authors tell great stories, and some have a beautiful style of writing, but when you get both together then you have something special. ... FILMS/MOVIESThere are so many to choose from, but I’m going to pick the original Dirty Harry movie. For me, it’s almost perfect – a wonderfully bleak anti-hero, a crazy-creepy villain, and a story that just keeps on raising the stakes. It even has a classic 70s soundtrack. I think the only thing wrong with it is the BRIGHT RED fake blood that those old films used. It looks like someone spilled a bottle of ketchup…... TV DRAMASI love The Bridge, Columbo, Morse/Endeavour, Jeremy Brett’s Sherlock Holmes and Joan Hickson’s Miss Marple… but my favourite TV drama must be Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy with Alec Guinness. Though not strictly crime, it’s very much a detective story, and I honestly can’t think of a better-made series.... FICTIONAL KILLERSA truly delicious villain from a darkly entertaining book is Mr Hemming from A Pleasure And A Calling. Mr Hemming is an estate agent who, over the years, has sold almost every house in the small town where he’s based… oh, and he’s kept a copy of EVERY key.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I think I have to go with Inspector Morse. Although there are obvious differences between the book and TV adaptations, he’s always a compelling character, absolutely certain of his hunches even though he’s prone to making mistakes. Despite the unlikable manner, there’s something very honest and very human about him.... MURDER WEAPONSOne of the cleverest murder weapons I ever read about was the sniper rifle from Day Of The Jackal by Frederick Forsyth. What made it so special (spoiler alert) was the way the gun disassembled into a series of pieces which could be hidden inside a wounded war veteran’s crutches. This allowed the assassin to smuggle it through a tight security perimeter, and make his shot.    ... DEATH SCENESI wouldn’t say I have a “favourite” death scene, as I’m far too squeamish to enjoy the gruesome ones properly. But the death of Ratchett in Murder On The Orient Express has always been memorable – there’s something grimly satisfying about a wicked man meeting his end at the hands of those whose lives he ruined.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI like to know the places I’m writing about, so I often use Google Streetview. Parts of my most recent book are set in the Swiss city of Bern and I’d spent so much time walking the virtual streets that, when I finally went there for real, I had the most uncanny sense of déjà vu.... WRITING TIPSGetting started always seems the most difficult part of a day’s writing. To combat this, I’ve found that it helps to sketch out the action in a series of bullet points first, listing what each character will do and say. This is a quick and easy way to capture ideas and plan the rhythm of a scene. It also makes it less painful to discard things if they’re not working! Once I have my bullet points, I go through again, filling in any dialogue and noting any key bits of narrative. From there, it’s a lot easier to write up the draft text.... WRITING SNACKSCoffee, coffee, and more coffee. And, if I’m working in a nice café, a good cinnamon Danish always helps.About FERGUS McNEILLFergus McNeill has been creating computer games since the early eighties, writing his first interactive fiction titles while still at school.

Closer inspection shows he is a manager of the company, and he’s been tortured. Three days later, another manager appears in similar circumstances.Chastity Riley and her new colleague Ivo Stepanovic are tasked with uncovering the truth behind the attacks, an investigation that goes far beyond the revenge they first suspect … to the dubious past shared by both victims. Travelling to the south of Germany, they step into the elite world of boarding schools, where secrets are currency, and monsters are bred … monsters who will stop at nothing to protect themselves.My verdictBeton Rouge is another strong character-led novel from German author Simone Buchholz, lovingly translated by Rachel Ward. Following on from Blue Night, it again features feisty and tough public prosecutor Chastity Riley and a mystery to solve.Beton Rouge isn't a particularly long book but there's a lot packed within its pages. Two unconscious men are discovered locked in cages outside the offices of a major German newspaper, both having been tortured and drugged. Plus there are flashbacks to boarding school students with bullying tendencies and plenty of secrets to hide.Despite being a crime novel, it's so much more than that - in fact, at times the crime investigation takes a backseat, as Chastity reveals thoughts on her life, friends and drinking habits and also the modern world we live in. She's funny, sharp and very blunt and it's great fun being inside her head, especially when she's in a reflective mood. So while the book is dark, it's also full of humour and sadness too.Short chapters, snappy sentences, witty dialogue and succinct writing have created a fast-paced read - saying 'just one more chapter' to myself led me to read most of the book in one sitting. Descriptions are vivid and rich, painting a colourful picture of of the German setting. I loved the chapter names - you'll have to discover these for yourself - all taken from a line or phrase from within the chapter itself.Finishing Beton Rouge left me wanting more. I really do hope there is more to come!"},

This was an unsettling experience, as the plot is filled with unreliability and secrecy, switching between Theo's narration in the present and flashbacks to Alicia's past. Theo is arrogant enough to believe that he will be the one to unlock Alicia's silence and to get her to talk again. I couldn't help but be mesmerised by his narrative - an unforgettable character.This intelligent debut novel left me stunned by the end, kicking myself because I really didn't see the final twist coming! I can't give any spoilers, so you'll just have to read the book to discover what I mean.I know it's only February, but The Silent Patient may well be one of the best psychological thrillers I'll review this year.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Inborn by Thomas Enger", "date": "Wednesday 13 February 2019", "text": "InbornBy Thomas EngerPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - out now; Paperback - 21 February 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhen the high school in the small Norwegian village of Fredheim becomes a murder scene, the finger is soon pointed at seventeen-year-old Even. As the investigation closes in, social media is ablaze with accusations, rumours and even threats, and Even finds himself the subject of an online trial as well as being in the dock … for murder?Even pores over his memories of the months leading up to the crime, and it becomes clear that more than one villager was acting suspiciously … and secrets are simmering beneath the calm surface of this close-knit community.As events from the past play tag with the present, he’s forced to question everything he thought he knew. Was the death of his father in a car crash a decade earlier really accidental? Has his relationship stirred up something that someone is prepared to kill to protect?It seems that there may be no one that Even can trust.But can we trust him?My verdictInborn is a tightly plotted mix of thriller and courtroom drama … compelling, twisty and full of emotion. This is a tale of murder, secrets and lies in a small Norwegian village, blending young adult (YA) with adult fiction. There are so many suspects (many unexpectedly revealed as the book progresses), making it very difficult to know who to trust. The format of the book is very clever, beginning with a chilling prologue and then leading into the police investigation and trial. I soon found myself right inside 17-year-old Even's head. I loved how the narrative moved seamlessly from Even in the courtroom in the present day to his first person narrative in the past (and back again), without repeating any of the events. This created two different versions of the same character - the one who knew the whole story (in the present) and the one in the past who still had a lot to learn.This isn't just a trial in a courtroom, however, but also a trial on social media. As teenagers carelessly point fingers and spread rumours, they have the potential to destroy innocent people's lives.The prosecutor's interrogation (in the courtroom chapters) reads like the narration of a play before the characters came back on stage. The dialogue is spot on - realistic and snappy. Using other narrators within the book, such as the police chief Yngve Monk who is grieving over the loss of his wife, builds up a bigger picture about the murder, suggesting that not everything is the way it seems. There is so much more I would say, but I wouldn't want to give away anything about the plot. I loved this book and can't praise it highly enough!FOLLOW THE BLOG TOUR"},

The theme is secrets. You tell her yours, and she’ll share some of hers.Stella might tell you about Tom, a boyfriend who likes to play games, about the mother who abandoned her, now back after fourteen years. She might tell you about the perfume bottle with the star-shaped stopper, or about her father …What Stella really wants to know is more about the mysterious man calling the station … who says he knows who killed Victoria, and has proof.Tonight is the night for secrets, and Stella wants to know everything…My verdictCall Me Star Girl addled my brain. I couldn’t stop thinking about it afterwards, as it's so much more than a psychological thriller.I think of Louise Beech as a chameleon of fiction - blurring the genre boundaries with her gorgeous writing. Yet again, you can tell that she has put her heart and soul into writing this book. This is literally full of blood, sweat and tears (murder, sex and grief).There’s a crime at the heart of Call Me Star Girl, but this is also a journey of self-discovery. I couldn’t tear myself away, wanting to hide from the truth yet desperate to know how everything would eventually pan out. Who killed pregnant Victoria Valbon? Who is the mysterious man who seems to know how she died? And what secrets will be revealed during Stella McKeever's final radio show? Call Me Star Girl is tense and gripping, powerful and shocking - a tale of love and loss. It's dark and twisty, yet also packed with passion and raw emotion. I was at the radio station with Stella, both on and off air. I felt part of her life, as she shared some of her secrets and her mother shared some of hers. I was there right until the end, with tears in my eyes and a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. Digesting. Thinking. Grieving.Yet another 'must read' from Louise Beech."},
{"title": "My Jewish-themed Reads Part 2 - #JBW2019", "date": "Friday 8 February 2019", "text": "Here are three more Jewish-themed reads. This year, I'm an official book blog partner of Jewish Book Week in London (2 to 10 March 2019), so I've made it my mission to read more Jewish-themed books throughout 2019.If you haven't yet booked for Jewish Book Week, tickets are still available. Visit the website - http://jewishbookweek.com - for more details.The Cut Out Girl by Bart Van EsPublished by Penguin in paperback in January 2019The Cut Out Girl won the Costa Book of the Year 2018 award. Bart Van Es will be speaking at Jewish Book Week on 10 March 2019, at 11 am at Kings Place, London.Publisher's descriptionLittle Lien wasn't taken from her Jewish parents - she was given away in the hope that she might be saved. Hidden and raised by a foster family in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation, she survived the war only to find that her real parents had not. Much later, she fell out with her foster family, and Bart van Es - the grandson of Lien's foster parents - knew he needed to find out why.His account of tracing Lien and telling her story is a searing exploration of two lives and two families. It is a story about love and misunderstanding and about the ways that our most painful experiences - so crucial in defining us - can also be redefined.My verdictThe Cut Out Girl is a moving story of family and childhood - a book of loss, love, hope and remembrance. Young Lien was 'cut out' of her family and raised by foster parents, in the hope that she would survive the war and the horrors of the Holocaust. This is a mixture of memoir and social and political history, told through the eyes of author Bart Van Es, grandson of Lien's foster parents and now an Oxford professor. It's an intimate look at a young Jewish girl's time in hiding, but also a deeper look at the Nazi occupation of Holland. The factual content is seamlessly woven into the narrative, as chapters switch between Bart Van Es's research in the present day and Lien's story in the past. The book is harrowing and upsetting in places, but needs to be read - just as it needed to be written. A testament not only to the resilience of young Lien, but also to the Dutch families who risked their lives to hide her and so many other Jewish people. To book a ticket for Bart Van Es's Jewish Book Week event, click here.The Sisters of the Winter Wood by Rena Rossner Published in hardback by Orbit in September 2018 - paperback being published in June 2019Publisher's descriptionIn a remote village surrounded by forests on the border of Moldova and Ukraine, sisters Liba and Laya have been raised on the honeyed scent of their Mami's babka and the low rumble of their Tati's prayers. But when a troupe of mysterious men arrives, Laya falls under their spell - despite their mother's warning to be wary of strangers. And this is not the only danger lurking in the woods.As dark forces close in on their small village, Liba and Laya discover a family secret passed down through generations. Faced with a magical heritage they never knew existed, the sisters realise the old fairy tales are true . . . and could save them all.My verdictI was mesmerised by The Sisters of the Winter Wood. It's a fantasy mix, twining together Jewish traditions with Russian folklore and fairytales (based on the Goblin Market, a poem written in the 19th century). This enchanting coming-of-age novel is filled with lyrical prose - a story of forbidden love, family secrets and a window into a hidden world. It's a cross between YA and adult fiction - some of the chapters (those by Laya) are written in verse and you have to enjoy magical realism. I loved it, as I've been seeking Jewish-themed reads that are 'different' - and this one certainly stands out from the crowd!Raising Sparks by Ariel KahnPublished by Bluemoose Books in July 2018Ariel Kahn will be speaking at Jewish Book Week on 3 March 2019, at 6.30 pm at Kings Place, London.Publisher's description: I've actually decided not to include the publisher's description that I found on Amazon UK, as this is more of a synopsis of the book rather than a blurb and I don't want to give everything away here. But obviously you can read this description for yourself on Amazon! But instead, here's my own summary: When sixteen-year-old Malka finds Russian immigrant Moshe (one of her father's students) studying the forbidden Kabbalistic texts, she uncovers her own mystical gifts. Malta runs away from the family home in Jerusalem, and her ultra-orthodox lifestyle, to embark on a journey of self-discovery, filled with danger, revelations and ultimately love.My verdictYou can't get much more Jewish themed than Raising Sparks, which opens with a Friday afternoon scene in which a Jewish family are preparing for the Sabbath (Shabbat). This novel is set in modern Israel, with its array of different religions and cultures trying (and sometimes struggling) to exist together, and the difficulties experienced by modern ultra-orthodox Jewish families as the world around them changes. Insights into Kabbalah, and its background, are woven into the plot, so there's a lot to take in. The book also celebrates Jewish symbolism and culture (culinary delights and social experiences, not just the religion itself). Raising Sparks is warm and touching, with some powerful and moving scenes and rich, descriptive prose that paints vivid imagery. It raises many questions about coincidence, curiosity, human nature and society, and has the potential to prompt significant discussion!To book a ticket for Ariel Kahn's Jewish Book Week event, click here.So that's it for now! But I have many more Jewish-themed books on my list and will reading (and reviewing) them over the coming months. So do pop back to Off-the-Shelf Books for more updates!"},

In the denouement, however, he unveils the conspiracy at the heart of the tale by donning war paint and punching every single person involved. It’s unbelievably entertaining.... MURDER WEAPONSA can of expanding foam filler. When I was a teenager, the Head of English summoned me to explain myself after I wrote a short story (based on a scene from Stephen King’s The Dark Half) where a home invasion ended with someone asphyxiating on a throat full of foam insulation.

AUTHORSThomas Harris. Aside from his complex characters, so real (and often disturbing) they jump of the page and stay with me long after I’ve closed the book, I also love the profiling aspects he weaves so brilliantly through his stories. I’m similarly in awe of his plotting and ability to deliver a sucker punch twist. That knock on the door scene at the end of Silence of the Lambs - wow!... FILMS/MOVIESKramer vs Kramer.  I first watched it with a bunch of friends at uni, and have watched it again on my own several times since, always with a large box of Keenex. Starring Dustin Hoffman (who I’m a little bit in love with) it tells the story of a couple’s custody battle and its heartbreaking impact on their young son. Ted Kramer (played by Hoffman) is a workaholic with no time for his family. He races home to tell his wife he’s just landed an amazing new account to which she replies, ‘I’m leaving you’…... TV DRAMASBetter Call Saul. I loved Breaking Bad (who didn’t?) but for me, Better Call Saul is even better. It has the same intense character focus, beautiful cinematography and feel of a novel, but it also incorporates a note perfect pathos in the fall of its protagonist.... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibal Lecter.  That was an easy one to answer, he’s everything a villain should be- venal yet not black and white. And he has some killer lines: “I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti”. Brilliant!... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Sherlock Holmes. My character calls him the ‘godfather of profiling’ and she’s right! I started reading the short stories when I was thirteen, captivated by his ability to deduce so much about a person just by looking at them. ... MURDER WEAPONSWell, that would have to be the method used in Behind Her Eyes (so ingenious, and more than a little bit creepy!) though I can’t say more without giving the whole book away…    ... DEATH SCENESThe opening of Lullaby in which two children are murdered by their nanny. The description of the little girl dying is shocking but what makes her death even more heartbreaking is the sound of her mother’s scream when she finds her: “She let out a scream, a scream from deep within, the howl of a she-wolf. It made the walls tremble.”  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESGoogle Earth because you can travel round the world and ‘walk’ the streets your characters roam without leaving your desk chair (useful when you have to factor in school drop-offs and pick-ups)....

Everyone’s different, but I find it really important not to think too hard about the precision of the words I’m using when penning a first draft, to just let the story flow.

{"title": "The Last by Hanna Jameson", "date": "Wednesday 30 January 2019", "text": "The Lastby Hanna JamesonPublished by Penguin Viking (31 January 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionBREAKING: Nuclear weapon detonates over WashingtonBREAKING: London hit, thousands feared deadBREAKING: Munich and Scotland hit. World leaders call for calmHistorian Jon Keller is on a trip to Switzerland when the world ends. As the lights go out on civilisation, he wishes he had a way of knowing whether his wife, Nadia, and their two daughters are still alive. More than anything, Jon wishes he hadn't ignored Nadia's last message. Twenty people remain in Jon's hotel. Far from the nearest city and walled in by towering trees, they wait, they survive.Then one day, the body of a young girl is found. It's clear she has been murdered. Which means that someone in the hotel is a killer.As paranoia descends, Jon decides to investigate. But how far is he willing to go in pursuit of justice? And what kind of justice can he hope for, when society as he knows it no longer exists?My verdictThe Last is post-apocalyptic fiction, yet it's really a novel of the modern age - dystopian fiction that no longer seems so unbelievable.Twenty people appear to be the last survivors of a global nuclear attack, holed up in a remote Swiss hotel after a work conference with no way of communicating with the outside world. Historian Jon is determined to log their last days and weeks, hoping that one day someone will find his notebooks. When he finds the body of a young girl, he suspects murder. But who is killer?The Last is a dark, disturbing and thought-provoking read. Think The Walking Dead without zombies, with characters having to work together (or not!) to survive and unsure what lies outside their newly created comfort zone. The plot is fast-paced and tense, with a perfect mixture of action, mystery, survival and sense of bewilderment and paranoia, all in a claustrophobic setting. The book is beautifully written, highly graphic and would translate well to the big (or little) screen. It prompted so many questions of 'what if?' and 'what would I do?' as I read, and the ending was chilling.  Highly recommended!"},
{"title": "Red Snow by Will Dean", "date": "Monday 28 January 2019", "text": "Red SnowBy Will DeanPublished by Point Blank (10 January 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionTWO BODIESOne suicide. One cold-blooded murder. Are they connected? And who’s really pulling the strings in the small Swedish town of Gavrik?TWO COINSBlack Grimberg liquorice coins cover the murdered man's eyes. The hashtag #Ferryman starts to trend as local people stock up on ammunition.TWO WEEKSTuva Moodyson, deaf reporter at the local paper, has a fortnight to investigate the deaths before she starts her new job in the south. A blizzard moves in. Residents, already terrified, feel increasingly cut-off. Tuva must go deep inside the Grimberg factory to stop the killer before she leaves town for good. But who’s to say the Ferryman will let her go?My verdictDark Pines was one of my favourite books of 2018. And yet again, Will Dean has written a compelling and more-than-slightly-bizarre character-led crime novel featuring deaf reporter Tuva Moodyson. Red Snow follows on from Dark Pines, but could probably be read as a standalone.Tuva is investigating an apparent suicide and murder at the local liquorice factory. The clock is ticking, as she leaves the small Swedish town of Gavrik to start a new job in the larger town of Malmo in just two weeks. The liquorice factory is very much the centre of the local community, as it's one of the main employers, and is also very much the centre of the book. The local ghostwriter is writing about the history of the factory and asks Tuva to help him research the Grimberg family who own it. Tuva sees this as the perfect opportunity to get to know the usually private family better, hoping this will help her to investigate the recent deaths.Red Snow is written at a slower pace than the previous book but with the same beautiful descriptive writing and array of quirky characters. It's highly atmospheric, highlighting the remoteness and claustrophobic feel of Gavrik during the winter months with a blizzard moving in. I loved reading about how people living there cope with the bitter temperatures and the lack of daylight - the use of UV lamps to cope with seasonal affective disorder, for example. Tuva's deafness doesn't usually affect her daily life, but it can become more of a challenge when she removes her hearing aids to protect them from the damp, icy or snowy weather when she's outdoors.The book manages to entertain as well as chill. Will Dean's characters remind me of Willy Wonka and some of the other members of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory cast, especially the Grimberg family who are not only eccentric but also slightly menacing at times. The dialogue is spot on, with dark humour and quick witty retorts, providing great character dynamics. Some of the characters were present in Dark Pines, but there are also some new ones, including a police officer to provide Tuva with a love interest.I look forward to see what's next as Tuva heads to pastures new.Will Dean is one of the First Monday Crime's February panel members (on 4th February 2019 at City University, London).

He's managed to find someone new after the sudden death of his first wife - but something about Evie just doesn't feel right...When Evie starts having accidents at home, her friends grow concerned. Could Mark be causing her injuries? Called out to their cliff-top house one night, Sergeant Stephanie King finds two bodies entangled on blood-drenched sheets.Where does murder begin? When the knife is raised to strike, or before, at the first thought of violence? As the accused stands trial, the jury is forced to consider - is there ever a proper defence for murder?My verdictAnd So It Begins is yet another highly unpredictable psychological thriller from Rachel Abbott.I raced through this, all the way to the shocker of an ending, my head swirling from all of the twists and turns. The chapters are fairly short, which encouraged me to keep reading into the early hours.The plot focuses on a murder at the home of photographer Marcus North, the events leading up to that time and the investigation afterwards. Rachel Abbott consistently creates evocative settings and believable, multi-layered plots. She also manages to get right inside her characters' minds. I had no idea which characters were telling the truth and who could be trusted - a lesson in 'don't believe everything you're told'.Each Rachel Abbott book is very different (in this one, the theme is revenge, but also sibling relationships), yet all are of the same high quality. I love her Tom Douglas series, but believe this may be her best yet and I'm hoping this may be the start of a new series featuring Sergeant Stephanie King and DCI Gus Brodie."},

In a great haste, she escapes to Sweden, saving herself. Her family in Oslo, however, is deported to Auschwitz. In Stockholm, Ester meets the resistance hero, Gerhard Falkum, who has left his little daughter and fled both the Germans and allegations that he murdered his wife, Åse, who helped Ester get to Sweden. Their burgeoning relationship ends abruptly when Falkum dies in a fire.And yet, twenty-five years later, Falkum shows up in Oslo. He wants to reconnect with his daughter. But where has he been, and what is the real reason for his return? Ester stumbles across information that forces her to look closely at her past, and to revisit her war-time training to stay alive…My verdictThe Courier is a literary spy thriller, perfect for John Le Carré fans, and a very welcome addition to the Nordic Noir genre.The book is steeped in history - Norway in World War 2 and the plight of its Jewish people during the Holocaust - with roots in espionage and wartime resistance. Its female protagonist, Ester, is strong and courageous, highlighting the importance of women during the war and how they risked their lives. I was fascinated by the social and political background, knowing very little about the Nazi invasion of Norway during World War 2. I found myself Googling snippets of information as I read the book - and now I've finished I want to know more!The book features a tightly threaded plot and convincing characterisation, so it didn't take long to worm its way under my skin. I was soon caught up in the lives of Ester, Gerhard, Sverre, Åsa and Turid. There's a sense of unease throughout the book, as Ester seeks answers to how her friend Åsa died. I was holding my breath in several gripping moments as she, Sverre and Gerhard played their cat-and-mouse games. I had no idea who to trust and who to believe, right until the final scenes.The narrative switches seamlessly between Oslo and Stockholm in 1942 and Oslo in 1967 and 2015. Each chapter is clearly marked with the year and location so the multiple timelines were very easy to follow.  The writing is excellent (translated by Don Bartlett) - sparse where it needs to be, to move the story along at a fast pace, but highly descriptive elsewhere, with acute observations that paint a vivid picture of people and places.So much tension bubbles away under the surface. But this is far more than just a thriller and a murder mystery. It's also a heartbreaking read, as Ester learns more about what happened to her family and her childhood friend. The ending brought tears to my eyes but also a strong sense of resolution.Highly recommended!"},

An unidentified body hangs upon a hook at Deptford Dock – horribly tortured and branded with a slaver’s mark. Some days later, Captain Harry Corsham – a war hero embarking upon a promising parliamentary career – is visited by the sister of an old friend. Her brother, passionate abolitionist Tad Archer, had been about to expose a secret that he believed could cause irreparable damage to the British slaving industry. He’d said people were trying to kill him, and now he is missing . . .To discover what happened to Tad, Harry is forced to pick up the threads of his friend’s investigation, delving into the heart of the conspiracy Tad had unearthed. His investigation will threaten his political prospects, his family’s happiness, and force a reckoning with his past, risking the revelation of secrets that have the power to destroy him.And that is only if he can survive the mortal dangers awaiting him in Deptford . . .My verdictBlood & Sugar is a compelling historical crime thriller, delving into the darkness and horrors of the slave trade and the rise of the abolitionist movement in the late 18th century.The book is well researched and feels authentic, bringing to life an array of strong characters and the colours, sights and sounds of the Deptford setting. I savoured all of the tiny details - from the opulence of the wealthy to the grime of the dockside slums. Author Laura Shepherd-Robinson gets right into the hearts of her characters, as well as their heads. Protagonist Harry Corsham is easy to like, with his strong sense of duty and determination, not afraid to dive into danger in search of the truth.The complex plot is unpredictable, dark and twisty, filled with murders and abuse, secrets and lies, conspiracies and corruption. It's brutal and gruesome, yet also handled with sensitivity. There's a underlying sadness, as the slave trade casts its shadow on to so many people's lives.Blood & Sugar is an impressive page-turning debut - a beautifully written, honest look at the social and political unrest of this period in history. I can easily see this book transferring to the screen - big or small. I also enjoyed reading the historical note at the end of the book, providing some of the factual background that influenced the plot."},
{"title": "The Stranger Diaries by Elly Griffiths", "date": "Thursday 17 January 2019", "text": "The Stranger DiariesBy Elly GriffithsPublished by Quercus (1 November 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionA dark story has been brought to terrifying life. Can the ending be rewritten in time?Clare Cassidy is no stranger to tales of murder. As a literature teacher specialising in the Gothic writer R.M. Holland, she teaches a short course on them every year. Then Clare's life and work collide tragically when one of her colleagues is found dead, a line from an R.M. Holland story by her body. The investigating police detective is convinced the writer's works somehow hold the key to the case.Not knowing who to trust, and afraid that the killer is someone she knows, Clare confides her darkest suspicions and fears about the case to her journal. Then one day she notices some other writing in the diary. Writing that isn't hers...My verdictElly Griffiths has written a compelling and entertaining modern-day gothic mystery.The Stranger Diaries is a spooky mix of police procedural and psychological thriller, linking murders in a secondary school to a creepy Victorian story (which is revealed in snippets throughout the book and then in full at the end). The plot moves at a fast pace, building up the suspense, with cliffhangers at the end of each chapter leading to 'just one more'. The author's lyrical writing flows beautifully, with plenty of rhythm within her prose, leading me to read much of the book out loud. All three narrators - teacher Clare Cassidy, her teenage daughter Georgie and police officer DS Harbinger Kaur - seemed authentic and believable. I particularly loved DS Kaur, with her wit, bluntness and warmth, and hope she will appear in another Elly Griffiths book in the future. Using different narrators means that although we get inside their heads, we also see each character from someone else's point of view (often in a different light so maybe trust them a little bit less). We also experience events and conversations from multiple sides, which can be unnerving and slightly disorientating, adding to the supernatural feel of the book. The Stranger Diaries is cleverly plotted, mixing past and present and dropping in red herrings and false leads, playing games with the reader's mind. It certainly kept me on my toes. I tried very hard to guess the whodunnit but failed!"},
{"title": "My Jewish-themed Reads Part 1 - #JBW2019", "date": "Tuesday 15 January 2019", "text": "This year, I'm an official book blog partner of Jewish Book Week in London (2 to 10 March 2019), so I've made it my mission to read more Jewish-themed books throughout 2019.Booking for the 85+ events during Jewish Book Week opened on Wednesday 9th January. Visit the website - http://jewishbookweek.com - for more details. I'll be coming along to three events taking place on Saturday 9th and Sunday 10th March. Hopefully I'll do some live tweeting while I'm there and also write a summary post on Off-the-Shelf Books afterwards.So which Jewish-themed books have I read so far?Bitter by Francesca JakobiPublished by W&N in October 2018Bitter by Francesca Jakobi was the first Jewish-themed book I read with Jewish Book Week in mind. At 12 pm on Sunday 3rd March 2019, at Kings Place, London, Francesca will be talking about the perils and pitfalls of fictionalising a family story. Bitter was inspired by her grandmother, who was sued for divorce in the 1940s.Publisher's descriptionIt's 1969, and while the summer of love lingers in London, Gilda is consumed by the mistakes of her past. She walked out on her beloved son Reuben when he was just a boy and fears he will never forgive her. When Reuben marries Alice, he seems transformed by love - a love Gilda has craved his entire adult life. What does his new wife have that she doesn't? And how far will she go to find out? It's an obsession that will bring shocking truths about the past to light . . .My verdictThis is a bittersweet character-led tale of a mother's obsessive love for her son and her resulting jealousy for her new daughter-in-law. It's beautifully written and emotionally tense, with poignant insights into Jewish family life and the period between the Second World War and the late 1960s. Filled with secrets from the past, the story manages to be both sinister and moving at the same time. Gilda's acerbic voice got right under my skin, eventually worming its way into my heart, as understanding her past helped me to understand her present. The book chilled me, gripped me and entertained me - an unforgettable character and story.To book a ticket for Francesca's Jewish Book Week event, click here.The Emperor of Shoes by Spencer Wise Published in hardback by No Exit Press in July 2018 - paperback being published in April 2019Publisher's descriptionAlex Cohen, a twenty-six-year-old Jewish Bostonian, is living in southern China, where his father runs their family-owned shoe factory. Alex reluctantly assumes the helm of the company, but as he explores the plant's vast floors and assembly lines, he comes to a grim realisation: employees are exploited, regulatory systems are corrupt and Alex's own father is engaging in bribes to protect the bottom line. When Alex meets a seamstress named Ivy, his sympathies begin to shift. She is an embedded organiser of a pro-democratic Chinese party, secretly sowing dissonance among her fellow labourers. Will Alex remain loyal to his father and his heritage? Or will the sparks of revolution ignite?My verdictThe Emperor of Shoes is a fascinating blend of Jewish and Chinese cultures, with a focus on contemporary social and political themes at a time of vast change and revolution. It's also a love story and an exploration of difficult father-son relationships, portrayed through emotional scenes and Yiddish humour. Vivid descriptions transported me to contemporary Southern China. I felt as though I was there alongside the characters, seeing, hearing, smelling and feeling the contrast between the hustle and bustle of city life and the tranquility of the rural areas. This book is a thought-provoking exploration of the working conditions in Chinese factories, communism versus capitalism and Jewish identity.Invisible City & Run You Down by Julia DahlInvisible City was published by Faber on 31 July 2018.Run You Down was published by Faber on 1 January 2019.Publisher's description: Invisible CityFresh out of journalism school, Rebekah Roberts is working for the New York Tribune, trying to make a name for herself. Assigned a story about the murder of a woman in Brooklyn, Rebekah finds a case from inside a closed, secretive Hasidic Jewish community - the same Brooklyn neighbourhood her estranged mother was brought up in.Shocked to discover that the victim is set to be buried without an autopsy, Rebekah knows there is a story to uncover, but getting to the truth won't be easy - in the cloistered world her mother rebelled against, it's clear she's not welcome, and everyone she meets has a secret to keep, most of all from an outsider.Publisher's description: Run You DownAviva Kagan was just a teenager when she left her Hasidic Jewish life in Brooklyn for a fling with a smiling college boy from Florida. A few months later she was pregnant, engaged to be married and trapped in a life she never imagined. So, shortly after the birth of her daughter she disappeared.Twenty-three years later, the child she walked away from, NYC tabloid reporter Rebekah Roberts, wants nothing to do with her. But when a man from the ultra-Orthodox enclave of Roseville, NY contacts Rebekah about his young wife's mysterious death, she is drawn into Aviva's old world, and a hidden culture full of dangerous secrets and frustrations.My verdictInvisible City and Run You Down are the first two books in a crime fiction series featuring reporter Rebekah Roberts. I read Invisible City in the summer and Run You Down in the last few weeks. Both books are set within the Ultra-Orthodox Hassidic Jewish communities in Brooklyn, where Rebekah freelances for the local tabloid newspaper. Rebekah's mother Aviva was brought up within this community, rebelled, became pregnant and then returned to them (leaving Rebekah with her father). This helps to introduce religious Jewish culture, as Rebekah learns more about the traditions and her own heritage during her investigations. Both books are thought provoking, covering social issues and contemporary themes, including diversity, race and religion, gun control, white supremacy, acceptance, racism and anti-semitism. They are also bittersweet stories of family relationships and self-discovery. So that's it for now! But I have many more Jewish-themed books on my list and will reading (and reviewing) them over the coming year. So do pop back to Off-the-Shelf Books for more updates!"},
{"title": "Deep Dirty Truth by Steph Broadribb", "date": "Monday 14 January 2019", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for Deep Dirty Truth by Steph Broadribb. Deep Dirty Truth is published in paperback by Orenda Books on 24th January 2019. It's the third book in the Lori Anderson action thriller series.Deep Dirty TruthBy Steph BroadribbPublished by Orenda Books (ebook - out now; paperback - 24 January 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionA price on her head. A secret worth dying for. Just 48 hours to expose the truth…Single-mother bounty hunter Lori Anderson has finally got her family back together, but her new-found happiness is shattered when she’s snatched by the Miami Mob – and they want her dead. Rather than a bullet, they offer her a job: find the Mob’s ‘numbers man’ – Carlton North – who’s in protective custody after being forced to turn federal witness against them. If Lori succeeds, they’ll wipe the slate clean and the price on her head – and those of her family – will be removed. If she fails, they die.My verdictI'm more than a little in love with Deep Dirty Truth. In fact, I raced through the first two books in this series - Deep Down Dead and Deep Blue Trouble - but THIS book has now stolen my heart even more than they did.There's not really much more for me to say, other than READ IT or, rather, READ THEM ALL! But I do usually write slightly longer reviews. So what can I say about this book, other than 'it is brilliant'?Deep Dirty Truth is an action-packed, adrenaline-pumping rollercoaster read - a race against the clock. It's so fast-paced that I barely drew a breath and didn't have time to make notes, which isn't ideal when you need to write a review (and why I may be waffling here - sorry, as it's not something I usually do).The Lori Anderson series reminds me a lot of the Stephanie Plum series (by Janet Evanovich), which I used to read voraciously but haven't read for years. But, to me, the Lori Anderson series is even better - it's full of emotion and the writing is fantastic. Lori is more than just a bounty hunter - she puts her role as a mother first, every time. Everything she does is for the sake of her young daughter, Dakota, even if it means putting her own life in danger to keep Dakota safe.Deep Dirty Truth and the previous two books feel very real, which isn't surprising as the author has spent a lot of time in the USA and even trained as a bounty hunter herself. Steph Broadribb writes vivid descriptions of characters, action and setting - I felt like I was there too. She's created a great family dynamic between Lori and JT and Dakota, and I even love some of the more-minor characters I'm not supposed to even like.Everything in the book is tied up neatly by the end (well, almost everything - at least, everything that needs to be - you'll just have to read it to find out more). The scene is now set perfectly for the next instalment and I can't wait to see both Lori and JT in action.Bring it on!!! Go #TeamLoriFollow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Julia Dahl", "date": "Friday 11 January 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome JULIA DAHLto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSIt feels impossible to pick a favorite among so many, but I suppose if I had to take the books of just one crime author to a deserted island it would probably be Patricia Highsmith. She is an absolute master of menace. The sun is shining in paradise, everyone dresses for dinner, but the ugliness beneath the surface casts a pall over everything.... FILMS/MOVIESMy lifelong love affair with the Coen Brothers began in 1996 with Fargo. It’s a wickedly funny, twisted drama about a kidnapping gone wrong in the frozen tundra of America’s upper Midwest. Joel and Ethan Coen have an uncanny ability to inhabit and illuminate subcultures that has you rooting for everyone, even the most depraved career criminal.... TV DRAMASSoon after I moved to New York the HBO series Six Feet Under premiered. It’s the story of a family in Los Angeles that runs a funeral home and at the beginning of each episode, we watch someone (whom the family will later bury) die. It wasn’t a crime show, per se, but death was an integral part of the fabric of the character’s lives. That darkness permeated their psyches and affected them in endlessly fascinating ways.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESJessica Fletcher of Murder, She Wrote. I started watching this television show as a pre-teen and decided my life goal was to be Jessica: a crime novelist/amateur sleuth. I haven’t solved any murders yet, but maybe it’s just a matter of time. Jessica (otherwise known by her nom de plume, J.B. Fletcher) was a feminist hero. She was a widow with a booming career (an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Maine? Unheard of!), a generous heart, and a spot-on bullshit detector. The first gift my husband gave me when we started dating was a book in the Murder, She Wrote series – I knew I’d found “the one.”... DEATH SCENE I have to go back to Fargo for this, too. At the end of the film, the character played by Steve Buscemi meets his end…inside a wood chipper.... BLOGS/WEBSITESLocal newspapers are where I go to learn about contemporary crime. These days, there are around 17,000 homicides in the U.S. each year, and much as I love the New York Times, the paper of record doesn’t cover more than a handful. If you want to know who is killing who and how justice is – or isn’t – meted out, you need to read the Fresno Bee, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Arizona Sun. ... WRITING TIPSI’ve read that there are two kinds of writers: those who plan, and those who run to the end. I am the latter. I want to get the skeleton of the book as fast as I can so that I have a solid structure to work with. If I’m writing a scene that I know needs details I don’t have at the moment, I use the journalistic notation “TK” (meaning, to come) and skip ahead. Getting caught up on small things can slow your progress.About JULIA DAHLJulia Dahl is the author of three novels about a New York City crime reporter: INVISIBLE CITY, RUN YOU DOWN, and CONVICTION.

Here's my Author Catch up with a double review, for the Run You Down Blog Tour.Invisible City and Run You Down are the first two books in a crime fiction series featuring reporter Rebekah Roberts. Both books are set within the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn, where Rebekah freelances for the local tabloid newspaper. The third book, which I haven't yet read, is called Conviction.Invisible City: Publisher's descriptionFresh out of journalism school, Rebekah Roberts is working for the New York Tribune, trying to make a name for herself. Assigned a story about the murder of a woman in Brooklyn, Rebekah finds a case from inside a closed, secretive Hasidic Jewish community - the same Brooklyn neighbourhood her estranged mother was brought up in.Shocked to discover that the victim is set to be buried without an autopsy, Rebekah knows there is a story to uncover, but getting to the truth won't be easy - in the cloistered world her mother rebelled against, it's clear she's not welcome, and everyone she meets has a secret to keep, most of all from an outsider.Run You Down: Publisher's descriptionAviva Kagan was just a teenager when she left her Hasidic Jewish life in Brooklyn for a fling with a smiling college boy from Florida. A few months later she was pregnant, engaged to be married and trapped in a life she never imagined. So, shortly after the birth of her daughter she disappeared.Twenty-three years later, the child she walked away from, NYC tabloid reporter Rebekah Roberts, wants nothing to do with her. But when a man from the ultra-Orthodox enclave of Roseville, NY contacts Rebekah about his young wife's mysterious death, she is drawn into Aviva's old world, and a hidden culture full of dangerous secrets and frustrations.My verdict of both booksBoth books provide a fascinating insight into the Ultra-Orthodox Hassidic (Chasidic - if you are in the UK) Jewish communities, which often remain an enigma to outsiders. Julia Dahl gets right into the heart of the problems that Jewish families (and individuals) face from within their own community as well as the outside world. In particular, she focuses on the darker side - what happens when some people choose to escape what they feel is a restrictive religious lifestyle and how the community closes ranks when necessary (for example, in cases of murder or abuse). Her books prove that there is just as much diversity within these communities as there is within the rest of the world (Jewish or otherwise) - helping to break down religious stereotyping.In Invisible City, Rebekah Roberts is dragged into an investigation within the local Hassidic community when a young mother is murdered. At the same time, she's wondering what happened to her own mother Aviva, who was brought up within this community, rebelled, became pregnant and then returned to them (leaving Rebekah with her father). The book is an interesting whodunnit, with a twisty, multi-layered plot. It provides an introduction to the secret world of the Hassidic community, as Rebekah learns more about Jewish traditions and her own heritage during her investigations.Run You Down follows almost straight on from Invisible City. Rebekah is investigating the supposed suicide of a young woman. The husband believes instead that it was murder. But due to the Jewish tradition of burying bodies within 24 hours of a death and the Hassidic community not wanting to seek attention, the family refuses an autopsy and investigation. The narrative switches between Rebekah and Aviva, providing an insight into why Rebekah's mother left the religious community - and then returned to it. At first, Aviva's story of the past seems to break up Rebekah's investigation in the present, but it gradually becomes clear that there is a link between the two. The pace ramps up in the second half in particular, culminating in a dramatic conclusion.Invisible City and Run You Down are both thought-provoking crime novels that cover social issues and contemporary themes, including diversity, race and religion, gun control, white supremacy, acceptance, racism and anti-semitism. They are also bittersweet stories of family relationships and self-discovery. Protagonist Rebekah is a well-rounded, likeable character. As a journalist, she's determined to find a publishable story, whatever it takes. But with personal connections to the Jewish community, she also has to maintain empathy and sensitivity towards the people she's investigating - just as Julia Dahl has done in writing these multi-layered books. The stories feel believable and very real, emotional and poignant as well as gripping and compelling.I look forward to reading Conviction to see how the series moves forward, develops and grows along with its main characters.Invisible City was published by Faber on 31 July 2018.Run You Down was published by Faber on 1 January 2019."},
{"title": "Changeling by Matt Wesolowski - Six Stories Series Spotlight", "date": "Wednesday 9 January 2019", "text": "I am delighted to be today's slot on the Blog Tour for Changeling by Matt Wesolowski. I've read all three books in his Six Stories series so far (published by Orenda Books) and urge you to read them if you haven't already done so. Here's a brief recap to help you catch up.About the seriesThe three books in the series so far are Six Stories, Hydra and Changeling. These classic murder mysteries are given a modern twist with their hint of horror and supernatural. Each book is skilfully executed through a series of six podcasts. They all feature the reclusive journalist Scott King, who is investigating cold cases by interviewing leading witnesses to see if they reveal further snippets of information.The books feel so real that part of me is convinced that these are genuine cases and genuine podcasts and that Matt Wesolowski has a secret life as a crime podcaster. This would mean he IS his character, but he hasn't revealed that yet! 😜😂😱Six Stories (published in paperback on 15 March 2017)1997. Scarclaw Fell. The body of teenager Tom Jeffries is found at an outward bound centre. Verdict? Misadventure. But not everyone is convinced. And the truth of what happened in the beautiful but eerie fell is locked in the memories of the tight-knit group of friends who took that fateful trip, and the flimsy testimony of those living nearby. 2017. Enter elusive investigative journalist Scott King, whose podcast examinations of complicated cases have rivalled the success of Serial, with his concealed identity making him a cult internet figure.My verdictSix Stories is an eerie spine-tingling read. It's unpredictable and chilling and kept me guessing all the way through. I don't scare easily, but certainly found this book unsettling. Matt Wesolowski has built up a dark, atmospheric setting with his vivid descriptive prose. The voices were so distinctive that I felt like I was listening to a podcast rather than simply reading the transcript. I built up a picture of the people, relationships between characters and an amazing sense of place. It felt more like fact than fiction - and I had to keep reminding myself that Scarclaw Fell isn't real!To read my full review, click here.Hydra (published in paperback on 15 January 2018)Before Scarfell Claw, there was Hydra… One cold November night in 2014, in a small town in the north west of England, 26-year-old Arla Macleod bludgeoned her mother, father and younger sister to death with a hammer, in an unprovoked attack known as the 'Macleod Massacre'. Now incarcerated at a medium-security mental-health institution, Arla will speak to no one but Scott King, an investigative journalist, whose ‘Six Stories’ podcasts have become an internet sensation. King finds himself immersed in an increasingly complex case, interviewing five witnesses and Arla herself, as he questions whether Arla’s responsibility for the massacre was a diminished as her legal team made out. As he unpicks the stories, he finds himself thrust into a world of deadly forbidden ‘games’, online trolls, and the mysterious Black-eyed Children, whose presence extends far beyond the delusions of a murderess…  My verdictHydra is just as creepy and chilling - a perfect mix of crime, horror and supernatural - and just as unsettling. It follows the same brilliant format as Six Stories - six linked podcasts investigating a cold case (the Macleod Massacre). Investigative journalist Scott King interviews six different witnesses, including Arla Macleod herself - now held in a medium-security mental health institution. This book reveals the dark side of teenage obsessive behaviour - do you really know what your teenagers are up to behind their locked doors?To read my full review, click here.Changeling (published in paperback on 24 January 2019)On Christmas Eve in 1988, seven-year-old Alfie Marsden vanished in the Wentshire Forest Pass, when a burst tyre forced his father, Sorrel, to stop the car. Leaving the car to summon the emergency services, Sorrel returned to find his son gone. No trace of the child, nor his remains, have ever been found. Alfie Marsden was declared officially dead in 1995.Elusive online journalist, Scott King, whose ‘Six Stories’ podcasts have become an internet sensation, investigates the disappearance, interviewing six witnesses, including Sorrel, his son and his ex-partner, to try to find out what really happened that fateful night. He takes a journey through the trees of the Wentshire Forest – a place synonymous with strange sightings, and tales of hidden folk who dwell there. He talks to a company that tried and failed to build a development in the forest, and a psychic who claims to know where Alfie is…My verdictA missing child, a grieving father, a neglectful alcoholic mother, things that go tap tap tap in the night, local folklore, creepy forests... Plus gripping writing, authentic dialogue, heart-pounding tension and a final twist that I seriously didn’t see coming! Yes, as you may have guessed, I loved Changeling.To read my full review, click here.Message to Matt Wesolowski and Karen Sullivan (Orenda Books): Bring on the next one! I'm assuming that there is a next one ... and hoping that we don't have to wait TOO long! No pressure. None at all. ⏳😂Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Alex Reeve", "date": "Friday 4 January 2019", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome ALEX REEVEto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSGosh, it’s so hard to pick just one! If you asked me tomorrow, I might have a different answer, but today I’ll say Sarah Waters for Fingersmith. She writes with huge compassion and authenticity, and was an inspiration for The House on Half Moon Street. She also shows why crime writers shouldn’t set out to write formulaic crime novels; we should create engaging characters, settings and plots that happen to involve a crime.... FILMS/MOVIESFargo, directed by the Coen brothers, is a movie I can watch again and again. Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand) is a heavily pregnant police officer in frozen Minnesota investigating a bungled homicide. The story works like clockwork and everything that happens, however awful and horrifying, is driven by the fears, desires and flaws of the characters.... TV DRAMASI’m a massive fan of police procedurals, but I’m still going to pick Breaking Bad. I love the relentless descent of Walter White (Bryan Cranston) from mild and desperate to utterly ruthless. I believe that a propensity for violence was always within him, but it needed the right trigger, making him a great example of why ‘because he’s evil’ never works as character motivation. We all have the capability to do good and bad things. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSSteerpike from Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast trilogy is charming, manipulative and callous. The world in which he lives is rigidly hierarchical, and no-one understands its intricacies better than Steerpike.  He is its natural product, and so feels entirely organic within the fantastical setting. He shows how crime stories can stretch into any genre or style.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Easy Rawlins from Walter Mosley’s novels is one of the all-time greats. He shares features of other hard-boiled detectives such as Philp Marlowe and Sam Spade, but his combination of weary humour and duty to his neighbours is unique. The Los Angeles setting, social complexity and sense of time passing make the characters feel like real people. And, of course, Easy has one of literature’s most appealing (and terrifying) sidekicks in Mouse, who can insert random violence into any situation.... MURDER WEAPONSSpoiler alert! In Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose, the murder weapon is the ink in a book of Aristotle’s Poetics. Victims are killed when they lick their fingers to turn the pages – punished for their philosophical curiosity. It provides the perfect example of a weapon connecting both to the motivation of the murderer and a key theme of the novel.     ... DEATH SCENESThe movie Reservoir Dogs directed by Quentin Tarantino contains a killing shocking for its contrariness. In a famous scene, a police officer is tortured and doused with petrol, but at the last second, his tormentor is shot. The audience, having rooted for the police officer, is relieved and expects him to be freed, but moments later he is dismissively murdered by another character. The scene disrupts the comfort of narrative flow. It tells the audience that anything can happen.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESMy absolute favourite is www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk, which contains thousands of archived newspapers. It’s the best place to get contemporaneous accounts of Victorian history, and also get a feel for the phrasing and intonations of that time. Many are brilliantly written, putting much of today’s journalism to shame, and some are hilarious. It’s a wonderfully human connection, I think, to laugh out loud while reading an article written in 1880.... WRITING TIPSWrite, write and then write some more. Write headlong and free, with no brake or throttle. And then edit brutally with your reader in mind. ... WRITING SNACKSA strong cup of Yorkshire Gold tea with milk – absolutely not the awful ‘Biscuit Brew’ flavour, which is a crime greater than anything I could think up.About ALEX REEVEAlex Reeve lives in Buckinghamshire and is a university lecturer, working on a PhD. The House on Half Moon Street is his debut, and the first in a series of books featuring Leo Stanhope.Find Alex Reeve on Twitter - @storyjoyAbout THE HOUSE ON HALF MOON STREETPublisher's descriptionEveryone has a secret...

{"title": "The Secrets You Hide by Kate Helm", "date": "Thursday 3 January 2019", "text": "The Secrets You HideBy Kate HelmPublished by Zaffre (Ebook - out now; Paperback  - 7 February 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionGeorgia Sage has a gift: she can see evil in people. As a courtroom artist she uses her skills to help condemn those who commit terrible crimes. After all, her own brutal past means she knows innocence is even rarer than justice. But when she is drawn back into the trial that defined her career, a case of twisted family betrayal, she realises her own reckless pursuit of justice may have helped the guilty go free.As Georgia gets closer to the truth behind the Slater family, something happens that threatens not only her career - but even her own sanity. At first, she fears her guilt around the events of her terrible childhood is finally coming back to haunt her. My verdictThe Secrets You Hide is a twisty psychological thriller filled with emotion and intrigue.This was (yet again) one of those books that I couldn't stop reading but really wanted to slow down to savour the writing. And it hooked me right from the very first page. The writing is compelling and easy to read, brilliantly bringing the characters and setting to life.The Secrets You Hide is an original and gripping addition to the psychological thriller genre. I've struggled with this genre recently, finding that so many books 'seem the same'. So I loved the unusual premise of using a courtroom artist as the protagonist.The book provided a fascinating insight into Georgia Sage's work and revealed how one person's 'first impressions' can influence the thoughts, actions and emotions of other people through a few simple brush strokes - and how they don't always get this right. Georgia has her own traumatic past to deal with - which has a strong influence on her work and also her relationships with the people around her. I found myself totally invested in her life, as she explored her past, fought her inner demons and thought about her future.I often spot twists and turns, but this book certainly managed to throw me off track in a couple of places, especially at the end. As everything clicked into place, I kicked myself (not literally, of course) for not connecting the dots sooner.A fantastic novel. Pre-order it!"},

{"title": "Snap by Belinda Bauer", "date": "Thursday 20 December 2018", "text": "SnapBy Belinda BauerPublished by Transworld (23 August 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalleyPublisher's descriptionSNAP DECISIONS CAN BE DANGEROUS . . . On a stifling summer's day, eleven-year-old Jack and his two sisters sit in their broken-down car, waiting for their mother to come back and rescue them. Jack's in charge, she'd said. I won't be long.But she doesn't come back. She never comes back. And life as the children know it is changed for ever.Three years later, Jack is still in charge - of his sisters, of supporting them all, of making sure nobody knows they're alone in the house, and - quite suddenly - of finding out the truth about what happened to his mother. . .My verdictYet again, Belinda Bauer has written an original, highly unsettling read about love and loss.Snap is more than just a police procedural/psychological thriller combination. While there's plenty of investigating going on, Snap is about the emotional impact of tragedy, with three abandoned children taking centre stage. Jack, the eldest, is trying to maintain some sense of normality, even though their world has fallen apart.The book is well written. It's a slow burner at first, to set the scene and introduce the characters, but eventually moves along at a cracking place. I love the mixture of darkness and humour - sad, tragic and funny at the same time. The multi-layered plot is a little far fetched, with plenty of police incompetence and coincidences, but it's also compelling, highly entertaining and very twisty.The children are portrayed realistically and their plight certainly pulled at the heartstrings - with Jack's alternative' parenting style and sense of duty towards his younger sisters creating some very funny moments. The police came across as caricatures, but I thought this fit in well with the nature of the book.Snap is a fun highly memorable crime novel - not to be taken completely seriously!"},

{"title": "Presumed Guilty by Jane Isaac", "date": "Monday 17 December 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Presumed Guilty by Jane Isaac. Read on for my review.Presumed GuiltyBy Jane IsaacPublished in ebook on 10th December 2018Publisher's' descriptionAccident or murder? The first victim – a prominent local councillor, killed in a hit and run ‒ could be either, but the next bodies leave no doubt. A twisted killer is at large. And he’s not finished yet. DC Beth Chamberlain, Family Liaison Officer, has to support the victims’ families, but before she can solve the crimes in the present, Beth needs to uncover the secrets of the past. Meanwhile, the killer has her in his sights... My verdictPresumed Guilty is another fabulous book from Jane Isaac, the second in her DC Beth Chamberlain series.A chilling prologue, followed by a hit and run, leads into a murder investigation. The plot moves at a cracking pace as the body count rises, with plenty of twisty trails for Beth to investigate. Jane Isaac is a great writer and certainly kept me on my toes. I love her evocative descriptions, which set the scenes and bring people and places to life without halting the pace of the action.Presumed Guilty is a police procedural, but there's so much more involved, including a family torn apart. With a Family Liaison Officer as the protagonist, it's not surprising that this is an emotional read. Beth gets right into the heart of the families involved, making the case feel very personal - to her and to me. Yet this character-led book also manages to be gritty and dark, with a serial killer on the loose.You could probably read Presumed Guilty as a standalone, but I would suggest reading After He's Gone first, to get to know Beth and understand her background.I can't wait for the next book in this series.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Storm Rising by Sara Driscoll", "date": "Friday 14 December 2018", "text": "Storm Risingby Sara DriscollPublished by Kensington Books (27 November 2018)Publisher's descriptionIn the wake of a devastating hurricane, Special Agent Meg Jennings and her Labrador, Hawk—invaluable members of the FBI’s Human Scent Evidence Team—have been deployed to Virginia Beach. They have their work cut out for them. Amid graveyards of debris, and the buried cries for help, the search and rescue operation begins. The most alarming discovery is yet to come—a teenage girl hiding in the Great Dismal Swamp. Shaken by the storm, she has reason to be scared. But this young survivor is terrified of so much more.Her name is Emma—a disheveled runaway lost to the sordid underbelly of a Virginia sex-trafficking ring. Its leader has disappeared in the chaos—along with other victims. With so much evidence, and so many witnesses, seemingly washed away, Meg joins forces with Special Agent Walter Van Cleave to ensure no further harm comes to their vulnerable charge. They soon discover that this is no small-time localized syndicate. Its branches are rooted in some of the most influential powers in Virginia. Now as Meg’s investigation digs deeper, she’s making some very dangerous enemies. And one by one, they’re coming out of the storm to stop her.My verdictI loved this book! Those four words sum up my entire review - so I don't really need to write anything else! But I will.Storm Rising focuses on the devastating impact of floods following a hurricane and the discovery of a sex-trafficking ring involving young teenage girls. It's well researched (as always), with plenty of background into the K-9 search-and-rescue team and also disaster management and crime investigations. The book includes some interesting facts at the start of each chapter. This is great for me, as I love to learn something new when I read.Storm Rising is well written and well plotted - I whizzed through it fairly quickly - with an amazing sense of place, thanks to the vivid descriptions of the floods. It kept me interested and entertained all the way through. The topic is very timely, with US floods (and also fires) in the media spotlight. The book highlights the impact of natural disasters on everyone involved, from those who lose their homes to those responding in an emergency.Meg is a brilliant main character - although I think Hawk the dog is really the one in the limelight in this series. You could easily read this book as a standalone, but I would suggest you read the previous two books as well, to build up the characters and the dynamics between them."},

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Rebecca Griffiths", "date": "Thursday 6 December 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome REBECCA GRIFFITHSto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSThis is a difficult one ...  John Fowles, Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan, Roald Dahl, Ruth Rendell, John Harvey to name but a few ...  but if really pushed, I’d have to say, Friedrich Durrenmatt. His book The Pledge is one I return to time and again. For its atmospheric settings and scenes that play like a musical accompaniment to the dramatic storytelling that leads the reader to the shocker of an ending. It is a study of obsession and the precarious balance which exists between good and evil - in a nutshell, I admire Durrenmatt as a writer because he creates excitement and tension by quiet and simple means.    ... FILMS/MOVIESAnother difficult one! There are so many, and my favourite genre in film has to be a great court room drama like: To Kill a Mockingbird, The Accused, Reversal of Fortune. But, if pushed, the absolute standout film in the crime/thriller genre for me has to be, Gorky Park (written by Dennis Potter, from a Martin Cruz Smith novel, and directed by Michael Apted). I first saw this film in my late teens, and have watched it many times since. The most striking thing for me, is that it hasn’t dated, and is as absorbing, chilling and fresh today as it was 35 years ago.  From the gruesome opening scene, when three murder victims are found in Moscow’s Gorky Park without their faces or fingertips, it creates an immediate intensity that’s sustained throughout by a cast of characters you care about who unearth a network of deceit and intrigue. In essence, this is a taut and clever psychological plot entwined in a tender love story. Haunting and bleak and moody, it is strangely riveting without need for endless shootouts, car chases or elaborate special effects.  ... TV DRAMASThe Strike Series (from the books by Robert Galbraith). Private Detective Cormorant Strike and his assistant, Robin Ellacott, are so terrifically drawn and believable, it’s difficult to pull your eyes away from the screen. Fundamentally, what makes them interesting to me, is they are, both of them, wounded; either physically or psychologically, or both, and I find I don’t really care about the crime they are solving (although the crimes are thrilling) - what I love, is the absorbing and touching way these two interact with one another. They truly are a fabulous duo, and I can’t wait for the next book in the series, Lethal White (published September 2018) to be televised.... FICTIONAL KILLERSJack Vance (created by Val McDermid). A TV celebrity with a secret lust for torture, murder and underage girls.  Wire in the Blood was published in 1997, but what echoes it has with what went on to be revealed about Jimmy Saville after his death in 2011. Chilling, doesn’t come near it. ‘Who knew?’ - it’s a question I’m waiting to ask Val McDermid. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Detective Inspector Charlie Resnick (created by John Harvey). A sensitive, intelligent and three-dimensional character, that Harvey goes on to develop throughout the series of books. Resnick has become so real in my head, I can go to town and see him drinking his strong, black Polish coffee at a café in the undercover market, a blob of mayonnaise on his tie!... MURDER WEAPONSI have to say, it’s more the 'why' rather than the 'how' that interests m The steady unravelling of the human psyche, and how personal backgrounds and prejudices influence actions ... that can evolve to become deadly actions.      ... DEATH SCENESLamb to the Slaughter (1953) is a short story by Roald Dahl. *spoiler alert* ... The story was supposedly suggested to Dahl by his friend Ian Fleming: \"Why don't you have someone murder their husband with a frozen leg of mutton, which she then serves to the detectives who come to investigate the crime?\"Brilliant! ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI like trawling through Facebook and Twitter. It’s often where I find my characters’ names and information on the lives they lead and the jobs they do - social media sites provide an amazing treasure trove of goodies, as they shine a rather bold, unerring, if not unintended light into the warped workings of the human mind!... WRITING TIPSJust do it.... WRITING SNACKSI try not to! Limiting myself to mugs of hot black tea and the odd rhubarb and custard sweet until it’s deemed a decent hour in the day for a large gin and tonic!  About REBECCA GRIFFITHSRebecca Griffiths grew up in rural mid-Wales and went on to gain a first class honours degree in English Literature.

{"title": "Attend by West Camel", "date": "Monday 3 December 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for Attend by West Camel. Attend is published by Orenda Books. Read on for my review...AttendBy West CamelPublished by Orenda Books (Ebook - out now; Paperback - 13 December 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhen Sam falls in love with Deptford thug Derek, and Anne’s best friend Kathleen takes her own life, they discover they are linked not just by a world of drugs and revenge; they also share the friendship of the uncanny and enigmatic Deborah.Seamstress, sailor, story-teller and self-proclaimed centenarian immortal, Deborah slowly reveals to Anne and Sam her improbable, fantastical life, a history of hidden Deptford and ultimately the solution to their crises.With echoes of Armistead Maupin, Attend is a beautifully written, darkly funny, mesmerisingly emotive and deliciously told debut novel, rich in finely wrought characters that you will never forget.My verdictAttend is a novel of threads - gritty and dark, tender and light, mysterious and magical - just like the three threads featured on its cover. It's a book of past and present, grief and tragedy, forgiveness and redemption, and hopes and dreams. It's about the uncertainty of life and the unpredictability of the future.The book features three lonely people - former drug addict Anne who has been estranged from her family for years, young Sam who is in love with a local thug, and the elderly and very eccentric Deborah who claims she can never die. All three strands gradually intertwine as these three people's paths and lives collide.Attend reads like a soap opera with emotion at its core, featuring the diverse tapestry of life in south-east London. This book is very surreal in places, yet it's also filled with harshness of modern day real life. The realistic dialogue is interspersed with astute observations of characters' appearances and mannerisms. And thanks to the vivid descriptive writing, Deptford (old and new) leaps off the page - I could picture it, smell it, feel it and hear it.I found myself reading slowly, out loud (under my breath mainly so I didn't annoy members of the household) to savour the gorgeous prose - especially Deborah's chapters, as she recounts stories of her past, through the decades of her life.Just as the story features an intricate sampler, Attend IS an intricate piece of work, showing off author West Camel's skill in weaving words and phrases together to create a great debut novel.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Outside looking in: A 2018 Chanukah update", "date": "Sunday 2 December 2018", "text": "This morning I went on a doughnut (donut) run. I originally wrote this post a year ago. But with Chanukah beginning tonight, it seems relevant to post it again - with an update and some extra photos.Christmas: Outside looking inAt this time of year I sometimes feel like a trespasser. A ghostly apparition peering through a smudged window into a tinsel-draped world I'm not really part of.On the outside looking in. Here, but not here.I watch the fervent build up and read frantic discussions on social media from the sidelines. Present buying. Christmas trees. Delicious festive treats. Large family meals. I don't join in, but that doesn't mean I don't understand your stress and excitement. I have my fair share during the year, with the weekly Jewish Sabbath and several Jewish festivals (with a strong focus on food!).I've never celebrated Christmas. During my childhood, December 25th was simply a family day, with a large lunch, as there was little else to do. No Christmas tree. No presents. No Christmas pudding. We would still eat turkey though, along with home-made stuffing, brussels sprouts and minced pies. I remember Christmas crackers on the table and watching festive TV. After all, that's what everyone did at 'this time of year'.I knew all about Christmas, don't get me wrong. I had plenty of friends who celebrated it - non-Jewish ones and Jewish ones - and I didn't go to a Jewish school. I didn't take part in the annual Nativity play but would watch the rehearsals from the sidelines, learning the songs and the lines, just as I watch the build up to Christmas now. I didn't go to the school carol services either (we had a day off instead - shopping or cinema, if I remember right, though we were probably meant to do school work(!)). Yet I knew all of the carols anyway.I guess not much has changed.For me, this time of year has always been about Chanukah (Hanukkah), the Jewish festival of lights, which lasts for eight days. A festival of miracles and hope and joy. Unlike Christmas, Chanukah doesn't occur on a set date each year, as it's determined by the Hebrew calendar. One year, it may be in November, and the next year in December. This year it begins on 2nd December - Sunday evening -  as soon as darkness falls.In keeping with tradition, each night we will light candles on a nine-branched Menorah (also called a Chanukiah), an extra candle each night (with the ninth candle called a Shamash (helper) to light the others).So one candle on the first night, two on the second and so on, until all eight candles are twinkling in a row. The candles symbolise a miracle in the second century BCE, when a handful of Jews defeated the Greeks to reclaim back their Holy Land and rededicated the Second Temple in Jerusalem. When they wanted to light the Temple's Menorah, there was only enough oil for one day - yet miraculously the oil lasted for eight days, known as the miracle of Chanukah.There's a whole Rugrats episode devoted to this!At Chanukah, it's traditional to eat fried foods - especially donuts and latkes (fried potato pancakes like rosti) - and to play a game with a dreidel (a four-sided spinning top) for coins, nuts or chocolate.We can buy Chanukah biscuits (including candle or dreidel shaped ones) too.Chanukah is often associated with presents, but that's not a Jewish tradition so I assume it's the influence of Christmas. We give money called Chanukah gelt (or chocolate coins) to children, as well as to charity. You can now buy Chanukah decorations, as sparkly as the Christmas ones, and lots of crazy Chanukah-themed items.Even Chanukah socks this year (no, I didn't buy them).As a child, I would receive one Chanukah present each night (some small, some large), as did my two boys when they were younger. Now they are teenagers, the eight-present tradition has faded away in our house. But not the candle lighting - never that.Chanukah is also a time for community, with activities and celebrations at our Synagogue. This year we will have another interfaith event with the local church - our Rabbi will light a large Menorah as the vicar beside him switches on Christmas tree lights. There will be Jewish songs and carol singers. There will be mulled wine and minced pies and kosher donuts for the children.Some people worry they'll offend me if they wish me Happy Christmas. But not at all. When I say I'm on the outside looking in, I don't mean this in a negative way. I enjoy watching friends building up to their big event of the year - my Twitter and Facebook feeds are filled with that positivity. After the last few years of world politics (and Brexit on the horizon), we all need plenty of that.People who know I'm writing fiction often ask me what I'm writing. I'm usually suitably vague and don't say much about what I'm doing or what stage I'm at. But the truth is that I'm writing Jewish-themed crime fiction, set in a fictional multi-cultural town in Hertfordshire, UK. I'm very open about my Jewish heritage and proud of it too. My book also happens to be set at this time of year - Chanukah and Christmas season.Last year, I wrote in the original post that I planned to finish this WIP in 2018. Erm... well... that hasn't quite gone to plan! But I am getting closer to finishing my second draft. If I'm a little quiet on social media, or Off-the-Shelf Books seems to be taking a few days off, assume that I'm editing or writing, or both, when I'm not busy working. Feel free to give me a virtual kick (or just a message will do) from time to time, to make sure I am!I'm hoping that one day you'll get a chance to read my novel (if you want to) and learn more about Jewish traditions, the worrying rise of anti-semitism in the UK (what it's like to experience it for real 'on the frontline', not what you read in the newspapers) and the huge sense of family and community spirit that I know so well.Thank you for reading to the end of this non-bookish post and for supporting Off-the-Shelf Books, which turns four on 30th December 2018.I wish you all a Happy Christmas, Happy Chanukah or whatever you're celebrating within the next month. And a Happy New Year too."},
{"title": "A House of Ghosts by W. C. Ryan", "date": "Thursday 29 November 2018", "text": "A House of GhostsBy W. C. RyanPublished by Zaffre (4 October 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWinter 1917. As the First World War enters its most brutal phase, back home in England, everyone is seeking answers to the darkness that has seeped into their lives.At Blackwater Abbey, on an island off the Devon coast, Lord Highmount has arranged a spiritualist gathering to contact his two sons who were lost in the conflict. But as his guests begin to arrive, it gradually becomes clear that each has something they would rather keep hidden. Then, when a storm descends on the island, the guests will find themselves trapped. Soon one of their number will die.For Blackwater Abbey is haunted in more ways than one . . .My verdictI loved this spooky book, with its wartime theme, haunted house and claustrophobic Island setting.House of Ghosts is an old-fashioned ghost story set in 1917, mixed with Christie-type classic crime and espionage. It's grim, dark and chilling, highlighting the mental and physical scars of the returning soldiers and the grief of the families of those who didn't return from the war at all.Here, you have a locked room scenario, with an authentic array of characters trapped on a windswept island off the Devon coastline, a murderer among them. There are grieving hosts, dubious clairvoyants, dedicated staff and some unexpected house guests. The two main characters, Kate and Donovan, investigate lies and deception, murder and sabotage. The house, Blackwater Abbey, is a character in its own right, with its ghostly corridors, secret passages and tunnels and creaky floorboards.Short snappy chapters keep the storyline moving at a fast pace, with lots of cliffhangers, heart-pounding moments and surprises in store. I was having such a great time reading this murder mystery that I really didn't want it to end. Despite its unsettling nature, the book is filled with humour, creating an enjoyable atmospheric read. I don't know if this is the start of a series. But I'm hoping there will be another book featuring Kate and Donovan, with more espionage and ghostly goings-on.Perfect for dark stormy nights, as well as cold winter one!"},
{"title": "Susi Holliday's spooky holiday snaps! ", "date": "Friday 23 November 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for The Lingering by S.J.I. (Susi) Holliday. I love looking at Susi's holiday posts on social media, as she's been to some fascinating (and often scary-looking) places. So I asked her if she would share some of her spookiest destinations on Off-the-Shelf Books today. The Lingering was published by Orenda Books on 15 November 2018.Susi Holliday's spooky holiday snaps!Growing up near Edinburgh, there was never any shortage of eerie places to discover in my youth – the old town streets are oozing with dark history, especially Mary King’s Close - the street full of plague victims that was blocked off – while all the inhabitants were still alive; and Greyfriars Kirkyard – the most haunted graveyard in the world – where George ‘Bloody’ Mackenzie imprisoned the covenanters and left them there to die. So, with that morbid history imprinted on me from the start, it’s no great surprise that I developed a fascination with the creepy and macabre on my travels… here’s a small selection of my favourites.A scary Mexican saloonNo Scum Allowed Saloon’ – a bar in White Oaks, New Mexico. Once a mining community, and now officially a ghost town, this place was once frequented by Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett. We stayed in a dilapidated mobile home on an old rock mine… and didn’t sleep a wink. Eerie desert sandsOn the same trip, we visited White Sands National Monument – an eerie desert of gypsum and calcium sands, bordering the White Sands Missile Range, where they tested the first atomic bomb.Haunting Chinese memorialNanjing Massacre Museum, China – a haunting place filled with the bones of the dead. I found out about it after reading Mo Hayder’s book ‘Tokyo’ and became fascinated by a dark period of history that I had previously known nothing about. This led me to read Iris Chang’s book ‘The Rape of Nanking’ – and it was only when I saw the memorial to her here that I found out that she had committed suicide two years earlier, purportedly haunted by her research.Statues of remembranceJizo Statues, Kamakura, Japan – another thing I learned about in Mo Hayder’s book – these are statues to remember unborn babies. It is believed that as the babies did not have the chance to build up good karma on earth, Jizo helps smuggle the children into the afterlife in the sleeves of his robe. Beautiful concept, but chilling, nonetheless.Gothic Yorkshire ruins Whitby Abbey, Yorkshire – classic gothic pilgrimage spot, famous for being the place where Dracula came ashore as ‘a large dog’ and proceeded to climb the 199 steps which lead up to the ruins. The steps are a bit of a challenge, but it’s a must-do to get the full experience. There’s a youth hostel attached to the abbey, which is still on my ‘must-stay’ list.Dracula's Transylvanian castleBran Castle, Transylvania – the famous ‘Dracula’s Castle’ – very difficult to get to, and while it’s a fascinating place, the journey there via a (possibly) psychotic Romanian taxi driver was more frightening than Bram Stoker’s book, the true story of Vlad the Impaler, and the tourist-eating brown bears that roam the mountains, all put together.Czech church of bonesKutna Hora Ossuary, Czech Republic – a church full of bones, apparently decorated by a mad monk… again, while the place itself was quite eerie, it was far more chilling walking the streets of this almost deserted town in the Czech countryside.Creepy Cornwall moorsThe Jamaica Inn, Bodmin Moor, Cornwall – nothing much to report during the day, although walking across the moor in the fog is quite an experience – but come night-time, when the bus parties of cream-tea tourists have departed, this place is more than a little creepy… another place where I didn’t sleep a wink!            About S.J.I.

Well, he's now written a standalone literary novel, also set in exotic locations such as Africa and the Caribbean. But before I show you the cover of Turbulent Wake, you must read the blurb. *drum roll*Turbulent Wake: Read the blurbEthan Scofield returns to the place of his birth to bury his father. Hidden in one of the upstairs rooms of the old man’s house he finds a strange manuscript, a collection of stories that seems to cover the whole of his father’s turbulent life. As his own life starts to unravel, Ethan works his way through the manuscript, trying to find answers to the mysteries that have plagued him since he was a child. What happened to his little brother? Why was his mother taken from him? And why, in the end, when there was no one else left, did his own father push him away?  Swinging from the coral cays of the Caribbean to the dangerous deserts of Yemen and the wild rivers of Africa, Turbulent Wake is a bewitching, powerful and deeply moving story of love and loss ... of the indelible damage we do to those closest to us and, ultimately, of the power of redemption in a time of change.Sound great? It certainly does! I can't wait to read it - Paul's writing is outstandingand his books are filled with emotion. AND NOW.... *drum roll*Are you ready????Turbulent Wake: View the coverI love this cover! You know how a picture speaks a thousand words? Well I can't wait to read the thousands of words behind this one! It's SO moody - calm on the surface but hiding plenty of trouble (just look at that stormy sky!). Plus what's behind the mist? A search into the unknown, perhaps?

{"title": "Changeling by Matt Wesolowski", "date": "Thursday 15 November 2018", "text": "ChangelingBy Matt WesolowskiPublished by Orenda Books (Ebook - 15 November 2018; Paperback - 15 January 2019)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher’s descriptionOn Christmas Eve in 1988, seven-year-old Alfie Marsden vanished in the Wentshire Forest Pass, when a burst tyre forced his father, Sorrel, to stop the car. Leaving the car to summon the emergency services, Sorrel returned to find his son gone. No trace of the child, nor his remains, have ever been found. Alfie Marsden was declared officially dead in 1995.Elusive online journalist, Scott King, whose ‘Six Stories’ podcasts have become an internet sensation, investigates the disappearance, interviewing six witnesses, including Sorrel, his son and his ex-partner, to try to find out what really happened that fateful night. He takes a journey through the trees of the Wentshire Forest – a place synonymous with strange sightings, and tales of hidden folk who dwell there. He talks to a company that tried and failed to build a development in the forest, and a psychic who claims to know where Alfie is…My verdictA missing child, a grieving father, a neglectful alcoholic mother, things that go tap tap tap in the night, local folklore, creepy forests... Plus gripping writing, authentic dialogue, heart-pounding tension and a final twist that I seriously didn’t see coming!Yes, as you may have guessed, I loved Changeling.I read this book in around 2.5 hours, unable to tear myself away. Pretty impressive, considering I was going through a major reading slump at the time, unable to find a book to maintain my concentration. It takes a lot for a book to 'scare' me so I don't have a problem reading these books alone at night, when everyone else has gone to bed. But Changeling is very very unsettling, and I found myself gripping the pages tightly as I read - and then jumped when a door banged somewhere in the house. Changeling explores of the case of seven-year-old Alfie Marsden, who went missing in a forest in 1988, after slipping out, or being taken from, the car while his father investigated a strange tapping sound. The young boy hasn't been seen since, dead or alive.Changeling is definitely my favourite of the three Six Stories books so far. I'm not sure if that’s down to the emotional subject matter, chilling storyline or overall creepiness of the prose. All three books feel very real, from the array of believable characters to the atmospheric settings. In fact, part of me is convinced that these are genuine cases and genuine podcasts and that Matt Wesolowski has a secret life as a crime podcaster (which means he IS his character).To explain, if you haven't read a Six Stories book before, all three of the books are written in a unique format - six podcasts hosted by elusive online journalist Scott King who is exploring cold cases. The podcasts are all very dark, highly thought-provoking and intriguing, as each new character reveals snippets of information about the case, building the tension, intensifying the suspense and layering the mystery at the heart of the story.You could easily read Changeling as a stand-alone. But I would recommend reading all three books anyway. They’re all brilliant, very different despite following the same format and prove that Matt Weselowski is one of the best emerging horror/crime writers in the present day.Bring on the next one! (I hope there is a next one...)"},
{"title": "Somewhere Beyond the Sea by Miranda Dickinson", "date": "Wednesday 14 November 2018", "text": "Somewhere Beyond the SeaBy Miranda DickinsonPublished by Pan (14 June 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionCan you fall in love with someone before you’ve even met?Seren MacArthur is living a life she never intended. Trying to save the Cornish seaside business her late father built – while grieving for his loss – she has put her own dreams on hold and is struggling. Until she discovers a half-finished seaglass star on her favourite beach during an early morning walk. When she completes the star, she sets into motion a chain of events that will steal her heart and challenge everything she believes.Jack Dixon is trying to secure a better life for daughter Nessie and himself. Left a widower and homeless when his wife died, he’s just about keeping their heads above water. Finding seaglass stars completed on Gwithian beach is a bright spark that slowly rekindles his hope.Seren and Jack are searching for their missing pieces. But when they meet in real life, it’s on the opposing sides of a battle. Jack is managing the redevelopment of a local landmark, and Seren is leading the community campaign to save it.Both have reason to fight – Seren for the cause her father believed in, Jack for his livelihood. But only one can win. With so much at stake, will they ever find what they are really looking for?My verdictSomewhere Beyond the Sea was as magical and sparkly as the seaglass that features heavily within the story.This is a book about family and grief, love and friendship, with a strong heartwarming 'feel good' focus. It provided me with a much-needed break from my usual crime fiction reads at the time. It's sad and moving yet also uplifting and hopeful - a sweet and poignant read that reminded me of a Meg Ryan film, a cross between You've Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle.I loved the Cornish setting, and author Miranda Dickinson really brings the location and characters to life with her vivid descriptions. Jack and Seren narrate alternative chapters so I got to know both of them very well, which meant I then cared strongly about the story. I could almost smell the sea and hear the waves, as I imagined myself walking along the beaches in search of seaglass stars.A perfect book for cold evenings snuggled under a blanket (with a glass of wine and box of chocolates). And yes, it made me shed a few tears by the end!"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Merle Nygate", "date": "Monday 12 November 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome MERLE NYGATEto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSJohn le Carré – he can’t be beaten. Graham Greene and Len Deighton.  Can I have all three?I’m not at all sure I can choose between them. They span the Cold War which fascinates me even though my novel, The Righteous Spy is contemporary. I suppose my fascination with the Cold War goes back to school.  When I was 15 we learnt about the Berlin Wall; the idea that there was a wall in the middle of a city and that half the city was associated with a different country was so ridiculous that I thought I must have misunderstood what the teacher was saying.... FILMS/MOVIESAt the moment my favourite film is Imperium.  I watched it recently and thought Daniel Radcliffe as FBI undercover agent, Nat Foster was remarkable. Radcliffe plays both an American nerdy FBI agent and a convincing supremacist when his character infiltrates far right groups.  It’s a very human piece showing the different sides’ vulnerabilities.  Based on an account written by an FBI agent it has the literary ring of truth.  On reflection, the film would probably have worked better as TV.... TV DRAMASThe Wire is the best TV show I’ve ever seen. I watch it every few years and each time I notice something new.  Again, this is a well-researched piece. David Simon wrote a book called Homicide, A Year on the Killing Streets.  David Simon knows this world as a former journalist and it is a brilliant series full of psychological insight and nuance, not to mention terrific drama; think Shakespeare. It’s best to watch it with subtitles because the slang is difficult to understand until you get into it. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSDix in Dorothy M Hughes’ In a Lonely Place.  Although Dix is pretty creepy, this book and the author were a discovery for me when I did my MA in Crime Fiction at UEA. The title was on the reading list and before then I’d never heard of Hughes.  Dix is a psychopath who stalks women in Los Angeles. He’s not unlike Ripley in Highsmith’s books but Dix stalking the swirling mists of post war Los Angeles is brilliantly realised. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES My abiding fondness for Sherlock Holmes is because he was the first detective I ever read and the stories still work.  I love Holme’s analytical and deductive skills and there’s some of that in Petra; one of the characters in The Righteous Spy.  What’s more, when it came out, the TV adaptation with Jeremy Brett was the highlight of the viewing week and it was the best TV ever. ... FICTIONAL SPIESBernard Samson is a great spy.  He’s in the nine-book series by Len Deighton that starts with Berlin Game. Like The Wire, it’s a series I re-read every few years. Samson is an outsider in MI6 and he is wonderfully irreverent.  He has a great sense of humour which I think is an important attribute for a spy and he’s his own man.     ... MURDER WEAPONS Opiates would be my favourite weapon because I am a wimp when it comes to pain and opiates are said to be about as painless a murder weapon as possible.   ... DEATH SCENESAlex Leamus and Liz Gold at The Berlin Wall in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  I like it because the entire way through the book I was expecting them to survive, to get over the wall – and then they don’t. It’s such a vivid scene and so tragic but it is the only possible ending.BLOGS/WEBSITESThe CIA website is packed with ideas for spy writers.  I came across the website when I was researching The Righteous Spy and desperately looking for a potential story. By that stage, I’d written about nine outlines for various ideas and none of them were convincing and they seemed derivative which they were, being based on other spy stories. On the CIA website I came across a review for a non-fiction book called Gideon’s Spies by Gordon Thomas.  It was described as the inside story of Mossad and included interviews with former directors and intelligence officers. This book was the turning point for me. I close read, marked it up, made detailed notes and extrapolated the information I needed for a second document.  From that document I brainstormed and identified the various different types of true espionage stories.  For example, there seem to be different types of assassinations; revenge assassinations in the aftermath of terrorist attacks; strategic assassinations to kill enemy nuclear scientists; liaison assassinations where Mossad may kill on behalf of another intelligence service; warning assassinations when an arms dealer is wounded or killed as a warning to other arms dealers.  There were also disinformation and recruitment operations that had rich fictional possibilities and, of course, the ubiquitous, ‘find the mole’ story. From the list of documented operations, I brainstormed 13 different one-sentence scenarios before narrowing them down to the ideas that eventually became The Righteous Spy.My other favourite website is The National Archives. It’s another treasure trove of stories and the bookshop is a great source of non-fiction spy books.... WRITING TIPSDecide your theme and develop your characters before you hit the page.  That’s my process which I wouldn’t want to impose on anyone else, but it works for me. Although I didn’t have a story until I did the research, I knew that I wanted to write about good people doing bad things.  For me knowing the theme of a story is like a compass, or maybe a torch in the dark; it gives me something to get back to and shows me the way ahead if I get lost. So, I always start a piece of work asking myself the ‘What’s it about?’ question.  The second stage is understanding the characters, who they are and what they want. ... WRITING SNACKSApples, nuts and a lot of water.  Chocolate and coffee for short bursts.  From time to time the chocolate and coffee habit can get somewhat out of control!About MERLE NYGATEMerle Nygate is a screenwriter, script editor, screenwriting lecturer and novelist; she’s worked on BAFTA winning TV, New York Festival audio drama and written original sitcoms; previously she worked for BBC Comedy Commissioning as well as writing and script editing across multiple genres.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Will Carver", "date": "Friday 9 November 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome WILL CARVERfor his Good Samaritans blog tourto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSI’m playing catch-up on a lot of the recent crop of crime writers but I loved Simone Buchholtz’s Blue Night. My first toe in the water came from Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr Ripley and that has (obviously) been a tough act to follow. I really enjoyed David Jackson’s Callum Doyle series - Pariah, Marked, The Helper. They were wonderfully quirky and funny and smart. I look forward to reading Don’t Make A Sound. But, for me, the best is Sarah Pinborough. I think she probably throws away ideas that are better than most of the things out there. And she can write anything. Crime, horror, erotic fairytales… I enjoy the fact that they are different. Crime plus weird. Behind Her Eyes was a deserved and long overdue hit but if you haven’t read them, you should go back and try The Death House, The Language of Dying and her Dog-Faced Gods trilogy.... FILMS/MOVIESWhen I think of the crime films I like they are very different to the crime that I write. I like American gangster movies like The Godfather or Mean Streets, and any kind of courtroom drama. I don’t think I could write something like that but I love to watch them. For some reason, the first film that came into my head was Primal Fear. And I think it was even better because the first time I watched it, I had no idea about the twist at the end. I would’ve been looking out for that all the way through and it would have tainted the viewing. It was a real sucker punch because I usually guess these things.... TV DRAMASThis took me no time to consider. X-Files. Great writing - the best coming from Carter and Spotnitz. People often say that they liked the first season and then it started to get ridiculous. That’s usually when I start swearing at them. That first season was a worldwide phenomenon - and rightly so. It was scary and thought-provoking and funny and tense. It had everything. One-off comedy episodes and procedural episodes. But it was all the mythology episodes that kept me hooked, the governmental conspiracies and just what happened to Samantha Mulder. For six years, each new season was better than the last. I remember watching all of season six in one day, on video. It’s the best one. It has the two-part Dreamland story and the Two Fathers/One Son double-hitter. Amazing. (Think I could name almost every episode off the top of my head.) And the characters were iconic. Mulder. Scully. Deepthroat. X. Lone Gunmen. Cigarette Smoking Man. Krycek. Skinner. Eugene Tooms. Then they bring in John Doggett to replace the missing Mulder in season eight. And you think you’ll hate him and it’s going to be rubbish. But he’s brilliant in a totally different way and you still love the show. And Scully is better, too. I think there’s something for every kind of crime fan in this show and the level of writing never lessens, even if season nine turned out to be a heartbreaking anti-climax. But that is being rectified with the new episodes.... FICTIONAL KILLERSIt’s hard to decide between my two favourites. Patrick Bateman and Hannibal Lecter. There is something so compelling about a pure psychopath. That complete lack of empathy and guilt. That they have a way of forming a relationship - often adversarial - but you know they would kill that person they seemingly respect without thinking about it. But what I like about these is that they are so unapologetically psychotic but they are also suave and smart and, though you know you shouldn’t, you kind of like them and maybe even want them to get away with it. It messes with your head. That’s why they are the best.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Part of me doesn’t want to say Sherlock Holmes because it seems too obvious. But I like him for many of the same reasons that I like Bateman or Lecter. He’s the smartest and he knows he is. He can be mean and tactless but you still like him. The books are great, the TV show is great and the films are pretty good, too. It comes from the writing, of course, but it is the character that makes it. Still, I’d have to put him in second place behind the unforgettable Dale Cooper. He’s intelligent and individual and unorthodox. To stand out as a bit weird in a place like Twin Peaks is not easy. It’s his heart and morals that draw you into the character, though. He’s the outsider, the city guy drawn into a country town with a seedy underbelly. And he embraces the community. He talks to the Log Lady like she’s anybody else in the world. That’s what makes the final minute of the show what it is. It’s Dale Cooper and how much we are all routing for him.... MURDER WEAPONSThere’s an episode of X-Files called Soft Light. A scientist is caught up in a freak accident while experimenting and anyone who comes into contact with his shadow dematerialises. He doesn’t want to kill anyone but he can’t help it. A unique murder weapon, I’d say.    ... DEATH SCENESThe opening of the French film Irreversible is a chaotic spiral of a journey that ends with some guy getting beaten to death with a fire extinguisher. It all looks like it’s done in one shot. But the brutality of the way his face is crushed is just horrifying. But the scene that lived with me is from American History X. And you don’t even see the victim die. Derek Vinyard - played by Edward Norton, who should’ve won the Oscar that year, despite Roberto Benigni’s excellent performance in Life is Beautiful - catches someone trying to rob his house. He takes him down to the road, at gunpoint, forces him to the floor and instructs him to, ‘Put your fucking teeth on the kerb’. Then you see him lift his foot above the burglar’s head and you hear the burglar’s teeth scraping against the kerb, and then it cuts to black as Vinyard starts to bring his foot down. It will haunt you. Utterly horrifying and angry and brutal. I watched that film six times at the cinema… Nothing has come close to that death scene. And then I saw Vince Vaughn in Brawl in Cell Block 99 and there are about twelve deaths that are equal to or worse than either of the ones I have mentioned. It was not the film I was expecting at all.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESA couple of books ago I fell down a rabbit hole when I found a website where you could read police interview transcripts and listen to interview tapes. But now, I use YouTube as one of my main research aids. (When starting a new idea.) It’s great to pick up soundbites and old interviews or news pieces. If you want to know about serial killers, you can get lost in some of the clips they have. What I love most is that you can get hold of things that aren’t on DVD or iTunes or whatever. They might be old or were never popular or were made on a low budget so even back when they were made you had to search for them. Recently I’ve watched a 9-hour documentary on the siege at Waco. I’ve done a couple of hours delving into the Jonestown massacre. I watched 12 minutes of interviews from former members of Heaven’s Gate. And that’s before you find all the spin-offs. I think it’s a wonderfully varied and accessible way to build up an understanding of something. I’ve been using it to get a feel for my latest book, while developing an idea of the motivation behind the central character. I wouldn’t suggest writing an entire book based on what you find on YouTube but it’s a valuable online resource when starting out with an idea and you’ll quickly get to know whether you want to pursue it any further.... WRITING TIPSIgnore writing tips. I start writing at midnight. Don’t do that. It’s shit. Unless it works for you because you can’t sleep and the idea of getting up at 6am to hammer out word fills you with dread. I edit as I go along. Don’t do that. It’s stupid. It breaks up the flow. Unless that works for you because you hate editing a book once it’s written and you want your first draft to be as close as possible to the final draft. I’d rather tidy up 2,000 words of mess at a time than wade through 90,000 words just because I had to get an idea down. Some writers plot every chapter and some put more focus into character. Some people think NaNoWriMo is a great idea and others think that style is horse shit. Find what works for you.If you look after twins all day and get no respite until 6pm, it doesn’t matter if you’re a morning person, you’ll probably have to become a night writer. Even though you’re shattered. If you want to smash out a book in a month, you are not going to be an edit-along-the-way kinda writer. So don’t do it. Don’t be half-arsed because it will come across in your writing. Write what excites you. If it turns you on to write about vampires fucking and sucking each other’s necks, do it. If you love drilling down into the minute procedures of a police investigation, do it. And do it with vigour. Because the reader can (usually) tell. One tip that I think is worthwhile is don’t ask for feedback from somebody who loves you. It’s so unfair to put that pressure on them. And your parent/sibling/partner is never going to tell you that you’re rubbish and you shouldn’t ask them to. Find someone who will tell you the truth. Stephen King doesn’t type ‘The End’ and the book goes to print, he needs somebody to tell him the parts that are crap. And then he has to fix them. My parting words, my writing tip: Do something else. If you can. Anything else. Because it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. It’s not what you think. Last year Good Samaritans was getting rejected for being too dark or not literary enough or not having a strong female character(?) and I was sat at home selling my computer on eBay so that I could afford some lentils. Don’t that. It’s crazy. Unless that works for you. Because you’re not scared by that idea. Then, as Hemingway said, you need to ‘Sit at that typewriter (laptop) and bleed’.... WRITING SNACKSI write so late that this isn’t really a thing for me. I can’t have coffee at that time so I tend to have water or whisky. And I’ll try to not eat or only have fruit because I’ve done all my eating for the day. People who stay up late tend to consume 500 more calories per day than those who got to bed at a ‘normal’ time. So be careful if you enjoy cake or biscuits while you are writing, if you’re a night owl. Writer’s arse is a real thing.About WILL CARVERWill Carver is the international bestselling author of the January David series (Arrow).

FILMS/MOVIESSe7en. A killer uses the seven deadly sins against his victims, sounds like just another serial killer thriller but there’s a wicked twist and some beautiful use of character. What’s in the box?... TV DRAMASBroadchurch. Aside from the David Tennant factor, Broadchurch was one of the nation’s biggest water cooler TV dramas in years. I loved it for the tight, claustrophobic feeling for the small town where everyone has something to hide. It’s not even a particularly original theme, young boy is killed… whodunnit, but an amazing cast and perfect setting set it apart from the rest. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSGretchen Lowell. A beautiful but deadly serial killer who manages to infiltrate the investigation looking for her and make the lead detective fall madly in lust with her. If it wasn’t for the killing people aspect I’d totally want to be her. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Dr Gideon Fell. I feel like Dr Fell is one of the most underestimated detectives in fiction. Although I’m cheating a little here – he’s not a real detective in the sense that he works for the police force but then again neither was Sherlock Holmes, was he? Gideon Fell has all the ingenuity of Mr Holmes, just without the recognition. ... MURDER WEAPONSUmbrella spike. I picture a debonair killer in a smoking jacket, played by Tom Hardy, killing people with a very sharp ended black umbrella. Perhaps there would be a scene where it rains and he has to use the umbrella, rain washing droplets of blood onto the street and swirling into the drain.    ...

{"title": "The Anomaly by Michael Rutger", "date": "Thursday 1 November 2018", "text": "The AnomalyBy Michael RutgerPublished by Bonnier Zaffre (12 July 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionTHEY SOUGHT THE TRUTH. THEY FOUND A NIGHTMAREA team of explorers seek ancient treasures, hidden in a secret cave.At first it seems they will return empty handed. Then their luck turns.But the team's elation is short-lived as they become trapped there in the dark, with little possibility of escape.Then events take an even more terrifying turn.For not all secrets are meant to be found . . .My verdictThe Anomaly is a modern day Indiana Jones with its nail-biting rollercoaster storyline and action scenes that gave me palpitations.This archaeological thriller contains a combination of science, history, mythology and religion. It provides a mix of horror, action, sci fi and the bizarre, reminding me of the Fortean Times, Fringe and The X-Files, with their stories of the unexplained. The plot didn't feel particularly credible but it certainly felt very real, with its atmospheric, creepy and claustrophobic setting and a host of believable characters. The cavern was so well described (using all five senses) that I could picture it in my head while I was reading and felt as if I was there too.The horror in The Anomaly builds up gradually after a slightly slow start. Looking back, I realise this added to the tension and suspense - I knew disaster was going to strike (it always does in these books), but I had no idea when. And when it did, it hit hard, like reading the script of an action movie with an explosive climax. Eventually, the writing became so fast paced and energetic that I found myself having to slow down my reading pace, ignoring that my inner self was desperate to know what was going to happen next.The Anomaly is a high-octane journey into the unknown. It's a great action thriller and provided me with perfect escapism for a few hours. But maybe don't read it if you're afraid of the dark or enclosed spaces!"},

AUTHORSBarbara Vine. Ruth Rendell took her writing in a new direction away from detective fiction in her series of novels writing as Barbara Vine. Really good books remain timeless, and even though some of her psychological thrillers – exploring the why of a crime rather than the who -  were written more than thirty years ago, they feel modern and up to date. A Fatal Inversion, about a group of young people staying at a country house over one long hot summer, is particularly fine. ... FILMS/MOVIESBlack Widow. This 1987 film starring Debra Winger and Theresa Russell was way ahead of its time. It is so rare to find a film where the two leads are women, and this cat and mouse game, where detective Winger is trying to convince her superiors that Russell is repeatedly killing her husbands for their money, is the original Killing Eve.... TV DRAMASPrime Suspect – I worry there’s a theme here – everything I’ve picked so far is decades old! But it is impossible to underestimate how groundbreaking DCI Jane Tennyson was as a character on TV in the  first series in 1991. Impeccably and elegantly plotted, it dealt with sexism  and corruption in the police.  To show that I also like contemporary crime, I’m very impressed with Ozark. Less violent than Breaking Bad, it shows the ripple effect of the illegal drugs trade and makes the viewer realise that the money laundering end of the business has been under-represented in the endless crime dramas that revolve around drugs.... FICTIONAL KILLERSAmy Dunne in Gone Girl. She is a real game changer. The best killers are the ones that get away with it. And we know she is never going to get caught.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’m a fan of Harlan Coben’s Myron Bolitar, mainly because he’s a former sports pro and in an alternate universe I would have loved to have been fantastically good at tennis. His ruminations on life after peak physical fitness and fame are touching. It’s hard to beat Jack Reacher for pure, unadulterated reading entertainment.... MURDER WEAPONSStephen King’s use of a sit-on lawnmower to kill a policeman in Misery is genius.    ... DEATH SCENESDying in an Afghan hut after being injected with smallpox as Terry Hayes created in I Am Pilgrim takes some beating.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESGoogle Maps’ feature where you can walk down roads and actually see them is pure genius for the writer.

{"title": "Researching fiction versus non-fiction by Gill Paul", "date": "Monday 29 October 2018", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Gill Paul to Off-the-Shelf Books today. The Lost Daughter was published by Headline Review on 18 October 2018.Researching fiction versus non-fictionBy Gill PaulResearch is one of my favourite bits of my job. It means I get to sit and read books all day. What’s not to like? I’ve developed a habit of using torn bits of Post-It notes to mark facts I might want to use, so my books end up looking like scruffy yellow hedgehogs.I write historical novels and historical non-fiction, and the research process is quite different for each. With non-fiction I need to understand the big events: the nature of the political regime in power, the root causes of wars and famines, the movers and shakers of the day. With fiction, on the other hand, I need to know the tiny details: what kind of aspirin they took for a headache, where they did their grocery shopping and what style of clothes they wore.I usually narrate my novels from one or two characters’ points of view, so this means I can only include information that those characters would reasonably have known. In The Lost Daughter, the characters know nothing about the power struggles in Russian politics between Kerensky and Lenin, Lenin and Trotsky, then Stalin and just about everyone else. What I needed to find out in my research was what it was like to live under those regimes: the fact that country people who came to town during the 1921–22 famine were known disparagingly as lapti after the birch bark shoes they wore; that women queued for food coupons at separate offices – one for meat, one for vegetables, one for bread; and that soap ran out completely in the early 1920s. When writing about the siege of Leningrad, I couldn’t give the total numbers who died, because my characters wouldn’t have known that, but I could describe the eerie metronome sound that was broadcast from loudspeakers on street corners, punctuating their days.It will probably make me sound nerdy, but I get very excited when I come across a new detail that I know will fit my narrative. I don’t want to load it down, but just the odd snippet here and there helps to create a sense of authenticity. The quirkier, the better!I have the kind of readers who let me know when I get things wrong. In The Affair, I had my heroine, Diana, wearing tights in 1962 and I was devastated when someone who was clearly an expert emailed to tell me that although they were commonly worn in America then, they did not reach British shores till 1963, so Diana would have been in stockings and a suspender belt. Gah! I’ve also had dozens of emails telling me I got the name of the lake wrong in The Secret Wife – I called it Lake Akanabee and it’s Lake Abanakee – a simple error of transcription that was never picked up. These things are intensely irritating! I do a lot of fact-checking myself, and I’ll find experts to check specific areas on which I am clueless – like Russian Orthodox religion and military ranks – but some tiny things can always slip through the net.Of course, it’s fiction, so I could make it up if I wanted to. I tend to tinker with the bigger picture – like letting a Romanov daughter escape from Ekaterinburg – while trying to get the details spot on. In non-fiction, absolutely everything has to be true and that means the writing process is slower, because I can’t slip off into a chunk of made-up dialogue. I might manage to write 1,500 words a day in a novel, but it would probably be under 1,000 in non-fiction.There are similarities, though. Both fiction and non-fiction need a narrative drive, something that makes you want to keep turning the pages. Both need a writing style that suits the subject matter. And I would argue that both need to be emotionally engaging. Which do I prefer writing? Both are rewarding but if you forced me to answer, with my arm twisted up my back, I’d say fiction every time.            About Gill Paul Gill Paul is a Scottish-born, London-based writer of historical fiction and non-fiction.

AUTHORSAt the moment, it’s Cara Hunter. She has two books out in a series, and a third on its way that I have read too, as an early copy. She writes police procedurals. I find her style so energetic, raw and her storylines and plots so fast and furious that I can’t turn the pages quick enough. Her main character, DI Adam Fawley, reminds me so much of David Tennant in Broadchurch that I almost imagine it is him as I read.... FILMS/MOVIESSeven is one of my all-time favourites as I find it so cleverly plotted, dark and disgusting and yet compelling at the same time. Morgan Freeman is one of my favourite actors too. The first time I watched it, I had no idea what was going on, and then when it all became clear, I thought it was so clever. So much so that I used the same method for one of my novels – can’t tell you which one though!... TV DRAMASLine of Duty. Although there is a huge amount of poetic license in the procedural element of the plot that has me shouting at the TV a fair amount of times, this is a show that is built on fantastic recurring characters, and a sense of being right there in the room in the investigation with them. I remember one scene being in the interview room for the whole hour and it was so tense. I was sitting on the edge of my seat. Vicky McClure is one of my favourite actresses too.... FICTIONAL KILLERSBonnie and Clyde. A love story within with the violence. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I thoroughly enjoy the lead detectives in the series Unforgotten. Nicola Walker is a terrific actress and with her DI, I just love their ‘ordinariness.’ I pride myself in keeping my characters as ordinary as possible. They may have colourful backgrounds but they are nice to their colleagues and families. I like that sense of normality. As well, the emotion they bring to each show and then the ability to flip that to a one line of humour is great writing.  ... MURDER WEAPONSThat would have to be death by chocolate…    ... DEATH SCENESIt has to be the shoot out at the end of Enemy of the State, where Will Smith is playing one crime family against another. The way he plays them both is just genius, and I love how he comes out of it after climbing under the table to hide.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESResearch for my novels is so varied that there is never the one, and always a few new ones with each subject I tackle. I tend to buy a lot of non-fiction books on each subject I write about too. ... WRITING TIPSI use a Twitter hashtag #keeponkeepingon so I guess that would be my writing tip. It’s so easy to get carried away in the first few happy chapters as we get to know our characters. Then comes the middle muddle and often that’s where writers stop because they have lost the momentum, and the faith to see it through to the end. My advice would be to carry on – write a ‘dirty’ first draft that no one will see. Once the words are down, they can always be edited. No one can edit a blank page. ...

A community formed around the edges of a mysterious alien biodome, its residents comprise the hopeful, the hungry and the helpless—people eager for a glimpse inside the dome or a taste of its rumoured healing powers.Kaaro is a government agent with a criminal past. He has seen inside the biodome, and doesn't care to again—but when something begins killing off others like himself, Kaaro must defy his masters to search for an answer, facing his dark history and coming to a realization about a horrifying future.Technology by Tade Thompson)For the most part science fiction is pretty bad at predicting the future, although one should make a distinction between saying “this is future tech” and being an inspiration in the mind of a scientist. For example, the late, great Jack Kirby’s Mother Box technology is very similar to what we call a smart phone. There’s nothing wrong with grown scientists wanting to create things they saw on Star Trek when they were kids.Knowing all this, I still went ahead and tried to extrapolate a future: that all humans would be given a chip ID in the future, similarly to what we do for pets right now. Growing up in an area of Nigeria where Christian Fundamentalism is rife, discussions of various incarnations of the dreaded Mark of the Beast were one of our favourite pastimes. The Mark being related to computer identification is one of the more accepted interpretations, and I just included it in ROSEWATER as something Nigerians would recognise is coming.And it probably is coming, what with identity theft, password fatigue, election hacking and other problems of identity management.In the world of ROSEWATER you are chipped as a baby and the government follows you everywhere, from waking hours through sleep, sex, to entrance examinations.

AUTHORSGillian Flynn! The worlds and characters she creates are so dark and messy and intriguing - I love them. She’s the queen of the unlikeable character, and she uses such vivid imagery, all of her books are just perfect. I re-read them all at least once a year, because even though I know what happens, they’re written so well that I’m taken on the journey again and again.... FILMS/MOVIESI absolutely love The Fugitive and have probably seen it about 20 times. I have a slight obsession with wrongful conviction stories (which is why Double Jeopardy is another firm favourite), and The Fugitive has me on the edge of my seat every time I see it. Plus Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are so much fun to watch!... TV DRAMASI’m very much into true crime dramas right now, so Making a Murderer, The Staircase, Killer Women (the show hosted by Piers Morgan) and Evil Genius are all recent favourites. When it comes to fictional dramas, I’m really enjoying Ozark at the moment, and am excited to get stuck into season 2 soon. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSDexter - he’s the only killer I’ve ever felt sympathy for, and his development over the course of the show was remarkable. He was such a cleverly written character, because as a viewer, I just wanted him to succeed. I’m not sure what that says about me, though!... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I know Castle is not technically a detective, but he fancies himself one and the results are usually (predictably) hilarious. And Detective Beckett, who’s an actual detective, and who Castle is sidekick to, is an absolute badass and knows how to put him in his place when he’s getting too cheeky. They make a fab pair. ... MURDER WEAPONSThe gold paint that smothered the Bond Girl in Goldfinger was a stroke of genius, and after watching the film as a kid it haunted me for years. Apparently it wouldn’t actually happen in real life but it was still an incredible scene and a creative murder weapon anyway!    ... DEATH SCENESThe method of his death was not unusual as such, but the murder of Ned Stark in Game of Thrones was so utterly shocking that it is an unforgettable scene. It was the first time I stopped trusting that the hero of a series was going to journey through to the end of the storyline, and it was a devastating moment.   ...

{"title": "Trap by Lilja Sigurdardóttir", "date": "Wednesday 17 October 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Trap by Lilja Sigurdardóttir. Trap is published by Orenda Books in paperback on 18th October 2018.TrapBy Lilja SigurdardóttirPublished by Orenda Books (e-book - 13 September; paperback - 18 October 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionHappily settled in Florida, Sonja believes she’s finally escaped the trap set by unscrupulous drug lords. But when her son Tomas is taken, she’s back to square one … and Iceland.Her lover, Agla, is awaiting sentencing for financial misconduct after the banking crash, and Sonja refuses to see her. And that’s not all … Agla owes money to some extremely powerful men, and they’ll stop at nothing to get it back.Set in a Reykjavík still covered in the dust of the Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption, and with a dark, fast-paced and chilling plot and intriguing characters, Trap is an outstandingly original and sexy Nordic crime thriller, from one of the most exciting new names in crime fiction.My verdictYet again, Lilja Sigurdardóttir has written an addictive thriller with well-defined characters and a rollercoaster storyline. I thought Sonja's life was complicated in previous book Snare. Well, in Trap, it now becomes even more complicated, as she finds herself cornered by powerful drug barons and her scheming ex-husband.Trap certainly trapped me within its 225 pages while I blocked out the rest of the world for a while. Short snappy chapters, switching between characters, kept the story flowing at a fast pace, making it very easy to read 'one more chapter' and then 'just one more'. I had to force myself not to race through the latter half of the book (as I was desperate to see what was in store for Sonja). Instead, I deliberately slowed down my reading pace to savour all of the poetic descriptions.In Trap, reluctant cocaine smuggler Sonja, who was on the run with her son Tomas, is dragged back to Iceland to 'pay her debts' and her lover, disgraced banker Agla, is awaiting trial for financial misconduct. Reykjavik is still covered in volcanic dust and the Icelanders are still struggling with the financial crash. Sonja is now working with customs officer Bragi, who has his beloved wife Valdís home and will do anything to make sure he can afford the nursing care she needs as her dementia progresses. Great to see Mr José and his tiger back too (providing me with a few laughs as well as a few OMG moments - breaking up the darkness at the heart of the book).Trap covers serious issues, including money laundering and drug dealing. Yet it is also laced with tenderness and affection, with key characters Sonja and Bragi prepared to risk their lives and reputations for their loved ones. Sonja is a great character - a loving mother who will do anything to keep her son safe, strong and capable when she needs to be but also naive enough to get herself into all manner of difficult (and often dangerous) situations. I still haven't warmed fully to Agla - she's a manipulator and a schemer, which is how she ended up on the wrong side of the law, but she's now slowly redeeming herself.I found this to be an easy read, thanks to the seamless translation by Quentin Bates. The tension escalated throughout the book, culminating in a thrilling, heart-stopping conclusion. And while most of the threads were tied up neatly by the end, leaving me feeling satisfied, I can't wait to see what happens next.Follow the Blog Tour"},

I mean, the scene in Scream 3 where Sidney has to climb over the unconscious killer to get out of the cop car… talk about holding one’s breath! Amazing. ... TV DRAMASSilent Witness. It’s just so British and I love it, and although it doesn’t always ring true when it comes to procedure, I love it for what it is. How they continually come up with new ideas after two decades is astonishing!... FICTIONAL KILLERSI think it has to be the Scream trilogy again. There’s a different masked killer in each film, and yet the ‘Ghost Killer’ became a staple character of its own. Genius. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Clarice Starling. I love a rookie who wins, and boy did she have to go through some sh*t to win!... MURDER WEAPONSI think the dagger-like icicle is the most ingenious. A weapon that melts away after it’s been used? Sign me up! Although the ice pick in Basic Instinct is also a contender!    ... DEATH SCENESThe death scene that I’ll never forget (because it genuinely traumatised me and rendered me speechless) was in The Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum. The fact that it’s based on a true story makes the string of events even more horrifying. This book is not for everyone (probably not for anyone!).  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI actually don’t have any staple websites or blogs I visit for research. With each story comes a new subject matter, so I’m surfing all over the place and never visit the same website twice. However, I’ve found Youtube extremely useful for finding information on a huge range of topics. ... WRITING TIPSIt is very normal to hate your own writing.The first draft is for you; the other drafts are for the readers. Repeat after me: ‘I cannot please everyone’. There will always be someone who is going to hate your work (and be vocal about it) – this is not a reflection on your talent or worth. In a very competitive, sometimes cut-throat industry, I think this is a very handy motto to live by: don’t be jealous, be inspired. ... WRITING SNACKSI start off relatively healthy, mirroring my optimism before the real work begins and the snacks gets worse and worse until I’m essentially shoveling sugar into my mouth during copy-edits. Best snacks/fuel: chocolate and coffee.About JACK JORDANJack Jordan is the bestselling author of four books: Anything for Her, My Girl, A Woman Scorned, and Before Her Eyes, with number five, Night by Night, arriving in 2019. Find Jack Jordan on Instagram, on his Facebook page and on Twitter - @JackJordanBooksAbout BEFORE HER EYESPublisher's descriptionShe can't see the killerBut the killer can see her...Naomi Hannah has been blind since birth.

{"title": "Cold Breath by Quentin Bates", "date": "Friday 12 October 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Cold Breath by Quentin Bates. Cold Breath was published by Constable on 11 October 2018.Cold Breath By Quentin BatesPublished by Constable (11 October 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionGunnhildur reluctantly allows herself to be taken off police duties to act as bodyguard to a man with a price on his head . . . Hidden away in a secure house outside Reykjavík, Gunna and the high-profile stranger, a guest of the interiors minister, are thrown together - too close for comfort. They soon find they are neither as safe nor as carefully hidden as Gunna and her boss had thought. Conflicting glimpses of the man's past start to emerge as the press begin to sniff him out, as does another group with their own reasons for locating him. Gunna struggles to come to terms with protecting the life of a man who may have the lives of many on his conscience - or indeed may be the philanthropist he claims to be.Isolated together, the friction grows between Gunna and the foreign visitor, and she realises they are out of their depth as the trails lead from the house outside Reykjavík to Brussels, Russia and the Middle East.My verdictCold Breath is a twisty mix of Icelandic police procedural and action thriller.Gunna is acting as bodyguard to a guest of the interiors minister, but doesn't know why she's been asked to do this job. Her foreign charge is as cagey as everyone else who knows where he's in hiding, yet they're having to live in very close proximity - too close at times. Gradually Gunna begins to piece together his history, and his past, and doesn't like everything she finds, leading her to wonder who she's really protecting - and why. She's not the only one with questions, as there's a relentless journalist on their trail, and also some ruthless killers on the loose, determined to discover where this high-profile visitor is being hidden.Cold Breath features several strands, all equally intriguing, following the various different characters, from police officers and journalists to the determined villains. Gradually, these individual strands weave together to reveal a complex well-planned plot. It soon became clear to me that nothing was clearcut, with the killers and the press closing in, culminating in an action-packed explosive ending.Gunna is a tough cookie, yet also has plenty of heart, focusing as much on her family as on her job - and she definitely brings the story to life. I have read the previous book in this series, but haven't yet read any of the others, yet there's enough backstory here to be able to read Cold Breath as a standalone. The chilling Icelandic setting is a perfect backdrop, and the author's vivid evocative descriptions transported me there myself - feeling the freezing temperatures, experiencing suburban life just outside Reykjavik and seeing the starkness of more-remote areas. Quentin Bates lived in Iceland for a decade and still visits the country every year, and this personal knowledge of Icelandic culture shows in his writing.Cold Breath is a gripping read and a great addition to any Nordic Noir crime shelf.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Two sides to every story by Antti Tuomainen", "date": "Wednesday 10 October 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Palm Beach Finland by Antti Tuomainen (translated by David Hackston). Antti tells us why there are two sides to every story - creating criminal characters. Palm Beach Finland is published by Orenda Books, and will be published in paperback on 18 October 2018.Two sides to every storyBy Antti TuomainenI have been writing crime fiction now for 15 years. I published my first novel in 2006 after several unpublishable manuscripts which I consider my basic training. (Actually, the advanced training still continues after eight published novels, but that is another story.) One thing I've always found quite a lot of fun is writing the bad guys. You know, the criminals. Or, to be completely accurate, the ones committing the crime in crime fiction.   In writing criminal characters, I suppose there are several reasons for my sense of enjoyment. One reason is certainly the type of criminals I've had in my book. They have been, with a few exceptions, amateurs at their chosen task. They have been regular human beings who out of necessity do what they have to do to get out of their given situation and/or they're on some deeply personal level mixed in criminal doings. Either way, what has been important to me, is that I portray them as human beings. (This also gives me a chance to examine what each of us would do in an extreme situation.)By portraying them as human beings, I mean that I aim to make them multi-dimensional persons. They are not completely evil and complete evilness is not the reason they commit their crimes. Sometimes they are not evil at all. They are just people caught in a highly surprising situation. Although, having said that, I have previously, for example, written about a hitman named Emil (The Mine, Orenda Books, 2016) whose work-related actions can't be defended, yet even he was something else besides a hitman. He was a father and his main concern in the story was in getting to know his son after not seeing him for 30 years. I didn't make him multi-dimensional to provide an excuse for his unusual line of work, but rather to deepen his character and to show him as a human being: faulty like the rest of us (and perhaps a tad more deadly) and trying his best with what limited means he had. My latest book in English, Palm Beach Finland, out this November, brings forth another type of criminal entrepreneurs. Those with serious limitations in their wisdom-department, as the saying goes. Chico and Robin are not bad guys. They just end up doing all kinds bad things and causing general mayhem while trying their best to advance their ambitious personal plans. Their aim is true and pure, they wish to make their dreams come true, but chaos ensues. I loved writing them. And who can't identify with trying your best and ending up with the worst possible result. We've all experienced a version of that. It's just that it keeps happening to them all the time. Yet they're – I hope – likable mates all the way through. As the story progresses we learn more about them and find out certain things that are in no way unique. They wish to be loved, accepted, seen. This universal human wish sees them diving headfirst into trouble. In Palm Beach Finland, we also have a cold-blooded criminal, a killer named Holma. But even he, in all his twistedness, has the same wish that his less-savvy criminal competitors Chico and Robin have. Holma wishes that people respected him, admired him, even worshipped him. But in him, it is safe to say, these qualities have over-powered the man. But that is human, too. That can happen. I noticed that writing Holma was different from writing Chico and Robin. I needed a bit more distance, a bit more coolness. And yet, by recognizing those characteristics that had him totally blinded, I found him and his character quite naturally and enjoyed writing his parts of the book. All of the previous is a way of saying that there really are two sides to every story. Every crime fiction story, anyway. And for me, that is arguably a sizable part of the enjoyment of writing crime fiction: looking at something from both directions, so to speak. When you're writing about well-rounded characters doing all sorts of things, you're of course, at least in a roundabout way, turning the light on yourself, trying to see if I could be doing that or if I could be that person. So far, I've stuck to writing. But you know, since there are two sides to every…            About Antti TuomainenFinnish Antti Tuomainen was an award-winning copywriter when he made his literary debut in 2007 as a suspense author.

{"title": "The Murder of Harriet Monckton by Elizabeth Haynes", "date": "Tuesday 9 October 2018", "text": "The Murder of Harriet MoncktonBy Elizabeth HaynesPublished by Myriad Editions (27 September 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionOn 7th November 1843, Harriet Monckton, 23 years old and a woman of respectable parentage and religious habits, is found murdered in the privy behind the chapel she regularly attended in Bromley, Kent.The community is appalled by her death, apparently as a result of swallowing a fatal dose of prussic acid, and even more so when the surgeon reports that Harriet was around six months pregnant.Drawing on the coroner’s reports and witness testimonies, Elizabeth Haynes builds a compelling picture of Harriet’s final hours through the eyes of those closest to her and the last people to see her alive. Her fellow teacher and companion, her would-be fiancé, her seducer, her former lover—all are suspects; each has a reason to want her dead.My verdictThe Murder of Harriet Monckton is exquisite - a haunting and compelling historical whodunnit. It's based on a Victorian crime, using original research materials to explore what happened to a young woman, Harriet Monckton, who was murdered with her unborn son.Reading this book felt like reading the script of an Agatha Christie movie. The chapters switch from one character to the next and then back again, building up their layers, turning them into well-rounded and very real individuals. Elizabeth Haynes brings each character to life - Harriet's friends, family and other locals - exploring their possible motives, all being potential suspects with something to hide.I loved the format of the book, with each character telling their own part of the story as if they were on centre stage, creating a vivid picture of Harriet's last living moments. When I heard Harriet's own voice, I could feel the swell of emotions as finally Harriet had her say.The Murder of Harriet Monckton is more than just a true crime murder mystery. It's a 'me too' story of the 1840s, a disturbing insight into the social expectations, naivety of young women and the importance of religion within communities. The story felt authentic from start to finish, thanks to meticulous research providing specific details in the descriptions of the characters, setting and social interactions of that era.I didn't want this book to end - and was sorry to finally let go. It feels like a suitable memorial to a young woman and her unborn child - gone but, thanks to Elizabeth Haynes, certainly not forgotten."},

The mountaintops force the wind in various directions, pulling at the plane from all angles, and we’re so small here, all in a row; the backs of the heads in front of me shudder in unison. More than half the population on the ground below us believes it’s OK to raise a hand to their children, I think to myself, and for a moment my eyes seek out my own children; but they’re hidden from view, seated four rows in front of me. Beside them, Olaf rests his head against the cabin wall. In front of him I spy Ellen’s blonde hair, and between the seats I can see that Mum is sleeping, her head resting on Ellen’s shoulder. Dad wanders along the aisle between the rows of seats, wearing his new Bose headphones around his neck. Did he wear them to the toilet? I feel a warm flicker of affection and smile at him, but I fail to catch his eye. He sits down beside Håkon, and I catch only glimpses of Dad’s face, his high cheekbones and the tip of his nose, which has a faint blue hue about it from the glow of the laptop in front of him.            They could be anyone. We could be anyone.*It’s raining in Rome. Everyone is prepared for it; we’ve been checking the forecast every day for the past three weeks, and we’ve discussed it on the phone and via text message and in our family Facebook group, reassuring ourselves that it doesn’t matter, that it’s April, and April brings unpredictable weather, plus it’s bound to be warmer than it is Norway, and it’s not the weather we’re going for, anyway. Even so, the mood at Gardermoen Airport, which was bathed in spring sunshine and close to a balmy 20oC, was noticeably better than it is at Fiumicino Airport, where it is 13oC and raining. The mood may also have something to do with a sense of anticlimax, an acknowledgement that the tension and goodwill with which we greeted one another at Gardermoen has dwindled over the course of the flight; the first leg now over and done with, everybody’s shoulders have relaxed ever so slightly.            Having the others here, even at the airport, makes me feel intruded upon. I try to catch Olaf’s eye, to seek some confirmation that he feels the same; Rome and all that surrounds it, everything that belongs to it, is ours. Walking through the arrivals hall feels different this time: I don’t exhale in the same way I do when Olaf and I are here by ourselves, I don’t feel that same frisson of excitement. But Olaf is busy buying train tickets for everyone, and I lament my own ingratitude, my self-absorption. I make up for it by picking up Hedda, kissing her nose and asking if the plane’s shaking scared her. She squirms free, no doubt hyper after munching her way through the biscuits and chocolate that Olaf wasn’t supposed to deploy in anything other than an absolute emergency.            We’re due to spend two days in Rome before leaving for Olaf’s brother’s house, which is located in a small village by the coast. Two days is both far too brief and far too long a stay, I think to myself for the first time, and I see both my own little family – the one I’ve created with Olaf – and the one that I’ve come from, with new eyes.*Dad turns seventy in four days’ time. Last year, during his birthday meal, he called for silence and announced that the following year’s birthday gift to himself and the whole family would be a holiday – his treat. We could go anywhere, he declared, turning to Hedda, who was four years old at the time: ‘We could even go all the way to Africa!’            The idea itself, the manner of its announcement and his almost frenzied disposition in the months leading up to his sixty-ninth birthday were so out of character that for a while afterwards, and on a daily basis, Ellen sent me lists of brain-tumour symptoms. It’s probably just a reaction to the fact that he’s nearing seventy, Olaf said. But Ellen and I were having none of it: He’s not the kind to make a fuss about his age. He’s always poked fun at people who create a crisis when their birthday comes around – the kind who compensate with over-the-top reactions. They’re using their age as an excuse, he’s always said. They’re really making a fuss about something else. But Dad didn’t seem ill, and he didn’t seem to be in the midst of any kind of crisis. And our concerns about him weren’t so overwhelming that they outweighed our pleasure at being treated to a holiday, so Ellen and I let it go.            We haven’t been on holiday together for what must now be twenty years, not since the days when the concept of ‘family’ extended no further than Ellen, Håkon, Mum, Dad and myself. Occasionally we’ve ensured that our stays in the family cabin have overlapped, with Mum and Dad and Håkon, and maybe even Ellen, staying on for an extra few days before Olaf, the children and I are given the run of the place, but this kind of trip – an organised pack-your-bags-and-off-we-go kind of trip – we haven’t embarked on since I was in my early twenties, and Ellen and Håkon and I found ourselves piled in the back of a rental car in Provence.            I don’t recall us being quite so distant back then, not like we are now. Moving away from Oslo and out of the house in Tåsen, leaving behind the familiar framework, with its fixed patterns, conversations, gatherings, places at the table, it’s done something to the family dynamic; nobody knows quite how to act, how to adapt, which role they should take. Maybe it also has something to do with the fact that we’re three adults on holiday with our parents; we’re half grown, yet still their children.            The Africa idea was quickly vetoed – by everyone but Hedda, that is – and it was actually Olaf who suggested Italy, saying that we could stay in his brother’s house there. Olaf is careful never to find himself in anybody’s debt, and the thought of Dad paying for a holiday for him and his children very quickly became too much to bear. You can’t offer him money, I said when Olaf suggested we pay our own way; it’d be condescending. Liv and I really want to show you the Italy that we’ve come to know, Olaf told Mum and Dad. Perhaps we could combine that with your seventieth birthday celebrations?*We’re far too big for Italy. Big and white and blond, we barely fit around the table at the restaurant that evening. The furniture and interiors have been designed with trim little Italians in mind, not for Dad and Håkon, both almost six feet four inches tall; not for such long arms and legs; not for us. We cram ourselves into our chairs, all elbows and knees, too many joints jostling for room. Ellen and Håkon squabble over the available space, suddenly teenagers all over again. I recall the way we identified the seams between the seat cushions in the back of the car, treating them as border lines – even the slightest hint of coat flap crossing a seam was forbidden. The air around us was subject to the same restrictions. Håkon was only three at the time, but he grew up with sisters and with clearly defined lines in the car, in the tent and at the dining table – and in life in general, really – lines that laid down the ground rules.            Sitting beside us is an Italian family. There are more of them than there are of us, but, as Håkon points out, they’re seated around a smaller table, all making their way through one dish after the next, just like Olaf and I did on our first trip to Rome. We’d told the waiter that we wanted to order the same as the family at the table next to us. I spent the following week gazing at large Italian families sitting down to eat together for several hours every evening – children and grandparents, loud and prone to gesticulation, just like in the films, and I missed my own family, though I knew even then that it wouldn’t be the same if they were there. Here. But now they are here; now we’re here, all of us seated around the same table: Mum, Dad, Ellen; Ellen’s boyfriend, Simen; Agnar and Hedda; Olaf and me – and Håkon.            I glance over at Dad sitting at the head of the table, and it strikes me that we’re sitting exactly where we sit when we’re at our parents’ house. Dad always sits at the head of the table, with Mum to his right and me beside her, and Håkon across from Mum with Ellen by his side. Other, later additions to the family – partners, Olaf, Agnar, Hedda – have had to organise themselves around us; I don’t think we’ve ever given it a single thought. The only person ever to initiate any kind of silent protest is Simen; on the few occasions he’s joined us for family gatherings, he’s practically launched himself at the seat beside Ellen – Håkon’s place at the table – draping an arm across the back of her chair and firmly clinging to his spot until everyone else has taken a seat.            Dad has thick grey hair, and even though pictures from when I was little show him with the dark hair he once had, I can only just recall it – in my memories, he always has the same grey hair he has now. He locks eyes with me and smiles, and I wonder what he’s thinking about, if he’s happy, if things are how he imagined they would be. Perhaps he hasn’t imagined them at all. He tends not to predict whether things will be one way or the other, but he’s always commented on my own tendency to do so: You have to try to accept things as they are, Liv, he would tell me when I was young and shedding anguished tears over holidays, handball matches or school assignments that hadn’t gone as I’d predicted, finding it impossible to explain to Dad just how critical it was that they should unfold exactly as I’d anticipated; any action or accomplishment, great or small, had to follow a predictable course to prevent things from becoming chaotic and intangible. But you can’t plan life in that kind of detail, Dad said, you need to accept that you can’t always control things.            Now he’s leaning over to Mum. The hearing in his right ear – the ear that’s always on Mum’s side at the dinner table – isn’t what it once was, and she lifts a hand to create a buffer between her words and the clamour of the restaurant. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. Dad doesn’t look at her; he smiles and nods slightly.            ‘So, have you made up your minds?’ he asks aloud, looking out across the table before Mum has lowered her hand. He brandishes the menu, waving it slightly.            Scarcely two minutes have gone by since the menus were handed out to us, and he hasn’t yet opened his own.            ‘We should probably start by ordering some wine,’ Mum says.            Dad doesn’t respond to this. He studies his menu carefully. She leans over to his hard-of-hearing side and repeats herself, and he nods yet again without saying a word, just looking down. Mum smiles, but not at him, not at any of us. She opens the wine list.*We don’t have to spend every waking moment together, Mum said as we planned our two-day stay in Rome, and Håkon pointed out that nobody else felt the need to visit the Maxxi Museum. The need, Mum repeated. It’s hardly a need. You’re making it out to be as fundamental as eating. It’s not a need, but a desire, and I think it’s worth making time for. And even though Håkon and Ellen were both there too, as usual I felt that her words were aimed at me, that there was an underlying message that was somehow critical, in this case a dig at the fact that Olaf and I had holidayed in Rome on several occasions without ever having visited a single art gallery. In truth, it was an attack on our entire approach to going on holiday, to raising our children, to living our lives – of the kind that hits me just the same each and every time; the kind I’m so used to that I’m incapable of forming concrete thoughts about it; there is only a stab of emotion that is preserved in my memory, telling me there’s something I need to protect myself against. Rome itself is a museum, I replied hastily. There’s so much else to see, it seems a bit unnecessary to me. She smiled condescendingly, as she always does whenever she sees through my argument or when I do something she describes as precocious, even to this day. Don’t be so precocious, she says, and I forget every single time that I’m a grown woman in my forties.            Of course, we don’t have to spend every waking moment together, she repeated, then looked at us to assess the impact of her words, and now, as we stand trapped in a throng of Japanese tourists milling around outside the Colosseum, I feel certain that Ellen and Håkon share my feeling that we ought to have gone to the art gallery with Mum.            Dad has gone to the Vatican by himself. He didn’t ask if anyone wanted to join him, instead simply announcing over breakfast that it was what he planned to do today. There’s something not quite right about it all, I said to Olaf after breakfast. Something isn’t quite right between them. You can see it too, I insisted, but I wasn’t sure what exactly it was that I was seeing. On the one hand they were being nicer to one another than they had been in a long time – teasing one another, laughing emphatically at one another’s anecdotes and engaging in topics of conversation brought up by the other as if their take on things was fresh and new, or as if they were seeing their arguments in a new light, perhaps. On the other hand, there was a noticeable distance between them, a lack of intimacy.            Olaf told me not to spend so much time focusing on them. We’re on holiday too, you know, he said. And anyway, scrutinising their every move isn’t likely to change anything. That’s hardly what I’m doing, I replied, and Olaf laughed.*Agnar insists on queuing to enter the Colosseum. We can’t see where the queue begins or ends; it’ll take several hours. Ellen and Håkon laugh and shake their heads, say that they’d rather sit in the café we walked past just across the way. I look at Olaf, who shrugs wearily.            ‘I can go on my own,’ Agnar says.            ‘Are you mad? I don’t think so,’ I reply, almost without thinking.            Agnar looks at Olaf.            ‘It’s not that bad an idea, surely,’ Olaf says.            ‘It’s a terrible idea, Olaf,’ I tell him.            Agnar has only just turned fourteen, and I think he’s a little immature for his age. Olaf thinks that he’s probably about right for his age, but Agnar still looks upon most situations with the childish expectation that everything will work out just as it should, giving no thought to the consequences, driven only by impulse. He always regrets things afterwards, and is wracked with anguish when he realises how worried Olaf and I have been when he’s come home an hour later than planned without ever picking up his phone, for example – but then the entire situation plays out in exactly the same way just a few days later. We’ve told him it’s self-centred, that he needs to buck up his ideas, that we need to be able to trust him. But at the same time I know it’s nothing to do with trust – he doesn’t do it on purpose, as he himself points out. When I’m in the middle of something, I just forget, he tells us. He forgets absolutely everything else too. I know that and I understand it, but Olaf and I are at a loss as to how we should handle the situation. Olaf sees a little too much of himself in Agnar, and is convinced that the best course of action is for us to give him more freedom, not less. Back at the kitchen table in Oslo, four days before leaving, sitting across from ‘Angst-ridden Agnar’, as Olaf has taken to calling him on the days following our confrontations, those days when Agnar can’t do enough for us – making coffee and breakfast and offering to look after Hedda and do any number of other lovely favours – I was open to testing this approach.            But not here, not in Rome. Come on, Olaf, I convey, with a look in his direction.            ‘I’ve got my phone,’ Agnar says.            ‘Which you only ever answer when it suits you,’ I say. ‘Better that I come with you instead.’ I can’t deny him the chance to go inside the Colosseum when he’s showing such enthusiasm. He’s developed an interest in history and architecture over the past few years that has taken us by surprise, and when I told him we’d be going to Rome, his eyes shone.            ‘No, you don’t have to do that, I wantto go by myself,’ Agnar says, fidgeting with impatience, nervously playing with his left ear, just like Håkon does in stressful situations.            ‘It’s not about what you want, it’s about what you’re capable of,’ I tell him. Hedda tugs at my hand – she wants to sit down on the filthy tarmac. I pull her up again and she starts to whinge, hanging from my arm like a monkey, my shoulder aching.            ‘He’s capable. Look, this is what we’ll do,’ Olaf says, and takes both of Agnar’s shoulders in his hands, looking him directly in the eye. ‘You’ve got two hours. That gives you until three o’clock. That means that if you haven’t made it in by then, you have to leave the queue. At three o’clock, we’ll meet at the café just up there,’ Olaf says, pointing at the café Håkon and Ellen are making their way towards.            Agnar nods, almost paralysed, not daring to look at me for fear that I’ll ruin things with my objections. But Olaf and I have made a virtually unbreakable pact not to disagree with one another in front of the children, to take a consistent and coordinated approach to their upbringing, to rules and boundaries, so I can do nothing but nod. I’m proud of him, too – the fact that he’s so persistent in his interest in things that other fourteen-year-olds wouldn’t give a second thought – and I wish that Mum were here to see it.            Olaf checks that Agnar’s phone is fully charged, gives him money to keep in his pocket, with instructions not to retrieve it until it’s time to pay, and tells him that he has to check the time every ten minutes, that this is a test, the kind he needs to pass if he really wants the freedom he’s been craving all this time. Has Agnar understood?            ‘Every ten minutes. Three o’clock. Money. Café. Message received!’ Agnar says, and smiles his lovely smile, the one that lights up his soft, innocent face – the kind of face that would be a dream for any child kidnapper or paedophile. I feel sick and anxious as I watch him disappear into the crowd.*Olaf takes Hedda to a playpark, and I make my way to the café, looking back over my shoulder every ten steps to see if I can spot Agnar in the queue. I can’t remember what I was like at fourteen but feel fairly certain that I’d never have suggested going off on my own in a foreign city.            Håkon and Ellen are sitting at the edge of a terrace with a view of the Colosseum. Simen has decided to have a lie-in and meet us for lunch instead. His approach to holidays is unthinkable in our family – the idea of not getting out and about, not doingsomething. Holidays are about sleeping late for me, Simen warned us at dinner the previous night. Dad’s smile was strained. I imagine that Simen is also the type who can park himself in front of the television on a Friday night when the weather is good, something which is physically impossible for myself and Håkon and Ellen. Even now, as an adult, I feel guilty about doing anything other than making the most of the good weather, something that Dad established as a rule and imprinted upon us every sunny Saturday and Sunday since the day we were born.            Håkon has ordered a bottle of red wine; I ask the waiter to bring me a glass. Ellen covers her glass with her hand when he comes to pour some for her.            ‘I’m halfway through another course of antibiotics,’ she says; she’s been plagued by recurring urinary-tract infections.            ‘You must be contributing more than your fair share to the global antibiotic resistance, the way you get through those things,’ Håkon says. ‘Maybe you should try drinking more cranberry juice.’            ‘It’s interesting to hear that you know so much about urinary-tract infections, Håkon. Is there any subject you’renotan expert on? Anything you don’t have an opinion on?’ Ellen retorts with a smile, rolling her eyes.            Their bickering makes me feel calmer, but I’m aware of my heart hammering inside my chest. My gaze is locked on the crowds of tourists, Agnar no doubt milling among them, unable to find his way. I take a large sip of wine, close my eyes and swallow. For a moment I envy Ellen and Håkon, sitting there entirely devoid of responsibility, free, desperately seeking nothing but the sun, which peeks through the thin layer of cloud that lingers above us.            It’s not often we’re together, just the three of us. It’s only since Håkon got older that we occasionally meet up for a beer or dinner, Ellen and I always taking the initiative. Ellen is two years younger than I am, and Håkon is eight years younger than Ellen – he turned thirty just a few weeks ago. It’s only in the past few years that he’s started getting in touch with us, that the distance between us has felt less stark than it did when he was ten and I was twenty, and we’ve come to know one another in a different way, as adults – even though the sense of hierarchy is still tangible. I feel like he and Ellen have a very different relationship; they spend more time together and are in touch with one another more often than with me. I have the sense that they feel they’ve got more in common – and in fact there’s something in that: they both look like Mum; they have her blonde hair and big eyes. Ellen shares Mum’s curvaceous figure too – she’s soft and plump in a graceful, attractive way, unlike me. My body has always been thin, almost angular.            I’d love to have swapped places with her; I’d love to have Ellen’s body. I still remember how awful it was when she had more shape about her at fourteen than I did at sixteen – bigger boobs, the works. I recall the way the boys in my class would ring the house to speak to her. I was furious with her, wrote in my diaries that I hated her and listed a hundred reasons why: that she nagged, that she was clingy, a brat. When she had a boyfriend before me – a boy who used to sit with us at the dinner table and play with her hair – I told Mum that I wanted to move out. I made every argument possible without mentioning Ellen, but I realised afterwards that Mum must have seen through it all. I wrote in my diary that Mum took me out and about to various places, that the two of us went to see Grandma and Grandad, had dinner out, went to the cinema, that she spent a lot of time with me without inviting Ellen. I only ever seemed to mention all this in passing, though, perhaps alongside a comment or short review of the film we went to see. I didn’t seem to be reflecting on or appreciating Mum’s obvious efforts at the time, or perhaps it was just too embarrassing, even in my own diary, to seek sympathy for the fact that I had a younger sister who was much more successful than I was in every single way.            I still feel tiny glimmers of that shameful, overwhelming envy. It flares up in me when I see the looks she attracts as we walk down the street or sit together in a café, when I see pictures of us in our younger years, or worst of all, when I see the way she talks to Olaf sometimes – no, in fact, it’s the other way around: the way he  talks to her. I’ve never asked him about it, even though the most banal questions assault my mind with a childish intensity: Do you think she’s prettier than I am? Would you choose her if you could? Even during our most serious arguments, when I almost lose control over what I’m doing or saying, still I keep these questions to myself. I’ve longed to scream them at him, particularly during those early days together, but I’ve always caught myself in time, instead singling out a colleague or friend of his: Don’t think I can’t see the way you look at her, I’ve shouted, the way you light up around her. Do you really think you’ve got a chance? Do you really think she’d be interested in you? It’s so petty and so shameful, but it beats the alternative.<!--/* Style Definitions */p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0cm;

When I met Olaf, I found that Ellen filled a new role. All of a sudden, she was someone I could confide in – she became a person, a sister, someone close to me, not simply a manifestation of everything I envied and could never be. I had been studying journalism and living in Majorstua with a friend while Ellen had continued to live at home. The year after I moved out, I don’t think we saw each other at all, beyond the usual family get-togethers. All I remember is how lovely it was to live alone, not to see myself reflected in Ellen every morning, to make friends who didn’t know her. Then I met Olaf, and my ambivalent feelings towards her suddenly seemed excessive and childish, and she and I grew closer. When Agnar and Hedda were born, those old feelings became nothing but the faintest of flickers, reminding me of how things used to be.A Modern Family: The cover choices!!!Cover 1 (tree):Cover 2 (cutlery):So which is it to be? Leave a comment below - Cover 1 or Cover 2. OR if you're on Twitter, tweet Cover 1 or Cover 2 with the #AModernFamily hashtag to @OrendaBooks and, if you remember, tag me in - @VictoriaGoldma2. We will be asking on Twitter as well so also look for our tweets.  A Modern Family: Read about author Helga FlatlandHelga Flatland is already one of Norway’s most awarded and widely read authors.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Louisa de Lange", "date": "Friday 5 October 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome LOUISA DE LANGEto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSWhen I was growing up I read a lot of Stephen King. While not strictly crime, they are a master class in writing thrilling, gripping stories. And I loved the element of something different - things were never as they seemed at first glance. This was a huge influence when I came to putting my own pen to paper, and these aspects have sneaked through for both The Dream Wife and my second novel, Double Take.... FILMS/MOVIESI love a good story, clever dialogue, a twist that makes me gasp, and preferably a romance thrown in, so Ocean’s 11 has to be at the top for me as one of the best crime capers out there. And Brad Pitt and George Clooney together in one movie doesn’t hurt either…... TV DRAMASI have just started rewatching Castle, and remembering how unashamedly beautifully cheesy it is. A mystery writer teams up with a New York detective to solve murders! I love a bit of easy escapism and this is definitely that.Away from the cheese, I’m a devotee to NCIS (all versions), Criminal Minds, CSI  (all versions, always on repeat), Elementary, Blindspot, The Mentalist, Bones and most recently, Killing Eve. Stick a handsome-slash-beautiful troubled FBI agent-slash-homicide detective in the plot and I’m there! (And yes, I do watch a lot of television!)... FICTIONAL KILLERSPatrick Bateman. I read American Psycho while I was at university and didn’t dare go out for a week. Patrick Bateman was such a terrifying misogynistic psychopath, he has stuck with me ever since. And I’ve never dared read it again. Then, of course, there’s the debate around the ending, which I loved for its ambiguity and skill.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I love anything written by Kate Atkinson, but especially the Jackson Brodie novels. Kate Atkinson has a way of creating characters so rich in believable detail, down to the smallest observations about a person, that I couldn’t help be swept up in him and his investigations.... MURDER WEAPONSRoald Dahl’s darker side is often very clear in his children’s books but I have always loved the macabre short story from Tales of the Unexpected where a wife kills her husband with a leg of lamb, then cooks it and serves it to the police officer investigating his murder. It’s so brilliantly cold and calculating!    ... DEATH SCENESI would have to say the death of Brad Pitt’s wife in Se7en, poor old Gwyneth, is one that sticks in my mind. It isn’t a death you see on screen, but it’s certainly one of the most shocking and heart breaking I can remember – and also so integral for the plot. I remember everyone in the cinema shouting, “Don’t look in the box, Brad! Don’t look in the box!”  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI always get a clear idea of what my characters and locations are like when I’m writing, and I find Pinterest is a great place to collect all these images together. It then acts as inspiration when I get stuck and a reference for anything descriptive. It’s also a wonderful way to procrastinate so I do have to be careful. Too many hours lost getting distracted!... WRITING TIPSJust write! I find the writing process very organic, and the ideas and inspiration doesn’t seem to flow until I’m actually getting words down on the page. Then once the first draft is done I’ll rip it all apart, plan my chapters and make sure the story I want to tell makes sense. But getting those words down is the first step, and often the hardest, mentally.... WRITING SNACKSWriting is not a great profession for the waistline, so I try to avoid smuggling food into my study. (Especially chocolate. Definitely chocolate.) However, a cup of tea is my constant companion. It’s always a good excuse to take me away from the desk and have a think - many a plot line has been worked through standing by a boiling kettle.About LOUISA DE LANGELouisa de Lange is a freelance copywriter, mum of a little boy and a keen runner, blogger and photographer.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Guy Bolton", "date": "Thursday 4 October 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome GUY BOLTONto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSDennis Lehane. A lot of crime writers are happy to stick to their detective character series but Lehane has managed to combine that with some really top-notch standalone thrillers. Being a film lover, I’ve enjoyed the movie adaptations of his books but Mystic River, Live By Night, Gone Baby Gone and Shutter Island are also brilliant novels in their own right. If anything he’s just one of the best literary thriller writers out there today.... FILMS/MOVIESMy Jonathan Craine novels are about Hollywood in the ‘30s and ‘40s so obviously movies have had a big influence on my writing. I’m a big fan of classic noirs and Out of the Past was one of the early inspirations for The Syndicate. I notice a lot of people say my writing style is very cinematic and I think big bold crime films like LA Confidential, The Godfather, Heat and All the President’s Men have really helped shape my thrillers.... TV DRAMASI’m a big fan of David Simon generally but The Wire has had a huge impact on me. It demonstrated the ability of the crime genre to be entertaining and thrilling whilst asking serious questions about society. That was a big influence on my new novel The Syndicate. It couldn’t recommend it highly enough.... FICTIONAL KILLERSPatrick Bateman. American Psycho is grim reading but the first one hundred pages or so are really more of a blackly comic satire on wealth and ‘80s excess than anything else. I find the book endlessly quotable. And for someone so absolutely heinous, there’s something indescribably empathetic about Patrick. That’s some achievement.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Martin Cruz Smith’s investigator Arkady Renko. My uncle introduced me to Gorky Park and Polar Star and he’s without doubt my favourite detective. It’s his black sense of humour that I like more than anything. It’s something I’ve tried to instill in my protagonist Jonathan Craine. Whatever the circumstances, however bad things get, I like to think he can just about see the funny side of things.... MURDER WEAPONSGarrote. Craine faces one in The Syndicate. I mean can you imagine anything worse?    ... DEATH SCENESI’ll refer again to American Psycho. Some are quite funny. But other scenes are so horrific I that I have to stop reading. Even thinking about it now I’m starting to feel queasy…  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m a bit of a luddite. I tend to scan through Wikipedia for general research and then from there find books and sources I can track down in the British Library. I’m pretty old school at times. For The Syndicate I spent a lot of time reading old newspaper clippings on the microfilm reader.... WRITING TIPSLots of writers talk about skill and craft but the discipline to write regularly and consistently is probably key when you’re starting out. Particularly for those with full time jobs and / or families. It’s a lot like exercise, you really just need to find the time and ask those around you to be supportive of it. After that it simply becomes routine. Even if you wrote a thousand words a week, you’d have a book in two years. That’s not bad going by any means. ... WRITING SNACKSBananas and nuts to keep me going between meals. But I’m a tea addict - I’ll easily put away 5 cups a day.

{"title": "A Noise Downstairs by Linwood Barclay", "date": "Wednesday 3 October 2018", "text": "A Noise Downstairsby Linwood BarclayPublished by Orion (12 July 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionEVERY STEP...Paul Davis forgets things - he gets confused, he has sudden panic attacks. But he wasn't always like this.TAKES YOU CLOSER...Eight months ago, Paul found two dead bodies in the back of a co-worker's car. He was attacked, left for dead, and has been slowly recovering ever since. His wife tries her best but fears the worst...TO THE TRUTH...Therapy helps during the days, but at night he hears things - impossible things - that no one else can. That nobody else believes. Either he's losing his mind - or someone wants him to think he is.Just because he's paranoid doesn't mean it's not happening...My verdictLinwood Barclay is one of my favourite authors and has been for many years. A Noise Downstairs was yet another dark read, hooking me from the first page, with his brilliant storytelling, great pace and unreliable characters.I'm loving creepy crime thrillers at the moment, and this one was particularly addictive and compelling. Some moments were spine-tingly chilling, providing a strong mix of murder, macabre and ghostly goings-on - with plenty of 'bumps in the night'.I raced through A Noise Downstairs and devoured it within a couple of hours. It's very twisty and certainly kept me on my toes, with an OMG moment - a twist that I genuinely didn't see coming. This book definitely messed with my mind and made my head swirl with shock.Yet again, as with many crime thrillers, it's very hard to review without giving anything away, so this review is very much about my reactions rather than the plot. If you want to know about the plot, read the blurb and then buy (and read) the book!"},

The Tattoo Thief was published by Trapeze on 20 September 2018. Read on for my review...The Tattoo ThiefBy Alison BelshamPublished by Trapeze (20 September 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy of the book from the publisherPublisher's descriptionA policeman on his first murder caseA tattoo artist with a deadly secretAnd a twisted serial killer sharpening his blades to kill again...When Brighton tattoo artist Marni Mullins discovers a flayed body, newly-promoted DI Francis Sullivan needs her help. There's a serial killer at large, slicing tattoos from his victims' bodies while they're still alive. Marni knows the tattooing world like the back of her hand, but has her own reasons to distrust the police. So when she identifies the killer's next target, will she tell Sullivan or go after the Tattoo Thief alone?My verdictThe Tattoo Thief is a cleverly plotted serial killer thriller.There's a killer on the loose, targeting the tattooing community, flaying live victims to slice off (and preserve) their tattoos. I don't know much about the tattooing world, but it seemed authentic and I not only learnt a lot but also found it fascinating, to the point of 'Googling' the art of tattoos. The author has clearly done her research and portrayed tattooing convincingly, including the prejudice of outsiders and the sense of community.Two strong leading characters here - DI Francis Sullivan (new to his job, young for his job, desperate to prove his worth, not as confident as he could be, Catholic, doesn't understand why anyone would want a tattoo) and tattoo artist Marni Mullins (determined, feisty and slightly 'damaged' with a colourful past). I found myself wanting both of them to succeed, holding my breath in various places, hoping they would be 'okay'. And I loved the interaction between them - two very different people, working together (unofficially) towards the same goal of catching a serial killer.The Tattoo Thief is a gruesome and graphic in places, detailing the processes involved in flaying victims and preserving tattoos - perfect for my love of gore and forensics/science. The plot moves at a cracking pace, with plenty of intrigue and cliffhangers to keep me turning just one more page, and the serial killer chapters were suitably chilling and creepy.A great debut, and I look forward to seeing what's next.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome KAREN SULLIVANPublisheratOrenda BooksWhat and when was your first job in publishing?I worked as secretary to the editorial director of Sidgwick & Jackson, and my ‘line manager’ was Gill Paul, now a well-known author of historical fiction. She effectively trained me, and I moved to editorial assistant and the some commissioning.How long have you been working in your current job/role?I am publisher and owner of Orenda Books, and we are almost four years old. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?We are always working on a number of books at different stages. I just did a final read of Susi Holliday’s utterly brilliant psychological thriller cum ghost story, The Lingering, before we go to press and I’m about to do the same to Will Carver’s dark, sexy, tense Good Samaritans. I’m doing final edits on West Camel’s beautiful, charming debut Attend,  which is a bit Armistead Maupin … all character and lyrical writing. I’m also preparing Steph Broadribb’s Deep Dirty Truth, next in the fabulous single-mother, bounty-hunter Lori Anderson series, and Matt Wesolowski’s creepy Changeling, next in the Six Stories series, for bound proofs. I’m structurally editing books that we are publishing well into next year, like Doug Johnstone’s FABULOUS Breakers. It’s gloriously non-stop and never boring!Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I have a couple of degrees, including English, Economics and Psychology, which probably help! I took a publishing course at the beginning of my career, and was rigorously trained in my first job. I am a huge reader, too, and that obviously helps with story sense, and working on the structure of a book. I was a non-fiction author for years, writing about raising children and emotional health, and did some TV, etc. This gives good insights from the other side of the fence, if you like. I was a single mother for a number of years, supporting my boys on my own, so I have always been hugely disciplined and determined, and very good at time management. Mainly, though, I think I am really just very lucky to be doing a job that I adore, and working with so many talented authors from around the world. They are SO much fun, too. It’s a fabulous job!How do you relax after a busy working day?Reading is my main relaxation, always. Spending time with my family is also fun. I don’t go out a lot because my job involves a LOT of travel and a LOT of events, festivals and parties. I am happiest in my nightie, on the sofa. I don’t watch a lot of TV, but I have to say that the current crop of drama on at the moment is brilliant! I’m glued to The Bodyguard and enjoying The Truth about the Harry Quebert Affair, and I can’t wait for the dramatisation of Helen FitzGerald’s The Cry.What was the last book you read for pleasure?Currently reading Ambrose Parry’s The Way of All Flesh, and I honestly can’t recommend it highly enough. It’s beautifully written, visceral, immersive, authentic, screamingly tense and quite magnificent. Ambrose Parry is the writing team of Chris Brookmyre and his doctor wife, Marisa. Enough said! On the TBR, I’ve got Laura Shepherd-Robinson’s debut Blood & Sugar, which everyone is talking about! Plus Erin Kelly’s Stone Mothers. I LOVE HER WORK!Describe your job in 15 words or less...Commissioning exceptional books from around the world, and editing, marketing, selling and promoting them in all formats (which is more than 15).What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farThere have been some great highlights! One of our first books was Ragnar Jonasson’s Snowblind, translated by Quentin Bates, and it was the first book to knock The Girl on the Train off the top of the kindle charts. That was MAGIC for a debut, international author. Ragnar’s series has gone on to sell about a million copies worldwide. It was an honour to be shortlisted (twice) for Best Newcomer at the Independent Publishing Awards, and to be chosen as a Bookseller Rising Star. A seminal moment was launching Roxanne Bouchard’s We Were the Salt of the Sea (translated from French Canadian by David Warriner) at Canada House earlier this year. I’m Canadian, and the word ‘Orenda’ is a Canadian First Nations word that loosely translates as ‘the mystical power that drives human accomplishment’, so it was extremely exciting. I was bursting with pride! Otherwise, every single day, every book, every author has brought incredible rewards and multiple highlights. I’m as excited about a book selling thousands of copies as I am by a great reader review!If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I wouldn’t want to do anything else. This is, quite honestly, my dream job!If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?The Orenda, but Joseph Boyden already did that! JSometimes my life feels like a thriller, with so many nail-biting, tense moments, and a roller-coaster plot, coupled with elation, distress, pride, happiness, euphoria … and some incredible characters!

But her luck, and the kindness of strangers, have run out.The arrival of a visitor from her distant past shocks Cordelia. She reacts violently to the intrusion and flees her flat to spend a drunken night at a glittering party. As dawn breaks she stumbles home through the back streets. Even before she opens her door she can hear the flies buzzing. She did not expect the corpse inside to start decomposing quite so quickly . . .My verdictSkin Deep left me cold and shaking - with shock, horror, admiration, or maybe a combination of all three. Every so often, I’ll read a book and discover a protagonist I love to hate. Well Liz Nugent has, yet again, created such a character.Delia is a monster, that’s the word that popped into my head first when thinking about how to describe her. She is manipulative, self-centred and dangerous. She makes her mark on everyone she comes into contact with. In fact, she leaves disaster and shattered lives in her wake.Skin Deep is an in-depth psychological character study - a look at whether evil is created or inborn, nature or nurture. I won’t give the plot away, though Delia IS the plot and Skin Deep is as dark as you can get. We know from the start that Delia has killed someone, but who and why?This multi-layered book is compelling and addictive, macabre and twisted, impossible to put down. It reads like a memoir, in the first person, getting right inside Delia’s mind, something that Liz Nugent does extremely well. I didn’t want it to end - and that ending really was a shocker yet felt totally appropriate.Skin Deep provided great escapism from my life into someone else’s - and her life will be very hard to forget!"},
{"title": "Killer Women Weekend - Talking to Sarah Hilary, Mel McGrath and Kate Rhodes", "date": "Thursday 20 September 2018", "text": "On Sunday October 21st, 2018, the Killer Women are taking over the Courtrooms above Browns Restaurant in London' Covent Garden, with events about crime novels, crime audio, crime television and true crime. But that's enough from me. Here are three of the Killer Women to tell you what influences their own writing and why this year's Killer Women Festival 2018 is the place to be!Sarah HilarySarah is author of the Marnie Rome series. She will be chairing the Fresh Blood panel at the Killer Women Festival (16.30-17.30).1. Which crime fiction author or novel has influenced your own writing the most?Am I allowed an author and a novel? The author would be Patricia Highsmith. There's something about her writing - so smooth and cool on the surface but it tangles you up and ties you to her world so utterly - which I'm always trying to unravel and from which I'm always learning. The novel would be Rebecca. I re-read it recently, and it struck me all over again just how much it affected me as a reader, and a budding writer. I first read it the summer I turned eleven, which I always thought was the ideal age to read it - as a young adolescent - but I enjoyed it hugely this last time, and took so much more from it than I ever have before. The emotion, the psychology, the atmospherics; it really is a masterpiece of storytelling.2. Have you found a particular non-fiction book to be essential to (or influence) your own writing?I'm a big fan of true crime. Most recently I enjoyed This House of Grief by Helen Garner, about a murder trial in Australia. It was utterly compelling, and almost unendurably real. The non-fiction book I've returned to most often when writing the Marnie Rome series is The Eye: A Human History by Simon Ing, for everything it has to say about the psychology of seeing and how we witness the world.3. In 10 words or less, how would you describe Killer Women Festival 2018?Ten tense, thrilling and tremendous hours for lovers of crime.Mel McGrathMel's most recently book is a psychological thriller called Give Me the Child. She will be chairing the Sex Crime: Writing Sex in the #MeToo Age panel at the Killer Women Festival (10.15-11.15).1. Which crime fiction author or novel has influenced your own writing the most?I really can't just name one, but Barbara Vine and Patricia Highsmith both come to mind2. Have you found a particular non-fiction book to be essential to (or influence) your own writing?Really early on, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. In the last couple of years probably Helen Garner's This House of Grief. Both brilliant non-fiction books about the impact of crime as much as about the crime itself.3. In 10 words or less, how would you describe Killer Women Festival 2018? Friendly, inclusive festival programmed by authors with readers in mind.Kate RhodesKate Rhodes is author of the Alice Quentin crime series and, most recently, the Hell Bay series.1. Which crime fiction author or novel has influenced your own writing the most?It’s horribly difficult to choose just one, but if those are the rules, I’ll pick Brighton Rock, by Graham Greene. I read it in my early teens, when it just seemed like a thrilling story, full of gangsters and danger. It’s only as an adult that I realise how beautifully woven the plot is, and that it works as a moral fable, with brilliant use of language. 2. Have you found a particular non-fiction book to be essential to (or influence) your own writing?I tend to use websites, not printed materials when doing research, opting for specialist sites written by experts and updated regularly. My most recent book is about deep sea diving, so I combed the internet, looking for information on techniques, instead of putting on a diving suit myself! 3. In 10 words or less, how would you describe Killer Women Festival 2018?A friendly, brilliant collection of crime-related events, open to everyone.Find out moreThis year's Killer Women Festival features bestselling authors, police experts, forensic scientists and criminologists.

{"title": "Jean Levy's Writing Toolkit", "date": "Monday 17 September 2018", "text": "WRITING TOOLKIT gives you an idea of an author's writing process through the tools they use. The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome JEAN LEVYAUTHOR OF WHAT WAS LOSTTO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITFOR HER BLOG TOURWhat Was Lost was published on 13 September 2018 by The Dome Press.Where I writeMostly, I can write any place, any time. I have few requirements. I suppose it comes of years of leaving things to the last minute: homework on the school bus, research reports scribbled on the train, editorials dispatched as the deadline closes. That history of brinkmanship, of just scraping in under the wire, means that I’m not that fussy about chaos.This is the dining table in my flat. It’s one of two places that I do my writing. Needless to say, we eat out a lot. The other place I write is the family barn. There’s a bigger table there, but there’s also a large bath and that’s probably one of my essentials. If I’m about to start a new sequence, introduce a new character or put the finishing touches to a critical conversation, I run a really hot bath, infused with a Seaweed and Arnica concoction that Father Christmas brings me every year (he gets it from Neal’s Yard). I think the combination of heat and fragrance helps me focus. Probably an increased blood supply to the brain, although I prefer not to think about that. Obviously, on these occasions I have to resort to traditional writing methods: sheets of A4 paper folded twice and an inky pen that writes upside down. (Do not attempt this bath-writing using electronic devices. Dunking iPads/mobiles into an infusion of seaweed and arnica never goes well.)And those critical conversations … I rehearse them way before bath time, whilst weeding, whilst staring out the flat window at the Cathedral, whilst driving. The floor of my car is littered with quick notes scribbled on till receipts and parking tickets. Of course, silence is essential. I can’t expect my characters to have conversations with noise going on around them. In fact, I mostly can’t write surrounded by noise: the TV, seagulls, pneumatic drills, dripping taps, and definitely not music. Music imposes emotions and sometimes those emotions are not appropriate to what I’m writing.Wine, foodWine is not really essential, although I find a glass of prosecco always encourages creativity. Or a Pinotage when it’s cold outside. And I don’t really eat during the day, just cups of tea/coffee and the occasional bowl of pistachio ice cream.Apps, books, softwareApart from the till receipts and the soggy bath notes, I write directly onto my laptop and back up on a flash drive (constantly), an external hard drive (occasionally) and by sending myself an email attachment (daily). I write in Word, the enemy that know. I search/check using Google and an online dictionary and thesaurus. As far as creative writing books are concerned, I had my fill of those during a Creative Writing degree. They are often a bit flaky, although some are good regarding plot, characters, dialogue. I’d recommend Stephen King’s ‘On Writing’. But I’ve found that the best sources for writing technique are books on basic narratology:Cobley, P. (2001). Narrative: The New Critical Idiom. Routledge, Oxford.Martin, W. (1986). Recent Theories of Narrative. Cornell University Press, Ithaca.There are many others more recent than that. And there’s a good website I’ve used:http://www2.anglistik.uni-freiburg.de/intranet/englishbasics/Discourse01.htmThe major considerations for any writer are plot, character, location, time and tense, sequence, description versus action, pace, use of dialogue, point of view, status of the narrator and narrative focus, but their expression rests upon good grammar and I’m a bit of a pedant when it comes to that. It’s a result of seven years of research into temporal linguistics … but that’s another story. David Crystal has written some very readable books on basic grammar. ‘The Elements of Style’ by Strunk, White and Kalman bridges the gap between creativity and serious grammar, and there’s always Lynne Truss’s  ‘Eats, Shoots and Leaves’.By far the best way of realising writing techniques is to read good writers: Sebastian Faulks, Virginia Woolf, Ian McEwan and James Joyce for the beauty of their words, Margaret Atwood for her parallel and non-linear plots, Angela Carter for her imagery, Winterson for her experimental and challenging narratives, Philip Pullman for sheer imagination, Douglas Adams for his humour, and Jane Austen as the pioneer of the techniques of psychonarration.Social mediaI’m not a big fan of Twitter, although I’m going to try harder. I visit Facebook most days, but I find myself watching YouTube dog and cat and Trump videos. And that gets you nowhere.Exercise and other alien activitiesI don’t really do sport, gym, jogging, running. I haven’t got time. Although I know people who strongly recommend such things.CharactersI’ve often been asked where my characters come from. Well, apart from the occasional evil antagonist, they are hybrids of people I have known. The arrogance, dithering, mendacity, the eccentricities and outrageous affectations, love and friendships I have portrayed in What Was Lost are all drawn from experience.TimeI suppose the actual process of writing is the result of days, even weeks of mulling things around in my mind, and I find the best time to do that is in the dark, in bed, before I go to sleep. When you’ve given up on everything else and your time’s your own. However, I learned long ago that those perfect plot solutions can disappear overnight, so if I do think of something inspirational I grope for my phone and make a note of it. Just a word or two to jog my memory.As far as time managing my writing is concerned, I have to admit that I would write all day long. And sometimes I do. Sometimes I reach a point in the plot which refuses to be paused. I have occasionally written through the night, stopping only to accept my morning cup of tea. My husband is very understanding. I can remember, a few years back, taking part in the NaNoWriMo Challenge … just writing all day, every day. I lost all sense of time. It was great, although I realised on one occasion that, for the first time in my adult life, I had started a day, ended a day and proceeded to the next day without having a shower in between. I suppose what I’m saying is I don’t not write. Only when something prevents me from doing so.THANKS FOR TAKING PART, JEAN!About Jean LevyJean spent several years in genetics research before abandoning the laboratory to pursue a career in academic publishing both in Holland and the UK.

He seems to understand her - almost as if he knows her...As she fights to regain her memories and her sense of self, it is clear that people are hiding things from her. Who are they protecting? Does Sarah really want the truth?My verdictWhat Was Lost is a beautifully written psychological thriller covering themes of memory, identity and discovery.The book is based on a frightening concept - losing your adult memories, so that all that remain are those of your childhood. This is what's happened to Sarah, after she was found, alone and badly injured, on a beach far away from home. She can't remember her friends, family, loved ones or colleagues. She's in a child-like state - physically an adult, but emotionally that of a young girl. She's learning how to live again, doing simple tasks and taking on responsibilities, questioning everything around her, including herself. At the same time, her doctors are hiding the facts about her life, trying to find out whether her memories will return on their own. And more importantly, trying to establish whether her memory loss is real or not.Most of the story is told through Sarah's point of view, so the reader is relying on her experience of current events. I wasn't sure how easily she could be trusted from the start - you can't get a more unreliable narrator than someone with no memories. But then as she began to question everything around her, I wondered if maybe no one else could be trusted either. The author clearly knows her science as this is present in abundance, as Sarah's doctors and counsellors cushion, control and experiment to learn more about memories and the impact of amnesia. And then there are the police, lurking in the background, desperate to know the truth about what happened to Sarah and some recent tragic events.What Was Lost is a slow burner, and I admit that it took me a little while to get into the story. But I soon found myself savouring the wonderful prose and stunning vivid descriptions, down to the finer detail of Sarah's life. I loved the London setting and little insights into the publishing industry.There's plenty of mystery and intrigue, as gradually snippets of Sarah's past are tossed into the arena, like little sparks lighting up her fog-filled mind. I can't say much about the other people in the book as they are all carefully, cleverly and gradually revealed one by one, like shadowy figures on the side of a stage awaiting their cue. The reader is as much in the dark as Sarah, relying on these characters to fill in some of the memory gaps.What Was Lost is a compelling literary read - an in-depth multilayered psychological thriller based on science that's designed to question, explore and entertain."},

The Wire contains some of my favourite characters in any form of drama, whether on the page or the screen. Bunk, Omar, McNulty, Lester, Kima, Snoop. I miss them!... FICTIONAL KILLERSNorman Bates. Take your pick if you want Robert Bloch’s cold, sweaty misogynist or Hitchcock’s more sympathetic - but just as deadly - movie variation. Either way this mummy’s boy is the stuff of enduring nightmares, a killer for the ages. That his name so immediately resonates nearly sixty years later is testament to his chilling creation.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES John Rebus. Gruff and dour, a pint in one hand and a smoke in the other, carrying the reminders of every glove that laid him down, Rebus was the blueprint for so many that came after. Brilliantly crafted by Ian Rankin, Rebus is the first cop you’d want on your side. An old devil on the side of the angels, he’d also be my first choice to go for a beer with.... MURDER WEAPONSI’m struggling to think of anything unusual so I’m going to cheat and use one of my own. In my debut Random, all the crimes had to be out of the ordinary to ensure media attention. One victim had a rolled up newspaper stuffed down their throat, another was frozen to death, one had his mouth taped and nostrils glued together. My personal favourite is probably the unfortunate supermarket worker who was administered pure liquid nicotine and came to a very messy and undignified end on Till 18. My murders have probably been more mundane - but more meaningful - since then, although my new book is set to change that again.    ... DEATH SCENESThe most traumatic remains the shooting of Bambi’s mother. If there was one crime, factual or fictional, that I’d like to see solved and the murderer brought to justice, it would be this. Forget Jack the Ripper, the Black Dahlia or even who really shot JFK, I want that hunter named, shamed and strapped to Old Sparky till his sideburns sizzle.I was taken to see Bambi in a cinema that has long since been torn down when I was about five. I cried. A lot.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESGoogle Maps. YouTube. Hidden Glasgow. 28 Days Later (an urban exploring site). These are some of my most used websites for research, whether it’s for finding houses, pubs, how-to advice or fun new murder sites.... WRITING TIPSDon’t write what you know. Write what you care about. ... WRITING SNACKSI frequently forget to eat when I’m writing. I actually have a very bad habit of forgetting to stand, eat or go to the toilet. Subsequently, my legs don’t always work when I eventually remember to take a break or finish for the night. So, if I have to pick a writing snack, I think it might be a shiraz or a rioja.About CRAIG ROBERTSONCraig Robertson is a Sunday Times bestselling author, and his debut novel, Random, was shortlisted for the CWA New Blood Dagger.

{"title": "In Bloom by CJ Skuse", "date": "Wednesday 12 September 2018", "text": "In BloomBy CJ SkusePublished by HQ (9 August 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionIf only they knew the real truth. It should be my face on those front pages. My headlines. I did those things, not him. I just want to stand on that doorstep and scream it: IT WAS ME. ME. ME. ME. ME!Rhiannon Lewis has successfully fooled the world and framed her cheating fiancé Craig for the depraved and bloody killing spree she committed. She should be ecstatic that she’s free.Except for one small problem. She’s pregnant with her ex lover’s child. The ex-lover she only recently chopped up and buried in her in-laws garden. And as much as Rhiannon wants to continue making her way through her kill lists, a small voice inside is trying to make her stop.But can a killer’s urges ever really be curbed?My verdictSweetpea was one of my favourite books of 2017 - a perfect serial killer read filled with dark humour. In Bloom follows on from the moment Sweetpea ends, with Rhiannon pregnant and in a serious spot of bother. I really didn't think CJ Skuse could top Sweetpea, but she certainly has. In Bloom is evil and dark, with plenty of shocks and surprises, and is certainly not for the faint-hearted. It's also emotional and even heartbreaking in places, as Rhiannon tries to come to terms with her impending motherhood and make some decisions about her future.Yet again, I found myself rooting for Rhiannon when I really shouldn't, getting a better understanding of her background and why she's the way she is. While she appears fairly 'normal' on the outside with her love of her dog Tink and her Sylvanians collection, she's certainly not a 'people person' - although she has now made a friend, of sorts, called Marnie. The question that arises throughout the book is whether Rhiannon is 'mother material'.The book reads like a totally twisted pregnancy guide. Rhiannon describes all of her aches and pains, angst and worries, as you would expect in any pregnancy, but then there are also her murderous tendencies and psychotic urges. Fortunately (or not so fortunately for her), she now has a conscience - her unborn baby. The book is cleverly (and hilariously) written as 'baby' makes Rhiannon choose between being a mother and being a murderer every time she 'gets the serial killer urge'.In Bloom is another fantastic read from CJ Skuse, as long as you don't mind bad language, graphic descriptions and some uncomfortable reading! This book sets the scene perfectly for another book (although it does tie up loose ends too) and I'm now desperate to know what happens next!"},
{"title": "The After Wife by Cass Hunter", "date": "Friday 7 September 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for The After Wife by Cass Hunter. The After Wife was published by Trapeze Books on 6th September 2018. Read on for my review...The After WifeBy Cass HunterPublished by Trapeze Books (6 September 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher Publisher's descriptionWhen Rachel and Aidan fell in love, they thought it was forever.She was a brilliant, high-flying scientist. He was her loving and supportive husband.Now she's gone, and Aidan must carry on and raise their daughter alone.But Rachel has left behind her life's work, a gift of love to see them through the dark days after her death.A gift called iRachel.My verdictThe After Wife is a bittersweet novel about humanity, identity, love and grief - and I loved it.I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book, as I hadn't actually read the blurb, but sometimes it's better to dive in without any preconceptions. It didn't take long to immerse myself into the lives of Rachel, Aidan and Chloe - ordinary lives that became so extraordinary when tragedy struck. I found myself whizzing through the pages, following the family's emotional journey as iRachel became part of the household.Beautifully written, this is a compelling and unique story with a modern twist - a well-crafted book that made me laugh, cry and think about the meaning of life. Despite being set in a slightly more technologically-advanced future, it all seemed very credible and believable, and the science was written seamlessly into the story. I was drawn to the contrast between iRachel, learning how to be independent, create memories and live as a human, and Aidan's mother, Sinead, whose dementia was slowly taking away her own memories, humanity and independence.The After Wife is a thought-provoking read - a book that creates more questions than it answers. I've recently been watching the TV series Westworld, which also has humanoid robots at its heart and had already prompted so many questions. What makes us human? What gives us our unique identity? What makes us able to love those around us? Can we truly learn to experience emotion? How much do our memories and life experiences shape us?I knew that however it ended, The After Wife would bring tears to my eyes. And it certainly did, along with a lump in my throat.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Brothers in Blood by Amer Anwar", "date": "Thursday 6 September 2018", "text": "Brothers in BloodBy Amer AnwarPublished by Dialogue BooksI received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionA Sikh girl on the run. A Muslim ex-con who has to find her. A whole heap of trouble. Southall, West London. After being released from prison, Zaq Khan is lucky to land a dead-end job at a builders' yard. All he wants to do is keep his head down and put the past behind him.But when Zaq is forced to search for his boss's runaway daughter, he quickly finds himself caught up in a deadly web of deception, murder and revenge. With time running out and pressure mounting, can he find the missing girl before it's too late? And if he does, can he keep her - and himself - alive long enough to deal with the people who want them both dead?My verdictBrothers in Blood is gritty, dark, violent and lots of fun.This action-packed crime thriller is set in the Asian community in Southall. I can't say for sure whether or not this is authentic, as I don't know the area at all. But it certainly felt it, as Amer Anwar led me along the cultural tightrope in this close-knit community, with reference to languages, foods, family life and clashes between local Sikhs and Muslims.The plot centres around Zaq Khan, who has been released from prison (after an unfortunate incident) and is trying to keep his head down. He's forced to turn private eye when his Sikh boss Mr Brar tasks him with finding his daughter Rita, who has run off with a Muslim man. Zaq tries to refuse the job, but Mr Brar gives him no choice - threatening to send him back to prison using false allegations.As Zaq explores every aspect of Rita's life, he realises her disappearance isn't as clear cut as it seems and he's putting his life in danger. He has to think fast, act fast and talk fast to get himself out of several precarious situations. The book isn't for the faint-hearted, with some well-described fight scenes. I don't think I'll ever look at lemons and chilli powder in the same way again - ouch! It's also filled with comedic moments and plenty of warmth, thanks to the interactions between Zaq and his best friend Jags.Brothers in Blood may be a bit far fetched in places but this just added to the pace, resulting in a gripping climax. This would be perfect for the small or big screen, with its fight scenes, car chases, well-plotted storyline, larger-than-life characters and sharp dialogue. The book covers fresh, contemporary themes - a novel of modern day Britain - and taught me a lot about different Asian cultures. Highly recommended!"},
{"title": "Crime Fiction Coach - a new service from four leading crime authors!!", "date": "Tuesday 4 September 2018", "text": "Writing fiction can be a daunting experience, and many writers (unpublished and published) often welcome a helping hand.Thanks to four brilliant, experienced crime fiction authors -Steph Broadribb, Susi Holliday, AK Benedict & Louise Voss -there's a new coaching service focusing specifically on writing crime fiction. Crime Fiction Coach can help you through all stages of the writing process:gathering together your thoughts and ideasfinding the writing process that works for youkeeping you motivatedwriting a first draftwading through the editing processoffering honest constructive critiquecreating a polished manuscript to submit to agents and publishers. I've been fortunate enough to gather these four authors together to find out more about Crime Fiction Coach and how it can provide advice, guidance and support.Why did the four of you set up Crime Fiction Coach - and did anything in particular prompt this decision?We set up Crime Fiction Coach because we know what it's like to be just starting out writing your first novel, or having written a novel not being sure what to do next, and we wanted to make a place for those people to come and get advice and support. We also wanted to create something that is flexible to individual needs - yes we do standard coaching programmes, critiques and writing packages, but we also recognise that everyone is different and so we can create a programme or package that's tailored for a person's needs if our standard services aren't hitting the spot.Who is Crime Fiction Coach aimed at?Crime Fiction Coach is aimed at people who want to write, whether they're at the very start of their writing project (or not sure how to start) all the way through to getting their final draft and submission package ready for agents and publishers. Do you think writing crime fiction requires additional or different skills to writing in other genres?If we’re talking commercial genre fiction overall, then the elements are quite similar – bestselling books are generally hooky, well-paced and written in a way that makes you want to keep turning the pages. Crime fiction does have some additional elements – namely suspense, mystery and often psychological elements of both the good and the bad guys. If you’re writing commercial fiction of any sort, then your main aim has to be to keep the reader hooked throughout. In crime, it’s about that, plus leaving clues, red herrings and creating satisfying ways to murder people that serve as entertainment rather than purely exploitative gore. Also, there are so many sub-genres of crime fiction, that it’s often the case that you read a book that is not billed as crime, but still contains many similar elements. I think the four of us specialise in crime because we prefer the darker side of storytelling. Why are the four of you ideal for the job?! Steph Broadribb\"I write two series - one US set action thriller, and one UK police procedural - and have a background in coaching. I'm passionate about working with writers at all stages of their journey and use a range of coaching techniques to help you free your creative thinking and move forward to achieve your ambition. I love a fast-paced page turner and my strength is in supporting writers who are writing for the commercial fiction market.\"Susi Holliday\"I’m still juggling a day job with writing and other commitments, so I know how hard it is to find the time to write and stay motivated when you feel under pressure – this is something that I think I can help others to work out in their own way, to make sure you stay on track with everything and don’t get totally overwhelmed.\"AK Benedict\"I have over ten years' experience in coaching writers, guiding them from their tentative first drafts to finished, often published, novel or script.\"Louise Voss\"We all have different strengths so whatever your writing issue, we have no doubts that one of us will be able to fix it. Personally, I love to help people bring their characters to life using great dialogue and vivid detail.\"What are you offering that other critique services don’t?There are lots of great companies offering manuscript critique services, agent submission package critique, feedback on partial and full novels – we do offer those things – but for us the focus is more about helping people along the way. The coaching element is our unique selling point. Whether you are a complete beginner and don’t know where to start, or you’ve written for a while but haven’t secured a deal yet, we can help you. Our aim is to guide you through the things that are holding you back, whether it’s time, ideas, being blocked, lacking in confidence – whatever it might be – these are the things that we are passionate about helping you with.Thanks for the insight into Crime Fiction Coach, Steph, Susi, AK and Louise!! And good luck with what looks to be a fabulous service.Visit the Crime Fiction Coach Website here to learn more and join the mailing list. You can also join the Crime Fiction Coach online writing group on Facebook (click here)."},
{"title": "Bob Fracklehurst - the man, the mystery, the meaning... by Louise Beech", "date": "Monday 3 September 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for The Lion Tamer Who Lost by Louise Beech. Louise talks about Bob Fracklehurst, a mysterious taxi driver who keeps appearing in her books! The Lion Tamer Who Lost is published by Orenda Books, and will be published in paperback on 20 September 2018.Bob Fracklehurst - the man, the mystery, the meaning...By Louise BeechAnyone who has read any of my books will have noticed a certain taxi driver who pops up again and again. Bob Fracklehurst. (Even my spellchecker recognises him!) Technically, he wasn’t in my debut, How to be Brave, but there is an unnamed taxi driver who takes Natalie home from the hospital after she gets the terrible news about her daughter Rose; I like to think that was also no-nonsense, wears-his-heart-on-his-sleeve, Yorkshireman, Bob. He just hadn’t introduced himself to me yet.In The Mountain in my Shoe, Bob was integral to Bernadette’s ability to volunteer with ten-year-old Conor, who was going through the care system and desperately needed her. Bob regularly took her across town to see the child, imparting frequent words of wisdom, very much there but never overbearing.In Maria in the Moon, he again is present for a most important journey. He drops Catherine off on the Flood Crisis Christmas night out, and delivers her home again, this time with love interest, Christopher. This comes before a major scene. The words he says to Catherine in the taxi could very well have played a part in the moment – ‘You deserve whatever makes your heart whole.’In my latest novel, The Lion Tamer Who Lost, our Bob is yet again the one who delivers two characters to one of their most important scenes; this time Ben and Andrew to the hospital. This book explores coincidences (for want of a better word – fate maybe?) and so Bob is witness again to a later reunion.And in my next novel, Star Girl?, I’ll come to that soon …Occasionally, I feel like Bob is some kind of a mystical figure. Like I didn’t even write him. He just … is. I don’t even have to force him or try and find somewhere to fit him into the novels. He naturally arrives. In his taxi. Music playing. Advice ready.Anyone who follows me on social media will see that I’m sisters with a certain Bob Fracklehurst too. She’s actually called Grace. Some years ago, before my books, she came up with this quirky name to use on Facebook instead of her own. As a nurse, she had to be careful at times about what she posted, so it was easier to employ a pseudonym. I loved it. Knew I had to use it. So when the taxi arrived to pick Bernadette up at the beginning of The Mountain in my Shoe, Bob arrived too.So will he appear next year in Star Girl? Oh yes. And he plays perhaps his biggest role so far. Are you ready for this? He gets out of the taxi. He briefly did in The Lion Tamer Who Lost, but this time it isn’t just his words that influence things. One of his actions plays a key role in changing the destiny of my main character, Stella. How he came to feature this time was quite profound – totally in keeping with the magical Bob. Last year I was in the car with the other Bob – sister Grace – and discussing with her whether he should return for Star Girl. I was about 30,000 words in and at a key scene. As we chatted back and forth, I glanced at the car in front of us. The registration plate said M900 BOB. Not only did it seem to say I had to conjure him up again, but also the year of the scene I was planning was 1990. Fate? Coincidence?Nah. Just Bob.And he may yet be back in book six that I’m 40,000 words into…            About Louise BeechLouise has been writing since she could physically hold a pen.

When it finally comes true, he wishes it hadn't…Long ago, Ben made a promise and he had a dream: to travel to Africa to volunteer at a lion reserve. When he finally makes it, it isn't for the reasons he imagined…Ben and Andrew keep meeting in unexpected places, and the intense relationship that develops seems to be guided by fate.

AUTHORSGah, this is a hard question. There are so many I love, and I am such a fickle beast that most of the time my favourite crime author is the one I’m currently reading. I know, I know – it’s a cop-out answer, but it’s the honest one!... FILMS/MOVIESThis one is easy. The Silence of the Lambs. This was the first real psychological thriller I ever saw and boy, did it make an impression. Oh my God, the tension, the cinematography, the unfolding, oh lordy, look out, look out Clarice!... TV DRAMASI seem to have a thing for retro, I have always had a soft spot for Midsomer Murders, and I have binge watched Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries more times than I would care to admit – What’s not to love about Miss Fisher, and don’t get me started on the vintage fashion, and the shoes, OMG, the shoes.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThis is a hard one to discuss without giving away massive spoilers, so I will simply say Agatha Christie’s The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I shall refer again to Miss Phryne Fisher, the charismatic, boundary pushing, charming, sophisticated, generous, empathic, liberated, adventurous, go get ‘em private detective created by Kerry Greenwood.

{"title": "After He Died by Michael J Malone", "date": "Tuesday 21 August 2018", "text": "After He DiedBy Michael J MalonePublished by Orenda Books (E-book - out now; paperback - 20 September 2018)Publisher's descriptionWhen Paula Gadd’s husband of almost thirty years dies, just days away from the seventh anniversary of their son, Christopher’s death, her world falls apart. Grieving and bereft, she is stunned when a young woman approaches her at the funeral service, and slips something into her pocket. A note suggesting that Paula’s husband was not all that he seemed…When the two women eventually meet, a series of revelations challenges everything Paula thought they knew, and it becomes immediately clear that both women’s lives are in very real danger.My verdictYet again, Michael J Malone has written a complex and compelling domestic noir thriller with a social conscience.Paula is grieving after her husband Tommy's sudden death. Without any close family of her own, she has very few people to give her any support. Tommy's death brings back memories of their son Christopher's death, seven years earlier, which led to her and Tommy growing further apart. Yet despite all of this, Paula believes they had a good marriage without any secrets. It's only when a young woman, Cara, approaches her after the funeral that Paula wonders how well she really knew her husband.After He Died kept me entertained from beginning to end. Michael J Malone gets right into the heads and hearts of all of his characters, particularly Paula and Cara, with chapters switching between the two. I felt like I was feeling Paula's emotions alongside her, experiencing her pain and anger, confusion and fear. I was just as intrigued as she was to find out what (if anything) Tommy had been up to behind her back.There is so much bubbling under the surface in After He Died. Just when I thought I had it sussed, Michael J Malone threw something else into the mix. The suspense escalates until the final crescendo - as all of the strands come together, Paula's world falls apart and things turn much more sinister. A reminder that we don’t always know the ones we love as well as we think.There are also some powerful social messages here. An insight into independent advocacy services created a sense of realism and kept the plot grounded. It provided a deeper understanding of inequality and the social divide, and how some people help to make the world a better place for those in need.After He Died is a thought-provoking read - well researched, well written and well done!"},
{"title": "The Lingering by Susi Holliday", "date": "Wednesday 15 August 2018", "text": "The LingeringBy Susi HollidayPublished by Orenda Books (Ebook - 15 September; Paperback - 15 November)Publisher's descriptionMarried couple Jack and Ali Gardiner move to a self-sufficient commune in the English Fens, desperate for fresh start. The local village is known for the witches who once resided there and Rosalind House, where the commune has been established, is a former psychiatric home, with a disturbing history.When Jack and Ali arrive, a chain of unexpected and unexplained events is set off, and it becomes clear that they are not all that they seem. As the residents become twitchy, and the villagers suspicious, events from the past come back to haunt them, and someone is seeking retribution…My verdictWriter Susi Holliday combined with publisher Orenda Books is a winning formula for me. Susi is one of my favourite authors, and I love her writing, having watched it develop from her Banktoun Trilogy crime series through to last year's festive crime novel The Deaths of December and now The Lingering, a cleverly plotted ghostly thriller that left me tingling. This certainly proves her versatility as a writer, and I can't wait to see what's coming next.I don't want to give away too much about The Lingering. For me, it was all about thrills, chills and surprises, and I wouldn't want to deprive anyone else of that experience. But I will say that it has an amazing sense of foreboding from the start and one particular 'gasp out loud' game-changing moment somewhere along the way before the end.The characters are very real, from newcomers Jack and Ali to 'Fairy' Angela and Smeaton - a group of people who have made Rosalind House their home, a self-sufficient commune where they can escape from their previous, often-troubled lives. I found myself right inside their heads, whether chapters were written in the first or third person. Susi Holliday has created one of the most 'seemingly ordinary' evil protagonists I've come across for a while. Rosalind House is a key component of the story, bringing the characters together and also the past and the present. This former psychiatric home has a disturbing history and is filled with secrets. When newcomer Ali experiences some strange happenings, it makes her (and made me, as the reader) wonder what horrors took place there, what evil lingers there and whether it is the house itself or the occupants, past or current, causing the darkness within its walls. The vivid descriptions made me feel like I was there too, experiencing some shocking moments - there are couple of scenes in particular that have remained in my head.The Lingering is a dark, creepy story delving into the true nature of evil. Is it born, taught or guided? Nature or nurture? And can you ever escape from your past mistakes? Susi Holliday has created a brilliant combination of psychological thriller and ghostly mystery - a 'chiller thriller' or 'ghostly noir'.Put this on your shopping list!"},

The crofters are suspicious and hostile to a stranger, claiming they no longer know their fireside stories. Then Audrey discovers the body of a young girl washed up on the beach and the crofters reveal that it is only a matter of weeks since another girl disappeared. They believe the girls are the victims of the restless dead: spirits who take the form of birds. Initially, Audrey is sure the girls are being abducted, but as events accumulate she begins to wonder if something else is at work. Something which may be linked to the death of her own mother, many years before.My verdictThe Story Keeper was a joy to read - magical and mythical, creepy and addictive, intriguing and tense. Anna Mazzola has carefully woven together dark fairytales and folklore with crime and social history to create a brilliant gothic mystery.Set in 1857, The Story Keeper felt authentic from the start, with vivid evocative scenes, an atmospheric, claustrophobic setting, beautifully written descriptive passages and realistic dialogue. Audrey Hart is a well-rounded protagonist - determined and focused, inquisitive and sensitive, with an unsettling past of her own. I felt like I was on the Isle of Skye in the mid-19th century, visiting those crofter cottages alongside her, learning about the locals, their culture and their beliefs and prejudices.I loved everything about this book with its subtle (and not so subtle) twists and turns. A haunting sense of unease flowed through the pages, enchanting me and sending shivers down my spine. I held my breath at various moments and gasped at others. At times, I had no idea what to believe and who to trust.Does magic exist? Through Anna's amazing writing, it certainly does. Buy the book and discover the magic for yourself!"},

AUTHORSI love moody, dark, gritty stories so I think I’m going to have to keep things European here - Ian Rankin, Stieg Larsson, Jo Nesbo, Val McDermid... all feature very high. Great characters, great plots... but crucially, I love the atmosphere these greats conjure up.... FILMS/MOVIESThe Silence of the Lambs. In all ways brilliant. I didn’t sleep well after that. I also struggled to eat chicken livers for a while. I love atmospheric so I’m going to mention Se7en. And of course I’m a sucker for twists and unreliable narrators so... The Usual Suspects is going to sneak in here as well. ... TV DRAMASNo contest - True Detective, the first season. I was hooked at the opening credits. The steamy, rural Louisiana backdrop, the horrific plot, the incredible combination of the two leads... this show helped me write. Setting took on a whole new meaning for me.... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibal Lecter. Thomas Harris, I pray at your statue every morning. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Rust Cohle from True Detective... what a character. Nihilistic, offensive ... yet incredibly good at what he does. And despite his hatred for humanity and himself, he can’t step away from his job. The whole show is pretty much about how this character develops over time. If I was murdered ... I’d want this dude on the case.... MURDER WEAPONSThe chainsaw drop in American Psycho.. clever use of a gardening tool that. More original than that other guy that just cut several people up with one in Texas.    ... DEATH SCENESWhen Leo DiCaprio’s character dies in The Departed... those lift doors open, and that bullet to the head just comes out of nowhere. Totally unexpected, incredibly powerful. As for just plain horrific... I’m just going to say... Saw. And the sequels. I hope those films don’t give anyone any ideas. They’re gross.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI haven’t actually used any yet for writing ... I usually start with a subject I have some knowledge about, or a place... and then I’ll go have a look or speak with people more in the know than me to make sure I’m on the right track. So I guess I enjoy talking to people rather than checking out the internet?... WRITING TIPSRead. Read constantly. The more you read, the more you find out what you like... and more importantly ... what you don’t like. And listen to that inner voice of yours.. because that’s how other people think too. Find it, then exaggerate it and expand it. Characters are born that way.... WRITING SNACKSCoffee. Pineapple lumps. Pancakes. Fried chicken. You can’t write on an empty stomach, can you? No. No you can’t.About NATHAN BLACKWELLNathan Blackwell was raised in Auckland, New Zealand and had a ten-year career in the New Zealand Police. Seven of those years were spent as a Detective in the Criminal Investigation Branch, where he was exposed to human nature at its strongest and bravest, but also at its most depraved and horrific. He investigated a wide range of cases including drug manufacture, child abuse, corruption, serious violence, rape, and murder. Because some of his work was conducted covertly, Nathan chooses to hide his true identity. THE SOUND OF HER VOICE is his first novel. Find Nathan Blackwell on his Facebook page.About THE SOUND OF HER VOICEPublisher's descriptionFor Detective Matt Buchanan, the world is a pretty sick place. He has probably been in the job too long, for one thing. And then there’s 14-year-old Samantha Coates, and the other unsolved murder cases. Those innocent girls he just can’t get out of his head. When Buchanan pursues some fresh leads, it soon becomes clear he’s on the trail of something big. As he pieces the horrific crimes together, Buchanan finds the very foundations of everything he once believed in start to crumble. He’s forced across that grey line that separates right and wrong – into places so dark, even he might not make it back.THE SOUND OF HER VOICE was first published in New Zealand in August 2017 (Mary Egan Publishing). It is a finalist for both Best First Novel and Best Novel in the 2018 Ngaio Marsh Awards. It will be published in the United Kingdom during 2019. Ngaio Marsh Awards judges comments“Even by cop-turned-novelist standards, this is gritty, intense and unsparing in its account of the worst humans can do to each other. It’s also shockingly polished as a well-structured thriller and a portrait of a man with right on his side and wrongdoing all around him. There is a lot to be impressed by, most of all the touching honesty of the view Blackwell allows into the mind of his protagonist – cop stories don’t come more authentic (and Kiwi) than this.”“If this is a debut then goodness gracious me. Raw, emotional, gut-wrenching in places, yet nuanced and well balanced, this is an amazing piece of work, from an under-represented perspective.”Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},
{"title": "The Coffin Path by Katherine Clements", "date": "Wednesday 8 August 2018", "text": "The Coffin PathBy Katherine ClementsPublished byHeadline (8 February 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionMaybe you've heard tales about Scarcross Hall, the house on the old coffin path that winds from village to moor top. They say there's something up here, something evil.Mercy Booth isn't afraid. The moors and Scarcross are her home and lifeblood. But, beneath her certainty, small things are beginning to trouble her. Three ancient coins missing from her father's study, the shadowy figure out by the gatepost, an unshakeable sense that someone is watching.When a stranger appears seeking work, Mercy reluctantly takes him in. As their stories entwine, this man will change everything. She just can't see it yet.My verdictI chose to read The Coffin Path as I was looking for a break from all of my usual crime reads. I wanted something to frighten me and surprise me. What a perfect choice! I don't scare easily, but this book certainly left me with an underlying sense of unease and a temptation to check for monsters under the bed. The Coffin Path is a gothic ghost story. It's compelling and chilling, with evocative descriptions that triggered tingles down my spine, goosebumps along my arms and a deep ache in the pit of my stomach. I felt like I was also up there on those bleak moors and at creepy Scarcross Hall, surrounded by darkness and shadowy figures.The book's mix of claustrophobic setting, local superstitions and ghostly apparitions stimulated the dark side of my imagination, with an ending that chilled me to the bone. I admit that I guessed a twist in the tale, but this didn't dampen my enjoyment at all. Brilliant stuff, and I'm now searching for some more creepy ghost stories to read!"},
{"title": "After He's Gone by Jane Isaac", "date": "Monday 6 August 2018", "text": "After He's GoneBy Jane IsaacPublished 18 June 2018I received an Advance Reader Copy from the authorAuthor's descriptionYou think you know him. Until he’s dead.When Cameron Swift is gunned down outside his family home, DC Beth Chamberlain is appointed Family Liaison Officer: a dual role that requires her to support the family, and also investigate them. As the case unfolds and the body count climbs, Beth discovers that nothing is quite as it appears and everyone, it seems, has secrets. Even the dead…My verdictAfter He's Gone is the first in a new series by Jane Isaac, featuring DC Beth Chamberlain. I already love her DI Will Jackman series, so couldn't wait to get stuck into her new book. I certainly wasn't disappointed.The book begins with a bang - literally, as a man is gunned down outside his family home. But what looks like a fairly clearcut case takes Beth Chamberlain on a twisty journey to discover the truth. She's a brilliant new protagonist, with her combination of investigative skills and genuine care for the families she's supporting. It's great to see a crime investigation from a different angle.As expected, as with all Jane Isaac books, the complex plot is authentic and gripping, with lots of twists and turns. Her gorgeous writing is highly compelling and her characters are believable and realistic - in particular, the family's grief as they struggle to cope with tragedy. How well do you know the ones you love - and how do you cope when they're no longer there?I've said this before about Jane Isaac's books, and I'll say it again - she writes fast-paced page turners with plenty of heart and is one of my favourite crime fiction authors. Her books keep you guessing and are filled with secrets and lies.I'm looking forward to following her Beth Chamberlain series."},
{"title": "Member of the Family by Dianne Lake (and Deborah Herman)", "date": "Thursday 2 August 2018", "text": "Member of the Family: Manson, Murder and MeBy Dianne Lake (and Deborah Herman)Published by Harper Element (8 March 2018)Publisher's descriptionFollowing the recent death of Charles Manson – the leader ofthe sinister 60s cult – Dianne Lake reveals the true story of life with Mansonand his ‘family’, who became notorious for a series of shocking murders duringthe summer of 1969.In this poignant and disturbing memoir of lost innocence,coercion, survival, and healing, Dianne Lake chronicles her years with CharlesManson, revealing for the first time how she became the youngest member of hisFamily and offering new insights into one of the twentieth century’s mostnotorious criminals and life as one of his “girls.”At age fourteen, Dianne Lake—with little more than a note inher pocket from her hippie parents granting her permission to leave them—becameone of “Charlie’s girls,” a devoted acolyte of cult leader Charles Manson. Overthe course of two years, the impressionable teenager endured manipulation,psychological control, and physical abuse as the harsh realities and loomingdarkness of Charles Manson’s true nature revealed itself. From Spahn ranch andthe group acid trips, to the Beatles’ White Album and Manson’s dangerousmessiah-complex, Dianne tells the riveting story of the group’s descent intomadness as she lived it.Though she never participated in any of the group’s gruesomecrimes and was purposely insulated from them, Dianne was arrested with the restof the Manson Family, and eventually learned enough to join the prosecution’scase against them. With the help of good Samaritans, including the cop whofirst arrested her and later adopted her, the courageous young woman eventuallyfound redemption and grew up to lead an ordinary life.While much has been written about Charles Manson, thisriveting account from an actual Family member is a chilling portrait thatrecreates in vivid detail one of the most horrifying and fascinating chaptersin modern American history.My verdictIt took me a while to get through Member of the Family. Not because I didn't 'enjoy' it, but because there's a lot packed within its pages, and I felt a need to process everything I was reading by taking a short break every-so-often.The book doesn't explore the gruesome murders by the Manson family. But it does look at the horrific experiences of a young girl, who is neglected by her own family and then taken in by Charles Manson and his cult. Fourteen-year-old Dianne Lake didn't really have a chance at a normal life when her hippy parents introduced her to drugs and then abandoned her to a travelling lifestyle. The book is split into three parts. The first part focuses on Dianne Lake's early family life, the second part focuses on her 'Manson years' and the third part focuses on her recovery.Dianne Lake is honest and open about her experiences, right through to her eventual rescue and recovery. This is a difficult and graphic read in places, covering child abuse (physical, emotional and sexual), drug addiction and brainwashing/control. Photographs in the book of Dianne, her family and several key locations triggered a sense of sadness and despair in me - that parents could abandon their daughter so readily and there was no one there to keep her safe at such a young and impressionable age.Like many people, I have grown up hearing of Charles Manson and his cult. Dianne Lake wasn't involved in his crimes, and doesn't go into huge detail about them, but her story gives an overall insight into the psychological and physical control he had over his cult members."},

She should be excelling in her high-stress job. And she should be completing the demanding to-do lists she makes to keep herself on track. Even if, just sometimes, she doesn't have time to breathe.When Sam's condition worsens and Alex donates a kidney to save his life, her carefully scheduled existence starts to unravel - eventually forcing her to face up to a past that she has buried for years.As the family she has fought so hard for threatens to fall apart, can Alex finally confront the mistakes that have shaped her - and rediscover what is most important in life?My verdictI read a lot of books but none have touched me so much recently as The Rest of Me by Katie Marsh. I was Izzy between the ages of 7 and 12, and again in my adult years, and could easily be Alex now. I won't go into details, as this is a review of the book, not of my life. But this book left me in pieces and in tears, late in the evening one night, unable to sleep, taking me back several decades, bringing back memories that I'd stored away.I love Katie Marsh's writing. I don't read much of this genre, but her books are definite 'must reads' for me. She covers topical emotional issues, writing straight from the heart (and I know that this was a particularly emotional book for Katie Marsh to write). She also covers medical issues with sensitivity and believability. Her writing is so descriptive that it gets right under my skin every time, with characters so real that I wonder if they do truly exist. And she sprinkles all of her books with some gentle humour to lighten the load.It's so easy to give in to the bullies, as well as the self-bullying and the self-doubt. Katie Marsh reminds us that we can be stronger than this, we can rise above it and that we mustn't let the bullies win. Her books are always heartbreaking yet also uplifting and full of hope. They're honest, raw and powerful. And they always make me laugh, cry and think a lot about the important things in life, long after I've turned the final page."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Carolyn Hawes - finalist in the 2018 Ngaio Marsh Awards", "date": "Monday 30 July 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome CAROLYN HAWESfinalist in the 2018 Ngaio Marsh Awards to share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSJoyce Carol Oates creates such a sense of unease in her stories she can convince the reader a crime has been committed whether one actually has or not. Oates doesn’t need to describe the crime because the build-up is usually enough. She became a favorite author of mine years ago when I read her short story about a boy's body found in a ditch. A young girl living nearby becomes almost possessed by the events. When there is no closure and the police have no leads on the killer she becomes frustrated - as I did, and have remained so for the past thirty years such was the power of Joyce’s story.  I enjoy both her novels and short stories. In her collection, Sourland, the title story creates the same psychological effect when a woman makes a solitary journey to an isolated region to visit a man she knows nothing about.Ron Rash is an author I admire because of his poetical writing and the deep damp Appalachians, in which his deeds take place. James L Burke is also a stunning writer with an atmospheric background.Over the past year I have read several crime novels by Tana French, along with Jane Harper's The Dry, and Force of Nature.  Currently I am reading A Killer Harvest by Paul Cleave. I recently read Marlborough Man by David Carter and Baby by Annaleese Jochems. I've also enjoyed the novels of New Zealand crime writers Vanda Symon and Paddy Richardson. ... FILMS/MOVIESI went to the movie To Kill a Mockingbird with my mother and was terrorised by a few of the scenes. (I was only 5 years old at the time.)   I was the same age as Scout. I didn't like her!  I became fixated with the movie and even picked out a house in my hometown similar to the abode of Atticus Finch - right down to the hanging swings on the trees, the nearby reserve, and the wraparound veranda. There was a rustic pioneering look about Maycomb, which I could relate to. I was able to sense something meaningful in the movie without realizing the significance of the trial.  Later, when I read the book; it became one of my favourites.I like the beginning of the movie with the wind blowing through the streets, the unsettling sad staccato music and the wise, somewhat tired narrating voice. I still own the book and I’m proud to say I now have the DVD.... TV DRAMASThe North of England series Vera, and Taggart are among my favorites - or anything from Glasgow, and the moors and rural areas of the North of England, especially if there's a stone barn and a two-rutted driveway. ... MURDER WEAPONChristine, from the movie Christine based on the novel by Stephen King. She was Bad to the Bone. I saw it at the St James Theatre and years later on the TV in my living room. Christine was stylish - I liked the way her radio played 1950s music; I liked her eyelids and the frontal close-ups and the way she flashed her headlights. Christine inflicted a lot of damage but someone had always bashed her up first. I liked her individual antics and her sense of decorum. In one scene the garage door of the workshop folds open and she drives in, looking the worst for wear and with her engine sounding a bit ragged, and puts herself away in her parking space. In spite of the chaotic killing spree she’d just been on, she knew where home was and she stuck to her routine.... WRITING TIPSMy first novel evolved. I would say, don't plan a novel if you can write it intuitively. My second novel is planned from beginning, middle to end. Maybe most novels are a combination of both - although I do think a planned novel is quicker to write.  ... WRITING SNACKSJust an ordinary cup of tea.About CAROLYN HAWESCarolyn Hawes was born and raised in Westport, a small town on the ‘wild West Coast’ of New Zealand’s South Island. She developed a love of writing as soon as she could read and spell enough words to string together into sentences. At 14 she worked on a book of poetry, and tried to write a novel set in Russia and Central Europe. Eventually she gave up writing, decided to ‘get a real job’ and trained to be a nurse. She had three children, remained in Westport and worked on a history book, Great Expectations: the Colonisation of Buller, published in 2004. Following has had freelance articles about the West Coast, history and human-interest columns published in local and big city newspapers. THE FLOATING BASIN is her first novel, a small-town Gothic story centred on a murder inquiry in Westport. Carolyn received a mentorship from the New Zealand Society of Authors while completing the novel. She is now working on a sequel. Find Carolyn Hawes on her Facebook page.About THE FLOATING BASINPublisher's descriptionWhen a body emerges from Westport’s tidal lagoon, local cop Ru Clement is tasked with finding the killer. In a town isolated from any major centres by hundreds of miles of road winding over or around the majestic Southern Alps, there are plenty of secrets. Westport has a rugged history and retains a frontier feel, the kind of place some locals want to escape from, and others escape to. Can Ru untangle why the victim returned to town after so many years, and who wanted him dead? The Floating Basin is a finalist for Best First Novel in the 2018 Ngaio Marsh Awards.Ngaio Marsh Awards judges' comments:“Hawes has planted her first authorial foot firmly, with a very solid debut. She shows a really good touch for the West Coast setting, and has a nice writing style that flows along pretty effortlessly, as well as a good storytelling sense and feel for dialogue.”“I really enjoyed it. I thought Hawes was very good drawing her characters and her use of dialogue was very good and natural. A surprising read.”Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features.Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome JESPER STEINfor his Unrest blog tourto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSMichael Connelly: the Harry Bosch series. From the debut The Black Echo (1992) to Trunk Music(1997). I love everything Connelly writes, his tight, fat-free style, his sense of plot and timing, his characters and way of showing things about them instead of simply telling the readers. The first six novels in the Bosch series is in my humble opinion the best crime writing around, with the most fascinating, understated and subtle antihero in modern crime.... FILMS/MOVIESChinatown. The movie is a homage to the American noir of Hammett and Chandler and everything works: the plot is surprising, the location is LA at its best – for me, the definitive city of modern crime fiction – the actors, Nicholson, Dunnaway and Huston, all playing such convincing characters. And the dialogue is brilliant. Remember the final sentence which sums up the whole movie: “Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.”... TV DRAMASThis is tricky, should I be patriotic and say Broen? The Killing? Or maybe Unit One? They are all very good Danish television crime series that I like, but actually I have to go to Sweden for the series that has inspired me the most: Beck. And although I like Peter Haber as Beck, it is his sidekick who makes it for me: the flamboyant, violent and sensitive bully Gunvald Larsson, played fantastically by Michael Persbrandt. A lot of his behaviour and attitude is in my antihero Axel Steen. Crime in television and books is not essentially carried by the plot but by the depths and complexity of the characters. And Gunvald is one of the best.... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibal Lecter. In Thomas Harris’ two masterpieces Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, Lecter is not really the main fictional killer, but he is a fantastic character even though he is a bit on the fantastical side. “I’m having an old friend for dinner” is one of the funniest and brightest lines that I’ve read. Lecter is probably the most copied fictional character in modern crime, but none of his successors comes close to his level. The only exception is Lars Kepler, who has a serial killer in The Sandman called Jurek Walter and he is really terrifying.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES James Ellroy’s Lloyd Hopkins from the Lloyd Hopkins Trilogy. He is one of the meanest antiheros of American crime fiction. He is an intelligent and manic workaholic, a sex addict, sleepless and plagued by nightmares and doubts; he identifies with the predators he hunts and breaks the law to reach his goals. His marriage is of course chaotic and he fights to keep it, he has three daughters and a rather unhealthy relationship with the youngest, Penny, whom he tells bedtime stories from his hunt of killers in order to make her ready to meet the evils of life. Another quote: “it’s a shitstorm out there, you know that, don’t you, Penguin?”... MURDER WEAPONSI go for the knife. I don’t like murder weapons or methods that are too complicated, so usually kill people in my books in the four ways we do it in Denmark: gun, strangling, blunt object to the head, or knife. The knife is good because it is not an easy kill: you really have to mean it if you push a knife into somebody, especially if you stab them more than once. I have spent ten years as a crime reporter at the biggest Danish national newspaper, and reality always exceeds fiction. So I’ll stick to the knife.    ... DEATH SCENESThe opening scene of the first season of Broen. They put the corpse on the middle of a bridge over Øresund, so half of it is in Denmark, the other in Sweden – it’s a great move and a strong symbol for the whole series.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESWikipedia. The Danish police. Newspaper websites. If I need to research thoroughly I read books or meet people in real life.... WRITING TIPSOne sentence at a time. If you feel you cannot get into a scene or if you suffer from writer’s block because of the immensity of what lies in front of you, break it down to elements like: What is the weather like? What do the surroundings look like? What time is it? How does it smell? Sounds? Noise? What is your point of view? What can your character see? What’s on his/her mind? How is his/her physical condition, feelings? Try to answer these questions in your writing and you’re already on your way.... WRITING SNACKSI drink black tea.

On the streets of Nørrebro, the worst riots Denmark has experienced for many years see violent clashes between the police and far-left autonomists protesting the closure of the Youth House. Meanwhile, in a local cemetery, an unidentified man is found bound and murdered, his body propped up against a gravestone. Detective Superintendent Axel Steen is called to the scene, where all signs suggest the dead man is the victim of police brutality during the riots. But as the investigation progresses, Axel soon discovers that many people, both inside and out of the force, have an unusual interest in the case – and in preventing its resolution.Axel will stop at nothing until he’s uncovered the truth – no matter what. But as he tussles with his ex-wife, his boss, a far-left journalist with a grudge, the security forces and a well-known drug lord, the consequences turn out to be greater than expected... especially for Axel himself. Unrest was published by Mirror Books on 19 July 2018.Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Dead of Night by Michael Stanley", "date": "Sunday 29 July 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be on the blog tour for Dead of Night by Michael Stanley. Michael Stanley is being published in paperback on 31 August 2018, but is available in ebook NOW!Dead of NightBy Michael StanleyPublished by Orenda Books (e-book out now; Paperback - 31 August 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhen freelance journalist, Crystal Nguyen, heads to South Africa, she thinks she’ll be researching an article on rhino-horn smuggling for National Geographic, while searching for her missing colleague. But within a week, she’s been hunting poachers, hunted by their bosses, and then arrested in connection with a murder. And everyone is after a briefcase full of money that may hold the key to everything…Fleeing South Africa, she goes undercover in Vietnam, trying to discover the truth before she’s exposed by the local mafia. Discovering the plot behind the money is only half the battle. Now she must convince the South African authorities to take action before it’s too late. She has a shocking story to tell, if she survives long enough to tell it…My verdictThere's nothing more satisfying than picking up a book, diving in and then coming up for air three hours later. Not ideal though, when it's around 26 degrees outside (and possibly even hotter indoors) and you're too engrossed to move, even though you're gasping for a drink (water, I should add). Dead of Night should come with a health warning - 'so addictive, it could lead to dehydration'.Seriously though, I love Michael Stanley's Sunshine Noir. As many know, I'm a huge fan of the Detective Kubu series, which is also published by Orenda Books. Well, Dead of Night is just as brilliant, possibly even better (though I would struggle to choose between them so I won't, and instead I encourage everyone to read the Kubu series as well).Dead of Night is set in three locations - mainly South Africa but also a little Vietnam and USA. It felt more brutal, graphic and harder hitting than the Detective Kubu series, but with the same amazing writing, vivid descriptions and insight into the African (and also Vietnamese, in this case) culture. While reading the African scenes, I felt like I was on safari, exploring the jungle and watching rhinos, elephants and more in their natural setting.Dead of Night is a fast-paced thriller, filled with action and conflict, focusing on the politics, cultural clashes and violence associated with the rhino trade. I was totally gripped by the feisty and determined female protagonist Crystal Nguyen, an undercover journalist investigating corruption and bribery. I was also touched emotionally by so many of her scenes, just as shocked as she was by the cruelty she witnessed and the violence she experienced.Yet again, as with many of the Orenda Books thrillers, I came away with important environmental messages in my head and having extended my knowledge of world politics, history and culture. I really do hope this is the start of a series as I'm now desperate for more!Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Do No Harm by Lucy V Hay", "date": "Thursday 26 July 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Do No Harm by Lucy V Hay. Do No Harm was published by Orenda Books in paperback on 20 July 2018.Do No HarmBy Lucy V HayPublished by Orenda Books (e-book out now; paperback out 20 July 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionTill death do us part…After leaving her marriage to jealous, possessive oncologist Maxwell, Lily and her six-year-old son have a second chance at happiness with headteacher Sebastian. Kind but vulnerable, Sebastian is the polar opposite of Maxwell, and the perfect match for Lily. After a whirlwind romance, they marry, and that’s when things start to go wrong…Maxwell returns to the scene, determined to win back his family, and events soon spiral out of control. Lily and Sebastian find themselves not only fighting for their relationship, but also their lives…My verdictDo No Harm is a dark tale of obsessive behaviour. One of those psychological thrillers where I couldn't decide whether or not I'd sussed it out until I'd reached the end - and no, I'm not going to reveal whether I did or not. Ha ha.As expected from Orenda's books, Do No Harm is of high quality, from the words on the page to the eye-catching cover. I read a lot of psychological thrillers and often struggle to find ones that grip me all the way through - Do No Harm certainly kept me engrossed from beginning to end. The sharp dialogue, great characterisation and twisty plotting kept the book moving at a fast pace. Lucy V Hay writes with confidence and authority, her vivid descriptions leaping out of the page into my head while her multilayering played with my mind.Do No Harm is filled with several heart-stopping moments and evil characters. The author lulls you in with a false sense of security. But then the tension and suspense escalate, gradually building up to a final crescendo. And as for that ending... what a shocker!This book is going to fly sky high! If you haven't bought it yet, what are you waiting for?Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "The Bone Keeper by Luca Veste", "date": "Wednesday 25 July 2018", "text": "The Bone KeeperBy Luca VestePublished by Simon & Schuster (8 March 2018)I received an Advanced Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhat if the figure that haunted your nightmares as child,the myth of the man in the woods, was real?He'll slice your flesh. Your bones he'll keep.Twenty years ago, fourteenagers went exploring in the local woods, trying to find to the supposedhome of The Bone Keeper. Only three returned. Now, a woman is foundwandering the streets of Liverpool, horrifically injured, claiming to have fledthe Bone Keeper.  Investigating officer DC Louise Henderson must convince sceptical colleagues that thisurban myth might be flesh and blood.  But when a body is unearthed in thewoodland the woman has fled from, the case takes on a much darker tone. The disappeared have been found. And their killer iswatching every move the police make.My verdictIt's been a long time since I read a Luca Veste book (well before my reviewing days) and I really do need to catch up on his Murphy and Rossi series. So I was excited to learn that he had a new standalone - The Bone Keeper. The Bone Keeper is the perfect blend of horror and crime thriller - two genres that I love. It begins with a chilling prologue - four teenagers exploring the woods, with only three of them returning. This then leads into the present day, when a traumatised, injured woman is found wandering the streets of Liverpool. Once DC Louise Henderson takes on the case, exploring several disappearances over the years, the pile of bodies begins to stack up. The Bone Keeper is a local urban myth, but could this mysterious 'being' actually be real or is there a serial killer on the loose?The Bone Keeper is gruesome in some places, creepy in others and overall a fantastic unsettling read. Its unpredictability kept me on my toes, with plenty of surprises in store, and an amazing sense of place leapt from the pages, providing the chilling atmospheric setting. DC Henderson is a mysterious character, and I would love to see more of her in the future, so hope this is the start of a series.This is definitely a book where it's hard to write a review without giving anything away, as the revelations kept on coming. So all I can say is that if you too love a dark, twisty mixture of horror and crime, pick up The Bone Keeper!"},
{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Hannah Sheppard", "date": "Tuesday 24 July 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome HANNAH SHEPPARDLiterary AgentatDHH Literary AgencyWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first job was a six-month placement on a poetry website that Macmillan Children’s Books were launching – it was very varied; from clearing the permissions for the use of the poetry to liaising with teaching experts about lesson plans and on to website testing (which I seem to remember involved endless games of hangman while we tried to get that working). I was very lucky that towards the end of my six months, a permanent Editorial Secretary (which I don’t think is a title that’s used any more – this was back in 2002) job came up and I started working my way up through the editorial ranks. Before that, I’d worked in a bookshop one afternoon a week while I was at university and also did two stints of work experience in publishing – one adult, one children’s.How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve been an agent for five years. And spent 10 years in house before that. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I’ve been lucky enough to work with some incredible authors. At Macmillan, I was Marion Lloyd’s assistant, which meant I got to work with Eva Ibbotson and later I was working with another editor who worked with both Chris Riddell and Frank Cottrell Boyce. When I moved to Headline to run their YA list, I published Tanya Byrne’s HEART-SHAPED BRUISE, which I’m very proud of. As an agent, I work with lots of incredibly talented authors, such as Abi Elphinstone, Keris Stainton, Adam Hamdy and Chris McGeorge – and there are a few names to watch out for – Amy Beashel and Kate Mallinder for instance. Most of my current editorial work is on exciting books that I can’t talk about yet…but I am working on some wonderful debuts at the moment and I can’t wait for other people to start reading! You can find a full list of my current authors here: http://www.dhhliteraryagency.com/hannah-sheppard.htmlWhich qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?Being a reader is the biggest one. You have to read widely to get a good sense of what works and what doesn’t – and what you like and don’t – because so much of being both an agent and an editor is instinct and gut feeling. And you have to trust your instincts and not second guess because other people don’t feel the same. Maybe also single-mindedness. I knew this was what I wanted to do so I didn’t listen to the careers advisors who sucked in their breath and told me publishing was very difficult to get into and maybe I should think about teaching (because that really isthe only option open to English graduates). That same single-mindedness and unshaking belief in something helps when you’re trying to sell a book too. How do you relax after a busy working day?There’s a lot of work reading that goes on in the evenings and at weekends (my submission inbox and any manuscripts I’ve called in are mostly tackled outside of office hours). But I like to try to have a just for fun book on the go too. And I’m really enjoying binging TV series that have a really good story at their heart – recent favourites include This Is Us from the US and Unforgotten from ITV (I’m very excited that new series of both are imminent!). I also love the theatre – It’s definitely all about story. I’m trying to do more knitting so that my hands are busy with something other than my phone. When I’m working from home I try to go for a lunchtime swim to break up the day and as much as I hated exercise as a kid I now realise it’s very important for my mental health. What was the last book you read for pleasure?I read Home by Amanda Berriman and I thought it was a brilliant example of voice done well – it also managed to make me feel physically anxious at times. My TBR pile is humungous. There are books everywhere. Including in my bed. Describe your job in 15 words or less...Oooh, my favourite description was given to me by an author, Natalie Flynn…I re-habilitate my client’s wayward imaginary friends before finding them forever homes.What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farThere are too many to choose from really…I love this industry – it’s full of supportive and talented people who are passionate about what they do and working with them is a real highlight. And each and every one of my authors’ successes is a joy – I love to champion them and celebrate each victory (big or small). I do remember the first time I walked out of Macmillan Children’s Books with a manuscript in my canvas bag (pre-eReaders, I always had both a handbag and a canvas bag full of manuscripts – I don’t miss that) having just started as an editorial secretary. It was one of those clear, crisp nights in the run up to Christmas when all the lights are starting to go on and everything looks pretty and I couldn’t have been happier to have that manuscript to read. It felt like such a moment of achievement…there have been bigger achievements since (a Waterstones Book of the Month with Abi Elphinstone’s SKY SONG earlier this year for instance was a real joy), but that is one where the feeling has really stuck with me.   If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I’d love to be a pilot. Early on in my career I considered quitting publishing to go and retrain…but even with the backing of a commercial airline it’s horrifically expensive. I love the idea of having that freedom though. One day, when I’m super rich (cough), I’ll get my pilot’s licence. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Thank You For Your Patience… I feel like I’m saying this all the time – to clients waiting for edits and to authors who have submitted. An agent’s job is a busy one and there’s never enough time to fit everything in. It’s also fitting for publishing in general, which often feels incredibly slow…the whole process of getting a book out can take far longer than anyone outside of the industry realises. Thanks so much for taking part, Hannah!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},

MURDER WEAPONSI’m fascinated by mind control – when people manage to manipulate others and use them as weapons. Like the Charles Manson case.     ...

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Jo Jakeman", "date": "Thursday 12 July 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome JO JAKEMANto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSThere are so many hugely talented crime writers on the shelves at the moment, but I’ll have to pick the writer of the first crime books I read that blew my mind, and that would be Thomas Harris. I could pretty much answer all of the questions below with one of his books or characters.... FILMS/MOVIESSee? What did I tell you? Thomas Harris all day long. It has to be Silence of the Lambs. It was a genius film of a genius book. Incredibly well acted and plotted, and it’s so quotable. Fava beans, anyone?... TV DRAMASPeaky Blinders. I love a British Crime drama. It’s not just the stories or the characterisation of Peaky Blinders, it’s the way it is filmed, and the music that they use. I particularly love that we’re behind the ‘bad guys’ all the way. I get excited as soon as I hear the theme music.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSAnnie Wilkes in Stephen King’s Misery. It’s a wonder I ever wanted to become a writer after reading about characters like her. Not only does she lock up an author for killing off her favourite character, Misery, but it seems that murder is the way she has dealt with all of her problems. In the film she breaks Sheldon’s ankle with a sledgehammer. It’s an iconic film moment, but in the book she chops his foot off with an axe and cauterises it with a blow torch. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Sherlock Holmes. I love the wit, and the eccentricity. And there’s something about the fact that he doesn’t quite fit in to the world around him that appeals to me. ... MURDER WEAPONSI remember watching Tales of the Unexpected as a child and there was an episode which was adapted from a Roald Dhal story about a woman who kills her with a frozen leg of lamb and then cooks and serves it to the policemen who come to investigate the crime, niftily getting rid of the evidence.    ... DEATH SCENESAt the risk of sounding predictable here, it’s another example from Silence of the Lambs. When Lecter manipulates Miggs into killing himself after he ‘disrespected’ Clarice, there’s no blood shed. Lecter couldn’t even touch him and yet he was still able to orchestrate Miggs’ death using nothing but his mind.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI don’t really use any blogs or websites for research unless it is something particular such as, ‘how quickly can you bleed to death’… I can waste an entire day on the internet so I’m not to be trusted with the Wifi code.... WRITING TIPSWrite every day if you can. As with most things, writing gets better with practice. If you’re waiting for inspiration to strike you might be waiting a long time. It’s unlikley the words you’re putting on the page are your best work, but you can edit them later. You can’t edit a blank page.... WRITING SNACKSCoffee and chocolate. Sticks and Stones was largely fuelled by Lindt Dark Caramel and Sea Salt. Which reminds me, I’ve still got a bar in the cupboard and book two isn’t going to write itself…About JO JAKEMANJo Wakeman was the winner of the Friday Night Live 2016 competition at the York Festival of Writing.

AUTHORSRoss Macdonald. I discovered his novels at the age of 15 while perusing the twirling metal paperback rack at our local grocery store. This was usually where I found the latest Rex Stout/Nero Wolfe novel, or an Agatha Christie reprint. I picked up  Macdonald’s The Goodbye Look, by Ross Macdonald, because of the blurb at the top from William Goldman: “The finest series of detective novels ever written by an American.” That was good enough for me. Macdonald was the author who showed me the potential of the detective novel, how you could take the conventions of a mystery and use them to make a statement. ... FILMS/MOVIESMy two favourite films just also happen to be Alfred Hitchcock’s two finest works: Rear Window and Vertigo. I go back and forth on which is number one and which is number two. They’re both brilliant, and for me, influential. The last five minutes of Vertigo are the best last five minutes of any movie ever made.... TV DRAMASWow, so many to choose from. Whatever the last series I binge-watched is usually the one I think is the best I’ve ever seen. But there are standouts. Happy Valley, The Night Manager, Ozark, Homeland, The Americans. What do they all have in common? Intriguing characters. Plot is important, but character is always the grabber.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThe Joker, especially as portrayed by Heath Ledger. No one else even comes close in terms of pure evil. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Columbo, hands down. The raincoat, the cigar, the “Oh, just one more question.” Best TV detective ever. In novels, Lew Archer, the private eye created by Ross Macdonald. He’s not quirky. There are no gimmicks. He asks questions, pursues leads, driven by an underlying sense of justice and a belief that exposing buried secrets to sunlight has a purifying effect. ... MURDER WEAPONSSpeaking of Hitchcock, wasn’t there an episode of his old TV show where a woman killed her husband with a frozen cut of beef, then cooked it up and served it to the investigating officers? The cops ATE the murder weapon. Beat that. ... DEATH SCENESWhen the truck goes over the cliff at the end of Steven Spielberg’s Duel.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESHas there ever been a day when I did not go on IMDB, the Internet Movie Database? Every evening when we sit down to watch TV, we see something that prompts any number of the following questions: “What did we see her in before?” “Where do I know him from?” “What was that other movie with, you know, the guy? The one with the hair?” “Is this the season finale, or is there one more?” “Which episode was it where Diane first meets Frasier?” “Is the music for this movie done by the same guy who did the music for that other movie, because it sure sounds similar?” There’s nothing IMDB does not know.... WRITING TIPSRead. Also, read. And finally, read. Anyone who thinks they can write a novel without having read A LOT probably thinks someone can perform open heart surgery without having gone to medical school. If you’ve passed that hurdle, then write. Also, write. And finally, write. Be writing, even if the only person who is going to read this work is yourself. I’d written three or four novels by the time I was 25. My first was published when I was 49. Persist. ...

{"title": "MY WRITING DAY with Jane Isaac", "date": "Monday 9 July 2018", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Jane Isaac to Off-the-Shelf Books today, to talk about her writing day! After He's Gone was published on 20 June 2018.My Writing DayBy Jane IsaacIt’s six years since my first book was released (and eight since I first started penning novels) and my writing routine and lifestyle has seen many changes. In the early days, I wrote when the mood took me, fitted the words around my day job, my trusted computer balanced precariously on my lap, wherever I perched myself. I know some writers manage this juggling match brilliantly, but it’s always been a challenge for me and I found I was sacrificing more and more family time with every book. My daughter was getting older and kept reminding me she’d be off to university soon. I needed to make some changes, to spend more time with her. So, last year, I handed in my notice at the day job and made the decision to write full time, at least for a while.My husband embraced my decision wholeheartedly and moved his guitars (well, most of them!) out of the spare room. A desk was installed, followed by a noticeboard, a computer and a chair. There’s plenty of colour in my new office. I’m the Queen of Post-it pads and have a kaleidoscope of notes attached to my whiteboard. The room doesn’t have much of a view, although I am accompanied by a bookshelf, the smallest in the house so I've filled it with my comfort books; those I can whip down and read when I'm looking for motivation. When I finished the day job, I imagined dropping my daughter at school in the morning and driving back through the country lanes while pondering plot points and character traits. In reality, I listen to the morning news while dashing back to walk the dog and complete my chores. It’s almost 9.30am by the time the dog and I traipse up to my office to begin work.I’m prone to procrastination and find I can easily while away a couple of hours reading posts on Facebook or chatting on Twitter, so I have to be disciplined. I don't check emails or social media until I’ve made some progress on the scene I’m currently working on. I’ll work until 3pm when I have to do the school run and walk the dog. If it’s been a good day, I’ll be completely absorbed and forget lunch. If it hasn’t, I’ll have shifted about, snacked constantly, and dipped in and out of social media. Often I’ll be back at my keyboard in the evening, catching up with admin, or penning some more words. Occasionally I’ll have an event or a talk to prepare for.My new title, After He’s Gone, marks the first in the DC Beth Chamberlain series. Beth is a Family Liaison Officer which offers an intriguing new angle on a murder investigation, for me. Liaison officers spend a lot of time with the family, updating them on the investigation and feeding back information and often get very close. And since most people are killed by someone they know or someone close to them, it affords the opportunity to unravel some really intriguing secrets! I’ve just finished the first draft of the second in the series, which is scheduled for release later this year, and am now working on an outline for a third. I find I plan more with every book; the whiteboard on the wall of my office is currently filled with drawings, photos, mind maps and notes for my new project.Sometimes there’s a hiccup in my script, a moment's blindness. It happens. It's always happened. The only way I can cope with it is to remove myself and do something different like research a plot point, or a new scene. It’s lovely to go out and visit potential settings, meet with people for coffee, or read up for background. I probably do far too much of it, only a trickle will find its way into the novel, but I think it convinces my brain I’m still being productive when the words don’t flow!About Jane IsaacJane Isaac lives with her detective husband (very helpful for research!) and her daughter in rural Northamptonshire, UK where she can often be found trudging over the fields with her Labrador, Bollo. Her debut, An Unfamiliar Murder, was nominated as best mystery in the 'eFestival of Words Best of the Independent eBook awards 2013.' The follow up, The Truth Will Out, was nominated as ‘Thriller of the Month – April 2014’ by E-Thriller.com.After He’s Gone is Jane’s sixth novel and the first in a new series featuring Family Liaison Officer, DC Beth Chamberlain.

He stays up late, calling strangers from his phonebook, hoping to make a connection, while his wife, Maeve, sleeps upstairs. A crossed wire finds a suicidal Hadley Serf on the phone to Seth, thinking she is talking to The Samaritans.But a seemingly harmless, late-night hobby turns into something more for Seth and for Hadley, and soon their late-night talks are turning into day-time meet-ups. And then this dysfunctional love story turns into something altogether darker, when Seth brings Hadley home…And someone is watching…My verdictOn the day Good Samaritans arrived in the post, I thought I'd just 'check it out'.So I read the first page...        Then I read the first chapter...                 Then I read the whole book...                            And then, that evening, I tweeted this:I loved Michael Grothaus' Epiphany Jones, also published by Orenda Books. On the surface (or if you read the blurb), Good Samaritans is nothing like it - the stories are very different, the subject matter too. But inside, I found the same quirkiness, darkness and humour, again packaged neatly in a brilliantly written, additive read.Short chapters switch seamlessly between the lead characters, which prompted me to read 'just one more'. I should have hated so many characters but I loved them all instead. These are ordinary people doing extraordinary things behind closed doors. Good Samaritans? Definitely... but only on their own terms. Who knew insomnia could be so dangerous?Good Samaritans is sexy, dark, explicit and graphic in places, so certainly not for the fainthearted. It's twisty and twisted too. Is this love story? Oh yes, but not necessarily in the way you think. It's certainly a tale of lust, obsession, control and desperation.The book kept me guessing and certainly kept me engrossed, with many 'laugh out loud' moments and pages read with a gasp. It's an incredibly hard book to review without giving anything away - and I really do hope that other reviewers are equally as careful. This is a book that needs to be read 'blind', just using the blurb on the jacket as your guide.To sum it up - I loved this book and will happily shout about it from the rooftops! In fact, I'm sure I will over the coming months (and beyond). And I'll never look at bottles of bleach in quite the same way again."},
{"title": "Authors' Creative Pursuits - Louise Mangos", "date": "Friday 6 July 2018", "text": "Authors are a very creative bunch - and for many of them, this isn’t only with words on the page. From drawing to painting, pottery to needlework, composing to singing, here’s a look at some authors’ creative pursuits.I am delighted to welcome LOUISE MANGOSAUTHOR OF STRANGERS ON A BRIDGE, PUBLISHED BY HQ DIGITAL ON 6 JULY 2018TO TALK ABOUT HER LOVE OF PAINTINGHave you always been creative – and not just with words? Before I could write, my creativity involved sketching ponies at the kitchen table from morning until night. I loved to draw with coloured pencils. Since I could spell my name I’ve always wanted to write. My first successfully published endeavour was a poem about my mum for mother’s day when I was eleven years old. It won a school competition and was published in our local paper. Have you always enjoyed painting or is this a more recent hobby of yours? If it's a more recent hobby, did you start it for any particular reason?I was introduced to acrylic paints in my mid-twenties. Then there was no looking back. I tried oil paints for a while, but was put off by the lengthy drying time between the stages of ‘layering’ my work and the smell of turpentine around the house. Since my free time is taken up with fewer sporting activities now that I’m getting older, I spend more time writing and painting.How often do you paint and how easy is it to find the time?I have a fixed time that I paint with a mentor once a week for a three-hour session. Otherwise I fit my painting at home around my writing. If I didn’t have the obligation of painting with my mentor I probably wouldn’t have the motivation to do it regularly. I can, on the other hand, always find time to write ;o)Do you do any other arts and crafts?I’ve always been crafty. I loved to make gifts for my family from Blue Peter ideas when I was a child. I also enjoyed sewing for a few years, and made some money designing fun fleece hats for kids. I make my own Christmas and birthday cards, have done some decoupage and love photography. I often walk with a camera to capture images for my next painting project. I worked in our local Swiss school in a volunteer capacity for a few years, mainly to teach the kids extra English, and ended up using crafting projects to make the learning more exciting.Do you think painting (or the time you spend painting) helps with your writing and overall wellbeing?  Painting and writing fiction go hand in hand. They both involve creating images, the first with colour and the second with words. Voltaire said ‘Writing is the painting of the voice.’Do you enjoy painting anything in particular?My favourite subjects are landscapes, particularly those with mountains, clouds and water. I feel so blessed living in Switzerland where these three elements are in daily abundance.What have you been painting recently?I’ve recently finished a painting of autumn leaves on one of the cobbled-stone streets in our village. You can see the progress of the work through the three images.   THANKS FOR TAKING PART, LOUISE!About LOUISE MANGOSLouise writes novels, short stories and flash fiction, which have won prizes, placed on shortlists, and been read out on BBC radio.

{"title": "Attend by West Camel - an Orenda Books cover reveal!!", "date": "Thursday 5 July 2018", "text": "Today, I'm delighted and excited to be hosting a cover reveal for Orenda Books. Before I tell you about the book, I should tell you who the author is. But even that's a bit of a surprise, as the author originally popped his book into the submissions file under a different name. Sneaky, huh? (I've been meaning to ask him which name he used).So, that MAY give you a clue about who the author is. If not, here's another clue. He's already a well-known, established and essential member of Team Orenda. Worked it out yet?Time for a drum roll...And now back to the cover reveal... I am delighted to reveal the cover for Attend by Orenda Books editor West Camel. Not only is he a brilliant editor, but I have been told (on good authority - i.e. by Karen Sullivan herself) that he is a fantastic writer too. Attend is being published by Orenda Books in December 2018.As we all know, Karen Sullivan is very picky when choosing her authors (and books), which why the Orenda books are of such high quality, so I'm sure that Attend is going to be amazing. I can't wait to read West's book to discover his writing for myself!!!Attend: Read the blurbWhen Sam falls in love with Deptford thug Derek, and Anne’s best friend Kathleen takes her own life, they discover they are linked not just by a world of drugs and revenge; they also share the friendship of the uncanny and enigmatic Deborah.Seamstress, sailor, story-teller and self-proclaimed centenarian immortal, Deborah slowly reveals to Anne and Sam her improbable, fantastical life, a history of hidden Deptford and ultimately the solution to their crises.With echoes of Armistead Maupin, Attend is a beautifully written, darkly funny, mesmerisingly emotive and deliciously told debut novel, rich in finely wrought characters that you will never forget.I am SO intrigued and hope you are too!!! AND NOW.... *drum roll*Attend: View the coverI love this cover! And I'm desperate to read the book to discover the significance of the needle and thread.Attend: Read about author West CamelBorn and bred in south London – and not the Somerset village with which he shares a name – West Camel worked as an editor in higher education and business before turning his attention to the arts and publishing.  He has worked as a book and arts journalist, and was editor at Dalkey Archive Press, where he edited the Best European Fiction 2015 anthology, before moving to new press Orenda Books just after its launch.  He currently combines his work as editor at Orenda with writing and editing a wide range of material for various arts organisations, including ghost-writing a New-Adult novel and editing The Riveter magazine for the European Literature Network.

Cold Desert Sky is being published by Faber & Faber on 5th July 2018.Cold Desert SkyBy Rod ReynoldsPublished by Faber & Faber (5 July 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.  Publisher's descriptionNo one wanted to say it to me, that the girls were dead. But I knew.Late 1946 and Charlie Yates and his wife Lizzie have returned to Los Angeles, trying to stay anonymous in the city of angels. But when Yates, back in his old job at the Pacific Journal, becomes obsessed by the disappearance of two aspiring Hollywood starlets, Nancy Hill and Julie Desjardins, he finds it leads him right back to his worst fear: legendary Mob boss Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel, a man he once crossed, and whose shadow he can't shake.As events move from LA to the burgeoning Palace of Sin in the desert, Las Vegas - where Siegel is preparing to open his new Hotel Casino, The Flamingo - Rod Reynolds once again shows his skill at evoking time and place. With Charlie caught between the FBI and the mob, can he possibly see who is playing who, and find out what really happened to the two girls?My verdictI can't believe that it's nearly two years since I last spent time in the company of Charlie Yates and his wife Lizzie. But I've just checked and it is! A few pages into Cold Desert Sky and I don't feel like I've been away from them at all. I also realise how much I've missed them.Rod Reynolds is a master at creating authentic crime fiction steeped in American noir. His books are set not only in the US, but also in the 1940s. So it's no mean feat to make them feel very real, and he certainly does just that. His descriptions are evocative and atmospheric, his dialogue sharp and spot on.Charlie Yates is an experienced journalist trying to find two women who have disappeared in the glamorous, glitzy world of Hollywood. He certainly isn't a pushover and isn't afraid to take risks, but he also has plenty of heart. Lizzie is far more than Charlie's wife, or 'sidekick' - she's an equal partner, feisty and opinionated, and his voice of reason. They have a loving relationship, independent when they're apart but also reliant on one another when they're together.Cold Desert Sky takes us on a rollercoaster journey as Charlie and Lizzie go in search of the truth, looking for these two young women. They've managed to put their lives in danger and it's going to take a lot for them to wriggle their way out of it, with a mobster on their trail. But who can they trust along the way? Paranoia seeps through the pages, and the stakes are high.Yet again, Rod Reynolds has written a fast-paced read. And with that ending, I hope there will be more Charlie Yates to come.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Claymore Straker's Journey - The Abrupt Physics of Dying", "date": "Tuesday 3 July 2018", "text": "Claymore Straker is the main character in Paul Hardisty's Straker series, which is published by Orenda Books. These are action-packed, and also thought-provoking, environmental thrillers. With each book, I have followed Straker's emotional & ripping rollercoaster journey, and I have learnt so much about environmental issues and political climates around the world too.There are four books in the Straker series so far - An Abrupt Physics of Dying, The Evolution of Fear, Reconciliation for the Dead and, recently published on 30 May 2018, Absolution. I am a huge fan of these books and recommend them highly!!Today, Paul Hardisty talks about Claymore Straker's Journey through his first book, The Abrupt Physics of Dying.Here's a little about the book first:Claymore Straker is trying to forget a violent past. Working as an oil company engineer in the wilds of Yemen, he is hijacked at gunpoint by Islamic terrorists. Clay has a choice: help uncover the cause of a mysterious sickness afflicting the village of Al Urush, close to the company's oil-processing facility, or watch Abdulkader, his driver and close friend, die.As the country descends into civil war and village children start dying, Clay finds himself caught up in a ruthless struggle between opposing armies, controllers of the country's oil wealth, Yemen's shadowy secret service, and rival terrorist factions.As Clay scrambles to keep his friend alive, he meets Rania, a troubled journalist. Together, they try to uncover the truth about Al Urush. But nothing in this ancient, unforgiving place is what it seems. Accused of a murder he did not commit, put on the CIA's most-wanted list, Clay must come to terms with his past and confront the powerful forces that want him dead.Gritty, gripping and shocking, The Abrupt Physics of Dying will not only open your eyes, but keep them glued to the page until the final, stunning denouement is reached.And now over to Paul:\"The first book of the series, The Abrupt Physics of Dying, is set in Yemen in 1994 as the civil war erupts. I was there at the time, and wanted to write something that would capture the time, the sheer chaos and terror of the place, and the really bad stuff I saw. I was working on it for ten years, on and off, but it wasn’t until I got to Australia that it really came together. Clay is in Yemen working as an engineer with the burgeoning oil industry, in the loneliest place he can find, trying to escape his brutal past - trying to escape himself.  There he meets Rania, a beguiling, troubled journalist who is researching the Islamic uprising in the country. She is Muslim, he atheist, a scarred veteran of South Africa’s war in Angola, haunted by the memories of what he saw and did. As Yemen descends into chaos, and kids start dying in the villages close to the oil company’s operations, the pair are thrown together in a search for the truth. Their journey begins.\"The Abrupt Physics of Dying was one of the first books I reviewed on Off-the-Shelf Books. You can find my review here.  About Paul HardistyRead about Paul Hardisty's life experiences and qualifications, and you'll understand why he writes his Straker books!Canadian by birth, Paul Hardisty has spent 25 years working all over the world as an engineer, hydrologist and environmental scientist. He has roughnecked on oil rigs in Texas, explored for gold in the Arctic, mapped geology in Eastern Turkey (where he was befriended by PKK revels) and rehabilitated water wells in the wilds of Africa. He was in Ethiopia in 1991 as the Mengistu regime fell, and was bumped from one of the last flights out of Addis Ababa by bureaucrats and their families fleeing the rebels. In 1993 he survived a bomb blast in a café in Sana’a, and was one of the last Westerners out of Yemen before the outbreak of the 1994 civil war. Paul is a university professor and Director of Australia’s national land, water ecosystems and climate adaptation research programmes.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Ruth Ware", "date": "Monday 2 July 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome RUTH WAREfor her The Death of Mrs Westaway blog tourto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSIt's too hard to pick just one overall, so I am going to cheat a little and pick an author that had a huge influence of The Death of Mrs W - which has to be Daphne du Maurier. She is wonderful at setting, but most of all, I think she is an expert at taking you inside the mind of her protagonist, immersing you into their fears and hopes and suspicions in a way that I aspire to do.... FILMS/MOVIESOooh... tough one... I'm torn between ‪Dial M For Murder, which I just adore, and Gaslight. Both are wonderful studies in female paranoia-or-is-it - that growing sense that something is wrong, when everyone is telling you it's not. Gaslight deserves to be far better known, though it has given us the psychological abuse term \"gaslighting\" - to persuade something that they are suffering from paranoia and imagining things when really they are in the right. ... TV DRAMASI'm a sucker for Murder She Wrote. What can I say - I just love everything about it. Jessica Fletcher is who Nancy Drew aspires to be when she grows up.... FICTIONAL KILLERSI have a soft spot for the killers in Nine Tailors by Dorothy L Sayers - I can't say anything more without spoiling the plot, but it's so ingeniously done.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES It has to be Miss Marple. Jessica Fletcher aside, there are simply not enough kick-ass old ladies in fiction, and Miss Marple is doing her best to redress the scale.... MURDER WEAPONSMmm.... it's probably the frozen leg of lamb in Roald Dahl's Lamb to the Slaughter. Partly because it's so ingenious, and partly because my own grandmother almost (unintentionally) did for my father in the same way, when she bopped him playfully on the head with the Sunday joint, not realising it was still frozen.    ... DEATH SCENESI think it has to be the scene in ‪Pulp Fiction where Vincent (John Travolta) shoots Marvin (Phil LaMarr) in the face by accident in the middle of a conversation. It's so brilliantly shocking and yet banal the first time you see it - I watched the film in the cinema and I remember the horrified screech from the audience followed by the nervous disbelieving laughter as the situation sunk in. In a film (and industry) in which violence is fetishised and feted and choreographed, it's a clever reminder that in real life it's often just dumb and random.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI actually don't follow a whole lot of crime blogs and websites because that doesn't tend to be the aspect of my books that I spend most time researching. For example for The Death of Mrs Westaway, the thing I spent most time researching was actually tarot, which features quite heavily in the plot. In my books the crime itself is often comparatively unimportant in a weird way - it happens off screen or in the past, so my focus isn't on that, it's more on character and how people interact, which you can research anywhere from Reddit to Facebook to just plain old real life. However I did love the podcast Serial, in spite of having some moral reservations about the effect on real life people of how it was played out.... WRITING TIPSJust crack on and do it, is my advice. You can find endless excuses to procrastinate - waiting for the perfect tranch of clear time, or the perfect plot, or the perfect computer or writing course. None of that really matters. If the story is good enough, the rest doesn't matter, and if it's not, then none of those factors will plaster over the cracks. ... WRITING SNACKSAnything with cheese in / on / around. Mmmm....About RUTH WARERuth Ware is an international number one bestseller.

She owes money to a loan shark and the threats are getting increasingly aggressive: she needs to get her hands on some cash fast. There's just one problem - Hal's real grandparents died more than twenty years ago. The letter has been sent to the wrong person. But Hal knows that the cold-reading techniques she’s honed as a seaside fortune teller could help her con her way to getting the money. If anyone has the skills to turn up at a stranger's funeral and claim a bequest they’re not entitled to, it’s her. Hal makes a choice that will change her life for ever.

{"title": "Overkill by Vanda Symons", "date": "Saturday 30 June 2018", "text": "OverkillBy Vanda SymonPublished by Orenda Books (Ebook - out now; Paperback - 6 September 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhen the body of a young mother is found washed up on the banks of the Mataura River, a small rural community is rocked by her tragic suicide. But all is not what it seems. Sam Shephard, sole-charge police constable in Mataura, soon discovers the death was no suicide and has to face the realisation that there is a killer in town. To complicate the situation, the murdered woman was the wife of her former lover. When Sam finds herself on the list of suspects and suspended from duty, she must cast said her personal feelings and take matters into her own hands. To find the murderer... and clear her name. A taut, atmospheric and pageturning thriller, Overkill marks the start of an unputdownable and unforgettable series from one of New Zealand s finest crime writers.My verdictI predict that Overkill is another winning book for publisher Orenda. I loved this crime thriller from the moment I started reading the chilling prologue, through every spellbinding chapter and right through to the shocking ending.Set in a small town in New Zealand, this book features police constable Sam Shepherd, a feisty, risk-taking protagonist with a wicked sense of humour (prompting actual laughs as I read). When Sam investigates the suicide of a young mother, Gaby, she soon realises this was, in fact, murder, which means there's a killer on the loose. To complicate matters, Gaby happened to be married to Sam's former lover. When her bosses discover the link, Sam's not only taken off the case, but treated as a suspect. Though nothing will stop Sam from conducting her own investigation on the quiet, to discover the truth about what happened to Gaby in her final moments.Sam wears her heart on her sleeve, and her friendship (and conversations) with flatmate Maggie really brought her to life. I loved being inside her head. She's tough but also vulnerable and possibly a little naive. She felt like more than just a character in a book - someone very real - and I found myself warming to her immediately.Overkill features short, snappy chapters, which move the plot forwards at a fast pace, with great literary writing. Tension and emotion spill out of every page, and I found myself whizzing through from beginning to end. I genuinely couldn't stop reading, addicted not only to the gripping twisty plot but also to its great sense of place and range of believable characters - a perfect combination.I don't rave about many books, but this one prompted a few raving tweets and is certainly one that I'll be recommending widely. The Sam Shepherd series isn't new - the books have been around for a decade in New Zealand but have slipped under the radar, until now. This is the first to be published by Orenda Books, and it has been 'lovingly and beautifully rewritten'. Now I'm desperately waiting for the next one! And I can't wait for other people to discover Overkill's brilliance too."},

The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome LAURA PEARSONAUTHOR OF MISSING PIECESTO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITFOR HER BLOG TOURMissing Pieces was published on 21 June 2018 by Agora Books. Armchair and footstoolI have an enormous armchair and footstool in my living room and I usually write sitting there. Sometimes I start out at the dining table in the morning, but I almost always end up back in my armchair at some point. I’m not sure why. I suppose I’m just comfortable there.LaptopI write on my laptop, using Word. I’ve had a few laptops over the years; my current one is a HP. I’m not fussy. It just has to be reasonably fast and straightforward. My husband takes care of anything technical – if I get a new phone or laptop, he always sets it up for me, and he deals with any issues I have. I know that if I only have my work in progress open, I’ll get a lot more done, but despite that, I often open up Twitter and Facebook and my emails and Netgalley and Amazon, and then I flounder.BooksI like to have books around me wherever I am. We have bookcases in almost every room of the house. I don’t often refer to a specific book when I’m writing, but it’s important to me that they’re close by. I’m always reading at least two books (usually one is an audiobook), no matter what stage of writing or editing I’m at.SnacksI’m a terrible snacker. I’m obsessed with chocolate. I’ve always had a sweet tooth but it was out of control in both my pregnancies and has never really gone back to normal. If I get stuck on something I’m writing, or the words aren’t flowing well, the first thing I do is usually head to the kitchen cupboards. I don’t think I would ever tire of eating cappuccino chocolate bars from Thorntons or Marks and Spencer. Or Cadbury’s Dairy Milk, for that matter.Writing buddiesI have some really good writing friends. I met two of them, Lia Louis and Rebecca Williams, on Twitter, and we’re all mums to young children and writers, and we have a What’s App group where we talk daily about our successes and failures, our frustrations and our excitements. It helps so much. I’m forever sending them bits of drafts or asking for their advice about stuff. Lia has a novel coming out next year and Rebecca is working on a novel that’s really fresh and original, and I feel really lucky to have them in my pocket (as it were). Another one, Rachael Smart, sort of fell into my life about a year ago and I’ll always be grateful that she did. She’s clever and funny and kind, and reading her words is a bit like stepping out into thick, untouched snow.SilenceI’ve never tried writing with music on, but I know that if the TV’s on, I get really distracted. Sometimes I try to do a bit of writing while my daughter is napping and my son is watching cartoons, but it never works. When I’m at home alone, I write in complete silence, and that seems to work for me. Writing mentorI’ve had a writing mentor, Gillian McAllister, since last summer. She was supposed to give me two hours of mentoring, and here we are, a year later. Because I signed my deal with Agora quite soon after we met, the mentoring hasn’t so much been about her critiquing my writing (although there’s been some of that) but more about her answering my never-ending questions about the publishing process. She’s very patient, really insightful and a wonderful writer. THANKS FOR TAKING PART, LAURA!About Laura PearsonLaura Pearson has an MA in Creative Writing from the University of Chichester.

{"title": "Dark Waters by Mary-Jane Riley", "date": "Tuesday 26 June 2018", "text": "Dark WaterBy Mary-Jane RileyPublished by Killer Reads (16 March 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionSecrets lie beneath the surface…Two men, seemingly unconnected, are discovered dead in aholiday boat on the Norfolk Broads, having apparently committed suicidetogether.Local journalist Alex Devlin, planning an article on thedangers of internet suicide forums, starts digging into their backgrounds.But Alex’s investigation soon leads her to a much darkermystery – one that will hit closer to home than she could possibly haveimagined, and place the lives of those she loves in terrible danger.My verdictI really enjoy Mary-Jane Riley's writing. All three of her Alex Devlin books have been very easy to read, with plenty of description to paint a vivid picture in my head of characters and places without taking anything away from the pace of the plot.Alex Devlin is a fantastic character - a feisty journalist with a nose for mystery who throws herself into her job 100% but still manages to maintain a strong sense of family. There are some larger-than-life flamboyant characters in Dark Waters too, providing some light-hearted humorous moments. There's one particular character I would have loved to see more of (since he features more heavily in the previous books) but he's still there in the background.I highly recommend Dark Waters. I found myself racing through the pages and had to remind myself to breathe! A couple of twists and turns made me sit upright as I really didn't see those coming. This series is getting better and better, and the main characters are definitely growing with each book. As with the previous books, Dark Waters left me wanting more (in a good way).Can this be read as a standalone? Yes, it probably can. But I would suggest you buy (and read) all three books in this series so far anyway!"},

The Cliff House is yet another stunning read - a superb psychological thriller that will stay with you afterwards.This is a story of parental love and families, mother-daughter relationships, jealousy, grief and possession. It looks at the devastating aftermath of tragedy, and how easily our experiences and memories can be distorted by our own thoughts and also by the people around us. This book is very much about ownership, of places as well as people, and a reminder that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.The Cliff House is chilling from the start, with a sense of impending doom. I could guess how it was going to end - but had no idea who, what, how or why. This book reminded me not to believe everything that's on the page, and that you often have to read between the lines, as well as the words themselves, to really get to the heart of what's going on.Amanda Jennings' gorgeous, vivid descriptions made me believe I was there in Cornwall, swimming in that pool overlooking the sea. While the book is very much character-led, its title 'The Cliff House' is also very apt, as the house has a significant influence on the lives (and interactions) of all of the main characters. I didn't actually realise how much the characters had touched me until I noticed tears in my eyes at the end."},
{"title": "The Lion Tamer Who Lost by Louise Beech", "date": "Wednesday 20 June 2018", "text": "The Lion Tamer Who LostBy Louise BeechPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 15 July 2018; Paperback - 30 September 2018) I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher Publisher's descriptionBe careful what you wish for…Long ago, Andrew made a childhood wish, and keptit in a silver box. When it finally comes true, he wishes it hadn’t…Long ago, Ben made a promise and he had a dream:to travel to Africa to volunteer at a lion reserve. When he finally makes it,it isn’t for the reasons he imagined…Ben and Andrew keep meeting in unexpectedplaces, and the intense relationship that develops seems to be guided by fate.Or is it? What if the very thing that draws them togetheris tainted by past secrets that threaten everything?A dark, consuming drama that shifts fromZimbabwe to England, and then back into the past, The Lion TamerWho Lost is also a devastatinglybeautiful love story … with a tragic heart. My verdictWhile The Lion Tamer Who Lost is a love story between Andrew and Ben, it was also a love story for me - as I was bewitched by Louise Beech's stunning writing for a fourth time (having read her previous books How to Be Brave, The Mountain in my Shoe and Maria in the Moon).This is a sweeping drama of Zimbabwe, with evocative descriptions of the African landscape and two rescue lions who need to learn how to live independently. I found myself reading some of the prose again and again, with everything so vividly described that I felt I was there too. The narrative switches between Ben and Andrew (relaying their thoughts, feelings and emotions), between past and present, and between the two contrasting locations of Africa and England. The characters felt very real and, once again, reminded me of the talent shining through the pages.I believe that everyone who reads this book will take away something different. For me, it was a story of unrequited love, of families and friendships, lovers and relationships, and promises, wishes, hopes and dreams. Of feeling trapped and desperate to break free, but needing the confidence to learn to fly, with similarities between Ben's own situation and that of the lions he was caring for. It was about the strength of love and the selfless sacrifices that people make at a time of crisis, and also having the maturity and courage to deal with life's setbacks if things don't go as planned..I knew this book would be a tearjerker as soon as I immersed myself in Louise Beech's story, with her poetic words leaping off the page like little sparks of light. I had tissues, chocolate and counselling service on standby by the time I reached the end. Each one of her books is unique - nothing like her previous ones, but just as compelling and compassionate. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!"},
{"title": "Author Catch Up: GX Todd", "date": "Tuesday 19 June 2018", "text": "It's taken me a while to get to Defender and Hunted by GX Todd. I read the first book in January 2018 and have only just read the second book, which is being published later this month. It made sense to read them reasonably close together, as they are the first two books in a planned quartet. Here's my Author Catch up with a double review.Defender and Hunted are the first two books in The Voices series. My suggestion is to read them as I have done - buy both and read them in succession, so then you don't need to recap on the story of the first one before you read the second. Obviously I then have to wait to read books three and four, as this is a quartet. BUT there is no way I could have waited until all four books were published to start reading this series!Defender: Publisher's descriptionIn a world where long drinks are in short supply, it's dangerous to listen to your inner voice.Those who do, keep it quiet.But one man listens to the voice in his head telling him to buy a lemonade from the girl sitting on a dusty road.There is a reason why Pilgrim and Lacey must cross paths.They just don't know it yet . . . #HearTheVoices Hunted: Publisher's descriptionThe birds are flying. The birds are flocking. The birds sense the red skies are coming.One man is driven by an inner voice that isn't his - this Other is chewing at his sanity like a jackal with a bone and has one purpose.To find the voice hiding in the girl. She has no one to defend her now. But in an inn by the sea, a boy with no tongue and no voice gathers his warriors. Albus must find the girl, Lacey . . . before the Other does. And finish the work his sister Ruby began.My verdict of both booksI enjoyed both Defender and Hunted, though they did provide a slightly different reading experience each time. The writing in both books is stunning, with descriptions that made me startle, grimace, laugh and cry. Author GX Todd left me feeling, tasting, hearing and seeing everything she described, vividly in my own head as if I had a voice in there too. The books are graphic, violent and bloody - so they are not always an easy read - but also compelling, gripping and heartbreaking. They are filled with hope and emotion, as people begin to build relationships, forge friendships and develop communities. The characters are real and convincing - ordinary people pitted against the dangers of a broken society, with an unknown force (or voices) in control.In Defender, we're pulled into a world where some people can hear (and even talk to) their inner voice. We're introduced to Lacey, a girl on the cusp of adulthood, and Pilgrim, a mysterious man with a mysterious past and an inner voice with attitude. The book looks at the worst (and sometimes best) side of human nature, as people fight for survival in a post-apocalyptic setting. The world has been destroyed by human behaviour, triggered by voices in people's heads, leaving no leadership, authority figures or even organised society. The voices in The Defender are far more than a conscience - they are independent, with the power to lead you to kill yourself and others. Niggling at you, urging you, driving you crazy - with no escape. But it seems that not all voices are bad - and not all voices are equal.Defender is compelling and addictive, with definite reminders of The Walking Dead, of which I am a huge fan. Straight away, we're introduced to the main characters through vivid descriptions, not just of their outward appearances but their inner thoughts too. I guess it helps when there's someone else inside their head for them to talk to - though not everyone has an inner voice. Defender is certainly an action-packed thriller, with each chapter reading like an episode of a TV series. And it left me hungry for more, so it was just as well I had Hunted waiting patiently on my Kindle.Hunted follows on from Defender, with tension mounting as some of the original characters continue along their journey, running from danger and trying to keep those around them safe. They are being hunted by new characters, some good and some bad - though it's not actually clear which are which until later on in the book. No one knows where the voices have come from, why they exist or what they want. But it's clear that some, if not all, have their own agenda, leading the characters along a twisty, and often dangerous, path until they all converge.Hunted wasn't what I expected at first, I'm not going to lie. It starts off with different characters to Defender, which left me somewhat confused, trying to keep track of them. It also started off at a slower pace, setting the scene and introducing each of the character groups in turn. Yet despite feeling a little lost, I ploughed on and eventually couldn't put this book down either, as the tension and action reached full throttle. As with Defender, Hunted is filled with amazing descriptive writing, with plenty of sadness, humour, shocks and surprises amid the darkness. Eventually old and new characters collided, with plenty of sparks and an explosive ending. While Hunted doesn't necessarily answer many questions or tie up many loose ends, some things started to make sense, though this then led to more questions circulating around in my head.Defender and Hunted have definitely left me wanting more, and I could certainly hear my own 'inner voices' by the time I turned the final page! I can't wait for the next instalment in The Voices series!Defender was published by Headline on 12 January 2017.Hunted is being published by Headline on 31 May 2018."},

AUTHORSI love almost everything that Harlan Coben writes. His narrative is so immersive – he speaks my kind of language, and his plots are so well crafted. I especially enjoyed Six Years as you never know who you’re listening to and who you should trust. The same applies to Clare Mackintosh’s I Let You Go. I love getting to the end of a book and having everything I thought was true, turned on its head.... FILMS/MOVIESPrimal Fear stayed with me for a long time after I watched it, and clearly still has an effect on me 20 years later! The ending shook me to the core – it was one of those moments when I looked around me with my mouth agape, thinking, ‘what the……..?’ It also introduced me to Edward Norton, one of my favorite actors, who, in my opinion, is hugely under-rated.... TV DRAMASCracker, starring Robbie Coltrane, was a show I never missed in the 1990’s. It was the first time I’d seen a police drama with such an emphasis on the psychology behind the crime. I guess today’s equivalent would be Luther, as Idris (and his coat) seem to know what makes a killer’s mind tick!... FICTIONAL KILLERSIf it’s allowed, I’d like to say the women of Pirriwee in Big Little Lies. Although we know only one of them is the killer, I love the fact that they stood in solidarity, so the police had to charge them all or none at all. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Julien Baptiste in The Missing is, for me, the epitome of a detective. He’s an old school sleuth, being dragged, kicking and screaming into contemporary crime-solving. There are no airs and graces, no political correctness, no holding back, yet he’s still charm personified and boy, does he get the job done?... MURDER WEAPONSThe crossbow and arrow used in Lionel Shriver’s We Need to Talk about Kevin,for the ultimate heart-stopping moment.    ... DEATH SCENESThe most bizarre and yet incredibly moving death scene is the jellyfish in the bath in Seven Pounds. The care and attention that is put into creating the perfect death, so that others are able to benefit is extraordinary and had me crying for hours!  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m a late comer to Facebook, but it’s a great source for advice and fact-checking. There are groups and clubs for every subject under the sun, whether it be crime research, writing guidance or if you just want to sound an idea out amongst fellow writers/readers.I also rely heavily on www.thesaurus.com as I can spend half a day thinking of the word that’s on the tip of my tongue!... WRITING TIPSStart. Simple, but true. Every day there will be reasons not to write and every day we berate ourselves for not getting on with it. But once you start, you’re off and away. And be open to the idea of writing anywhere. I wrote The Other Woman on an Ipad, in waiting rooms, hairdressers and on public transport!... WRITING SNACKSI start off the morning with blueberries, a banana and almonds. By the afternoon, I’m so chuffed with my healthy eating regime that I reward myself with crisps, chocolate and biscuits!About SANDIE JONESSandie Jones is a freelance journalist and has contributed to The Sunday Times, Daily Mail, Woman’s Weekly and Hello magazine, amongst others.

AUTHORSGraham Greene and John Le Carre. I was approached to work for the security services after University and since then my fascination with all things espionage has been extreme. But beyond just your average spy thriller, these two writers also give great insights into the human condition. Beautiful writers that really pack a punch each time.... FILMS/MOVIESOliver Stone’s ‘JFK’. That was as thrillers go perfect. Multi-layered, suspenseful and actually scared me in a few places. ... TV DRAMASThe X Files. For me the ultimate show. Everything else that came after it borrowed so heavily from it, as a fan I can see the hangover even to this day. The chemistry between the leads, the terrifying storylines, the complex characters and villains, the mindblowing mysteries. I seriously cannot rate this show highly enough, and it changed me in so many ways and I think people can see my own TXF hang-ups in my novels.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThe Jackal from The Day of the Jackal. I love blindingly clever villains like Hanniabl Lecter and Dr Alex Thorne from Angela Marson’s Kim Stone series, and the Jackal is just that. The way he manipulates, plots and ruthlessly kills to keep his identity secret, it’s fascinating. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Mulder and Scully of course. I loved how Mulder is the sensitive one in a way, the spiritual one, whereas Scully is clever, logical, tough and still able to be vulnerable. Scully especially is a blueprint I think for every hero I write whether they are male or female.... MURDER WEAPONSJo Nesbo. He comes up with the craziest murder weapons. That ball thing from Phantom? And the teeth in The Thirst? It’s like he’s Googling these warped weapons and then building his novels around them.     ... DEATH SCENESNot really crime but Thelma and Louise. I never felt so uplifted and positive after the death of anyone. It was a very weird feeling.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESUniversity libraries. Academic papers are the best for ideas and research. Really would recommend it to anyone, it’s more bizarre, fun and cutting edge than any google search.... WRITING TIPSIf you want to write because you want to be the next J K Rowling then you will probably fail. Write because you love to write even if no one is publishing you yet. It’s a calling I think, and you will find your audience. Oh and the first draft is always shit. Don’t worry. ... WRITING SNACKSCake.

Here you have a police team (and potentially the capital city) in crisis, with fears of a deadly virus on the loose. It's a race against the clock in case the killer strikes again.Alex Caan has written a gripping, fast-paced crime thriller. He kept me guessing all the way through, as key characters (Kate and Zain) struggled to unravel the truth about who killed this senior civil servant, and why. The plot is complex, steeped in science and politics, with plenty of twists, turns and surprises throughout - and a few 'heart in the mouth' moments too.Both Kate and Zain have complicated pasts and secrets to hide, with regular 'reveals' about their backgrounds fleshing out their characters and triggering intense emotions in both of them. While they're battling their demons, they're put their own lives in danger, which really ramps up the pace. There are plenty of other larger-than-life characters too, turning this into a fun read despite it's dark undertones. While First to Die could be read as a standalone, I recommend reading Cut to the Bone first. I'm looking forward to seeing what Alex Caan comes up with next!"},
{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Scott Pack", "date": "Wednesday 13 June 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome SCOTT PACKEditor-at-LargeatEye/Lightning Books(and other freelance roles elsewhere!)What and when was your first job in publishing?My first job was as commercial director at The Friday Project, having joined them from Waterstones.How long have you been working in your current job/role?I am a freelancer nowadays and have been for a few years. One of my roles is as editor-at-large at Eye & Lightning Books and I have been doing that for 18 months or so. I also acquire books for Unbound and am co-founder of Abandoned Bookshop, a digital imprint that reissues lost and forgotten books from the past.  Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?We have just published Their Brilliant Careers by Ryan O'Neill, an award-winning novel from Australia that purports to be a collection of biographies of Australian writers but is all completely made up. I think it is a work of sublime genius and everyone I have foisted a copy onto has loved it. I have this very day been offering feedback on the cover of The Hurtle of Hell by Simon Edge, an atheist comedy in which God himself is a major character. And this week we went to print with The Industry of Human Happiness, the debut novel by Telegraph music critic, James Hall, set in the early days of the gramophone industry.Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I came to publishing from book retail – I was head of buying at Waterstones for six years or so – so I think I was able to bring a bit of a commercial eye to the publishing jobs I have done, but outside of that my qualifications and experience are not typical for publishing. I didn't go to university and spent the 90s working in record shops and as a buyer at HMV's head office, all of which gave me an interesting perspective but none of which would really be seen as ideal for the career I have ended up with. I think my ability to keep things in perspective had helped me quite a lot. Publishing is full of deadlines and minor or near disasters are often on the horizon, so being able to step back and assess the situation objectively – is this really a big deal? - has been good, I think.How do you relax after a busy working day?Actually, I think it is important to find time to relax during a busy working day, so I do try to go for walks, or sit outside with a book, most days if at all possible. At the end of the day I like to cook dinner for the family and watch a movie or, predictably, read a bit more.Also, naps are great.What was the last book you read for pleasure?Last night I stayed up late to finish Circe by Madeline Miller. It was every bit as good as The Song of Achilles. I am a sucker for anything related to Greek myths but this is particularly fine.Describe your job in 15 words or less...I try to help make books a bit better and then hope people buy them.What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farMy favourite book as a child was Krabat by Otfried Preussler, so getting the chance to reissue that when I was at HarperCollins was definitely a highlight, something that would have greatly impressed the eleven-year-old me. Having Haruki Murakami write an introduction to The Miner by Natsume Soseki gave me a chance to work with my literary hero, albeit briefly. But, being honest, the next book on the horizon always feels like a highlight. OK, so they don't always turn out to be but potential is a wonderful thing!If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?Restaurant critic. I don't need much of an excuse to try out a new restaurant so might as well get paid for it. I have also reached the point in life where I really do not care about my waistline.If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Inspired by Douglas Adams, I'd go for 'Don't Panic' because, at the end of the day, most of the problems we face in publishing are minor compared to what many other people have to deal with.Thanks so much for taking part, Scott!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "Countless characters by Gunnar Staalesen", "date": "Monday 11 June 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Big Sister by Gunnar Staalesen. Gunnar talks about 'Countless characters' below! Big Sister is published by Orenda Books, and will be published in paperback on 20 June 2018.Countless charactersBy Gunnar StaalesenBig Sister is the eighteenth novel in the Varg Veumseries. The first one, which hasn’t been translated into English yet, waspublished more than forty years ago, in 1977. Number nineteen is almostfinished and will be published in Norway this autumn.During allthese years and across all these books, I have created more characters then I canremember – and I have never counted them. Some of them I have lived with on andoff over the years; others have disappeared – some dying and some retiring frompolice work. But if I leaf through one of my books and read a page here andthere, I can still recognise my characters – mostly by name – even if it isalmost forty years since I invented some of them. I can still see them clearlyin my mind, too, often because many – at least in terms of their physicalappearance – are modelled on people from real life, such as a local politician,an actor or a football player I have seen, a writer colleague, or even apublisher or a journalist that I have met, even women that I have fallen inlove with from a distance…When Istarted to write seriously, at seventeen years old, there were several writers whohad a significant impression on me: Jack Kerouac, Albert Camus, some Norwegianwriters – although still not Sjöwall & Wahlöö and Chandler (they came someyears later). Similarly, during my childhood I read and loved the great storytellers:Dumas, Hugo, Jules Verne, Stevenson, Scott – and, of course, Charles Dickens.What impressed me with Dickens was the way he created his characters: funnynames that were easy to remember, their way of speaking, and their set ofphysical characteristics. All his characters are painted so vividly, you can seethem before your eyes as you read – and at that age I read a lot of Dickens’novels. Although I didn’t go on to write books in his style, I tried to worklike him when creating my own characters. In fact, there is a lot of Dickens incrime fiction – for example, you can easily see how Chandler builds characterin the same way in his books. And there is a huge character-creating traditionin English-language writing, from Shakespeare to Dickens to Chandler, and a lotmore names I haven’t the room to mention!The actionin the Varg Veum novels starts in 1976 and BigSister takes place in 2003. Clearly, Varg has grown older during theseyears – he was thirty-four at the beginning and now he’s sixty-one. The same hashappened to all the characters around him, of course. The police officers hemeets in the first part of the series are all retired now, apart from Hamre,who will retire after the book I am writing now. Women have come and gone too.His wife, from who he was already divorced in the first book, has a girlfriendnow; his son, who was a small child in the first book, has a son himself, makingVarg a grandfather. (His son is a professor in literature at the University ofOslo, and we do not meet him much in the later part of the series.) Hisjournalist best friend died some years ago, after playing an important role asan informant in many of the books, and Karin, his girlfriend and wife-to-be, diedin one of the most recent books published in the UK. During all the books I tryto keep track of these characters – their ages, their occupations, their looksetc. – so that I do not make any mistakes. But it is not a failsafe archive, sosome smaller mistakes have occurred over the years.In1997-2000, when I wrote my trilogy about Norway, Europe and the world in the twentiethcentury – some years before Ken Follett and Jan Guillou did the same – I toldthe stories of several families in Bergen. One of these was the tale of VargVeum’s parents: what happened to them before they met, how they came to meet, andthe story of their marriage. As in most families, they had their secrets. Oneof these was about Varg’s older half-sister, who was born in another townbefore his mother went to Bergen and met his father, the tram conductor fromthe fjords. This secret is one of the elements in my most recent Varg book, andis one of the reasons that the novel has the title Big Sister.Varg’ssister’s name is Norma. She was a character who I loved creating and I hope allmy readers will like her too. About Gunnar StaalesenGunnarStaalesen was born in Bergen, Norway in 1947. He made his debut at the age of22 with Seasons of Innocence and in 1977 he published the first book inthe Varg Veum series. He is the author of over 20 titles, which have beenpublished in 24 countries and sold over five million copies. Twelve filmadaptations of his Varg Veum crime novels have appeared since 2007, starringthe popular Norwegian actor Trond Epsen Seim, and a further series is beingfilmed now.

And then things get personal…My verdictI've read a few Varg Veum books now (thanks to the fantastic translations by Don Bartlett through publisher Orenda Books). Big Sister is definitely my new favourite (so far).In Big Sister, Veum is looking into the disappearance of a young woman, prompted by a surprise visit by his half-sister (a woman he didn't even know existed until now). This is a haunting story of hidden pasts, family secrets, fathers and fatherhood and troublesome relationships between parents and children - as Veum not only searches for the young woman, but also explores his own past.The Varg Veum books are gradually coming into the modern age, with mobile phones and computers becoming more popular. Big Sister also features some very contemporary themes, with plenty of darkness lurking beneath the surface. Yet this book (as with Gunnar Staalesen's previous books) still has a traditional 'private eye' feel to it, which I love. Here is a detective used to using his head rather than the tools around him to investigate, explore and do his job. Veum is a man with strong principles and a nose for trouble. But he still manages to put himself into danger several times, ramping up the pace of the book and providing several nail-biting scenes.Big Sister is perfectly packaged Nordic crime fiction, with its amazing sense of place and chilling plot - one particular scene left me feeling cold (not many books have that effect on me). I finished the book feeling a little sadder and more thoughtful then when I began its rollercoaster journey. The words flew off the page, thanks to the taunt writing and seamless translation, and I'm looking forward to the next one in the series.Follow the Blog TourDays of Wonderby Keith StuartPublished by Sphere (7 June 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionTom, single father to Hannah, is the manager of a tiny localtheatre. On the same day each year, he and its colourful cast of part-timeactors have staged a fantastical production just for his little girl, a momentof magic to make her childhood unforgettable.But there is another reason behind these annual shows: thevery first production followed Hannah's diagnosis with a heart condition thatboth of them know will end her life early. And now, with Hannah a funny, toughgirl of fifteen on the brink of adulthood, that time is coming. With the theatre under threat of closure, Hannah and Tom havemore than one fight on their hands to stop the stories ending. But maybe, justmaybe, one final day of magic might just save them both.My verdictDays of Wonder is a bittersweet story of a close father-daughter relationship.Hannah was diagnosed with a serious heart condition as a young child. Yet she tries to take it all in her stride - her hospital appointments, her symptoms and the knowledge that she has no need to plan for her future, as it's unlikely she'll reach adulthood. Tom, her father, is a single parent, living every day as if it's their first and their last, trying to keep the magic and wonder alive for his daughter, and his daughter alive with them.I cried and laughed my way through Days of Wonder - and then cried again. Some people may find it a bit too sweet for their taste, but it was pure (and perfect) escapism for me as I became totally absorbed into the lives of Tom, Hannah and their actor friends.This uplifting book is touching and moving and felt very real, with some quirky characters that will be hard to forget. Keith Stuart has tackled emotional health issues with sensitivity but also some gentle humour to lighten the load.Days of Wonder is about love, hope and second chances. It's a story of growing up, of parenthood and of creating powerful everlasting memories for the future. And that sometimes parents have to let go... and let their children grow up, despite wanting to cushion them forever.Follow the Blog Tour"},

So the killer is still there and possibly one of the locals - but they're all very reluctant to talk.I love Kate Rhodes' poetic writing (she's an award-winning poet as well as a crime fiction author). It's written to be read out loud, with its gentle rhythm and pace, as she highlights the beauty and dangers of this remote island setting. I was totally absorbed within the pages, thanks to the stunning prose, intriguing characters, atmospheric descriptions and gripping fast-paced plot.This is a 'locked room' scenario, with a smallish cast of characters and a close-knit community - many have a possible motive and something to hide. This makes it much harder for Ben Kitto to search for the truth, having to investigate people he's known his whole life and being unable to scratch any of them off his suspect list. While most of the chapters are from Ben's point of view, there are also some chapters focusing on a woman called Rose who is searching for her son Sam.Hell Bay is filled with tension and surprises, as Ben Kitto untangles a complex web of secrets and lies. The book definitely kept me guessing until the end. And I was very excited to discover that there's another Ben Kitto novel on its way (published in 2019) - can't wait!"},
{"title": "The Craftsman by Sharon Bolton", "date": "Tuesday 5 June 2018", "text": "The CraftsmanBy Sharon BoltonPublished by Trapeze (3 May 2018)Publisher's descriptionDevoted father or merciless killer?His secrets are buried with him.Florence Lovelady's career was made when she convictedcoffin-maker Larry Glassbrook of a series of child murders 30 years ago. Likesomething from our worst nightmares the victims were buried...ALIVE.Larry confessed to the crimes; it was an open and shut case.But now he's dead, and events from the past start to repeat themselves. Did she get it wrong all those years ago? Or is there something much darker at play?My verdictThe Craftsman was creepy and unsettling from the start. A combination of crime, horror and gothic mystery - a page-turning 'chiller thriller' - this is a throwback to Sharon Bolton's earlier novels (Sacrifice, Blood Harvest and Awakening), which I first discovered and fell in love with several years ago.The book is set in 1969 and 1999. Assistant Commissioner Florence Lovelady has returned to Pendle Witch County to witness the funeral of the man she convicted of a series of child murders 30 years earlier - a case that not only consumed her every waking moment at the time, but one that nearly ended her own life. She's a wonderful character - quirky and feisty, courageous yet vulnerable, determined but soft-centred - with a highly compelling narrative voice. Needing to prove herself in a male-dominated environment in her early days as a junior detective, she was prepared to battle every step of the way to solve the case.The Craftsman was a one-sitting read. I felt spellbound to keep turning the pages. The writing is suitably bare but beautifully descriptive, with realistic dialogue that keeps the plot flowing at a cracking pace. I really couldn't put the book down until I'd discovered all of its secrets. I did have an inkling about what was going on, and was right about a few things, but there were so many secrets to be discovered.This is certainly one of the creepiest books I've read. Just holding the book makes my hands tingle with anticipation, as I know that I'll be diving into it again (at least once)."},

However, I do have a great deal of general office/admin/reception/hospitality experience (part of my job is on reception and phones), as well as other internships and work experience placements, which have all been hugely relevant. If I have learnt one thing, it's not to underestimate the usefulness of basic administration and people skills.How do you relax after a busy working day?I’m still fairly new to London, so I’m making the most of itby going to the theatre, comedy nights and trying all the bars and restaurantson offer - there’s always something going on in this city.What was the last book you read for pleasure?Yesterday I picked up FlourBabies by Anne Fine. Although Anne is technically one of our authors, it’snot anything to do with work and I just love her writing – perhaps even more soas an adult. And as you can probably see on the @DHABooks Twitter, I’m alsodipping in and out of the Horrible Geography box set.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Steve Cavanagh", "date": "Friday 1 June 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome STEVE CAVANAGHfor his Thirteen blog tourto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSGod, so many. Lee Child, Michael Connelly, John Connolly,Mark Billingham, Patricia Highsmith, Val McDermid…I could go on for pages. Eachof these authors and many more I could name have had an influence on me. I’mgoing to pick one author you should read, and that’s Ross MacDonald. His LewArcher series is one of the cornerstones of crime fiction. Read Blood Money,The Zebra-Striped Hearse and The Chill. This man put heart, wit and eleganceinto the private detective novel. He’s not read so much these days, and RaymondChandler tends to get more attention. MacDonald is by far the better novelist.... FILMS/MOVIESThis is even worse. I’m going to recommend a film whichmaybe some of your readers haven’t seen. It’s The Seven Samurai, directed byAkira Kurosawa. It’s a 1954, Japanese, black and white Samurai movie which willput some people off, but the characters, the story and the sheer spectacle ofthe thing will have you on the edge of your seat. It’s a masterpiece. You mightcry. It will haunt your thoughts for days and weeks afterwards and you’llrecognise scenes and images which have been copied (but never bettered) byHollywood for decades afterwards. And yes, it is a crime film. And so muchmore.... TV DRAMASOne show stands head and shoulders above all others at themoment. Billions. It’s on Sky Atlantic, and it stars Damian Lewis and PaulGiamatti. The show is written by Brian Koppelman and David Levien who wroteRounders, Oceans 13 and more. It is by some way the smartest show on TV.Giamatti is the US attorney gunning for Bobby Axelrod (Lewis) billionaire andhead of Axe Capital. It’s a chess match, played with real people. It hasprobably overtaken The Wire, The Shield, and The Sopranos for me as myfavourite show of all time.... FICTIONAL KILLERSIt’s got to be Hannibal Lecter, right? If anyone has readSilence Of The Lambs, or Red Dragon, then their favourite killer has to beHannibal. He’s very polite. A nice guy. You could imagine yourself having avery entertaining evening together, but deep down you know he’s a totalmonster. Yep, it’s got to be Hannibal the Cannibal. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Sherlock Holmes. The ultimate detective. I don’t thinkanyone has written a better one.... MURDER WEAPONSSteel baseball bat. There is nothing more visceral, brutalor disturbing than watching that scene from Scorcese’s Casino, or the twinsfight scene from Raid 2 Berendal. If you think you have a strong stomach, andcan tolerate violence – watch those scenes. Not for the faint hearted.    ... DEATH SCENESThe end of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Come on, it’sthe best! Paul Newman and Robert Redford were never better. At the end of thefilm you’ve got the whole Bolivian army waiting for them, and yet out they go,guns blazing. It’s perfect.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m going to recommend a podcast instead. Marc Maron’s WTF.A weekly, sometimes twice a week, dose of great conversation, fascinatinginsights and occasionally you get to hear two people making a genuineconnection. Maron is one of the best interviewers I’ve ever heard, and he getsthe best guests. Just listen to one or two episodes and you’ll be completelyhooked.... WRITING TIPSREAD. Read the best. Read Elmore Leonard. Read RaymondChandler. Read James Lee Burke. Read Thomas Harris. Read Patricia Highsmith.Read Lee Child. Learn what makes their plots work. How they portray characters.The structural tricks they use in their novels and how that shapes it andsometimes fools you, or gives you a different perspective. Read Elmore Leonard,James Lee Burke, Lee Child and Chandler out LOUD. You don’t so much as readtheir work as sing it. There is a rhythm, a beat, a music to the words they puton the page – with Leonard it’s in the dialogue, with Burke in it’s in thepoetic description, with Chandler it’s in everything, with Lee it’s a freighttrain of suspense in every single line. Learn from them.... WRITING SNACKSGallons of coffee and the occasional digestive. Or a doughnutif I need a sugar rush.About STEVE CAVANAGHSteve was born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

And Kane has killed to get the best seat in the house.But there's someone on his tail. Someone who suspects that the killer isn't the man on trial.Kane knows time is running out - he just needs to get to the conviction without being discovered.My verdictWow, I really did love Thirteen, and this sums up my thoughts:In case you can't read my writing (most people can't, so you're not alone), it says: 'A nail-biting, page-turning rollercoaster ride of a read!!'.This is the fourth book in the Eddie Flynn legal thriller series - I've read the first two (The Defence and The Plea) and still need to read the third (The Liar). It didn't matter that I'd missed one out, as it didn't take me long at all to get back into the characters' lives and remember how much I love Eddie Flynn.Thirteen is such a clever read, with a highly intelligent and very organised serial killer (a master in deception) on the jury. So you, as the reader, know exactly who it is - or do you? This has a gripping, twisty plot from beginning to end, with an intriguing hook that pulled me in straight away. Although there are plenty of courtroom scenes, there's so much else going on too, from getting inside the mind of the serial killer to following Eddie's personal dramas.This really is a nail-biting read - the type of book that's hard to put down and keeps you reading into the early hours. And it's also great fun. Even the courtroom scenes are fast-paced, shocking and highly entertaining.If you like legal thrillers, courtroom dramas and/or serial killer crime novels with a fantastic lead character and plenty of humour, then pick up all of the Eddie Flynn series - and start reading them now!"},
{"title": "Come And Find Me by Sarah Hilary", "date": "Thursday 31 May 2018", "text": "Come And Find MeBy Sarah HilaryPublished by Headline (22 March 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionOn the surface, Lara Chorley and Ruth Hull have nothing incommon, other than their infatuation with Michael Vokey. Each is writing to asadistic inmate, sharing her secrets, whispering her worst fears, craving hisattention.DI Marnie Rome understands obsession. She's finding it hardto give up her own addiction to a dangerous man: her foster brother, StephenKeele. She wasn't able to save her parents from Stephen. She lives with thatguilt every day. As the hunt for Vokey gathers pace, Marnie fears one of thewomen may have found him - and is about to pay the ultimate price.My verdictI admit that I wrote no review notes when reading Come And Find Me, as I was simply too engrossed to pick up a pen, so I'm writing this 'blind'. Yet even a month on, I can still feel the chilling nature of this intelligent police procedural, as if I've only just finished reading it - I suspect that will be hard to shake off!Come And Find Me is Sarah Hilary's best book yet - and I know I keep saying that every time I read her latest novel! But seriously, this is a compelling and addictive read, pulling the punches from the very first page. It's also dark - very dark - and certainly her darkest yet, focusing on a prison riot and subsequent escape, with a violent man (Michael Vokey) now on the run.DI Marnie Rome is back to fighting her own demons, struggling to focus on her search for Vokey. Her mind keeps swinging back to her foster brother Stephen, who killed her parents and has been injured during the prison riot. To understand her relationship with Stephen fully, you'll need to read the previous books (although this isn't essential for the plot of Come And Find Me, I would recommend you do so anyway). Marnie is concerned that Vokey could be a danger to two women he befriended while in prison and who have been writing to him, craving his attention, so the race is on to find him before he finds them.There's a real mystery at the heart of Come And Find Me, shielded by so many layers that need to be torn away one by one to discover the truth. Most of the book is set in the prison or a hospital ward, yet despite these potentially neutral settings the writing is filled with descriptive brilliance and some subtle (and not so subtle) humour at times. I felt like I was there in that prison riot, not only seeing the gore and the violence, but feeling it too.I can't recommend this Marnie Rome series high enough. It's everything I want in crime fiction - dark, powerful, emotional, gripping and filled with surprises from beginning to end. It also feels very authentic - with plausible realistic plots and no far-fetched plot devices simply there to keep the reader reading. Each book touches on human nature and complex social issues and I always feel that I see the world slightly differently by the time I reach the end."},

But he knowsthe nine times out of ten, it's someone the victim knew.That means someone is lying...And that Daisy's time is running out. My verdictI raced through this cleverly plotted crime novel, which combines psychological thriller and police procedural. It's a very twisty, fast-paced read, with plenty of intriguing characters.Eight-year-old Daisy Hunter went missing from a family party and no one saw her leave, or so they say. With no strong leads, DI Adam Fawley struggles to unravel this complex case to find the missing girl, questioning her dysfunctional family, neighbours, school teachers and even friends.I loved the use of social media, with Facebook posts and tweets reflecting modern culture and the public's opinions, giving the book a very 'up-to-date' feel. This also made the story feel very real - and the characters too. I found myself questioning everyone's intentions and actions as I turned the pages.Cara Hunter certainly keeps readers guessing all the way through Close to Home. This is a great debut, so I was delighted to discover that it's the start of a series. I'm looking forward to the next book!"},

But Drake's secret pastis threatening to destroy everything.My verdictYet again, Mark Hill has written a gripping crime thriller. I loved His First Lie (originally called Two O'Clock Boy), so was excited to read It Was Her, which is the next book in the DI Ray Drake series.It Was Her focuses on dysfunctional families (okay, let's call them EXTREMELY dysfunctional families) and toxic relationships. It's filled with unreliable characters with distorted memories, hidden secrets and disturbing pasts.This book is VERY dark and VERY twisted, with an air of mystery throughout, not just with the main plot, but also with the lead character Ray Drake. He's a complicated character to understand (conflicted, moody and damaged), and I can't say too much without revealing spoilers. To know more about his background, and his strained relationship with DS Flick Crowley, you should really read His First Lie before this book.Mark Hill's writing is a pleasure to read, as it was in His First Lie too, with realistic dialogue and chilling descriptions of gruesome murders. With both books, I've found myself sympathising with some dubious characters, proving that not everything in life is clearcut and there's a definite grey area between 'good' and 'evil'. Can people really atone for the past?It Was Her certainly kept me on my toes, trying to figure it all out (who was really to blame for events in the present and in the past?) and also left me wanting more (in a good way).

{"title": "What makes the best crime fiction? by Paul E. Hardisty", "date": "Thursday 24 May 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Absolution by Paul E. Hardisty. Absolution is the fourth book in the Claymore Straker series, which is published by Orenda Books, and will be published in paperback on 30 May 2018.What makes the best crime fiction? By Paul E. HardistyRealism, to me, makes the best crimefiction. When I read thrillers and crime stories (or any other literature forthat matter), I don’t want to suspend my disbelief, I want to shudder with therealisation of what is possible, and what people are capable of, good and bad. Agreat example is the novel-within-a-novel HHhH by Laurent Binet. It is thestory of the assassination in 1942 of Nazi SS Obergruppenfuhrer ReinhardHeidrich by a team of Czech soldiers who parachuted into Prague specificallyfor the mission. It is a novel, but the chilling reality of the tale adds apoignancy and punch that a purely invented story simply cannot.Sowhen I write, I go to real events for inspiration. In my first novel, The Abrupt Physics of Dying, I usedpersonal experience of working as a young engineer in the wilds of Yemen ascivil war erupted around me, corruption ran unchecked, and powerful menscrambled to control the country’s developing oil resources, to build the story.  Fictionalising people and events around thatreality, paradoxically, allowed me to tell the truth about what was happeningthen in a way my official scientific reports never could. In the thirdinstalment of the Claymore Straker series, Reconciliationfor the Dead, I take the reader back to 1980, onto the front line of alittle-known war in Angola, when apartheid South Africa was fighting againstthe communists. One of the central plot elements of the book revolves around anobscure but bone-chilling secret program run by the South African government ofthe time, designed to keep the black populace in check. I had heard anecdotallyof the existence of such a program many years before, when as a boy, I heard myfather speaking with white South Africans who had fled the violence. Later, Iheard similar stories from a hardened South African army veteran I met workingin the oilfields of the Ukraine. So when it came time to write of ClayStraker’s harrowing past growing up as a child of apartheid, and foundreference to these same events in the Truth and Reconciliation Commissiontranscripts, I knew it had to come into the story. The fourth Straker novel, Absolution, out now, is set in Egypt andEast Africa, places I have worked in over many years and know well. Again, thekey plot elements are built around true events and issues, one of which Iexperienced first-hand, quite intimately, and the other which (thank God) I onlyheard about in the news at the time (1997).  Either way – personal experience or research – these true-life settingsallow the rest of the fiction to be anchored in something which is even morethrilling, even more chilling, because it is absolutely real.  That, to me, is the best of crime fiction.About AbsolutionAbsolutionBy Paul HardistyPublished by Orenda Books (E-book- available now; Paperback - 30 May 2018)Publisher's descriptionIt is 1997, eight months since vigilante justice-seeker Claymore Straker fled South Africa after his explosive testimony to Desmond Tutu’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In Paris, Rania LaTour, journalist, comes home to find that her son and her husband, a celebrated human rights lawyer, have disappeared. On an isolated island off the coast of East Africa, the family that Clay has befriended is murdered as he watches. So begins the fourth instalment in the Claymore Straker series, a breakneck journey through the darkest reaches of the human soul, as Clay and Rania fight to uncover the mystery behind the disappearances and murders, and find those responsible. Events lead them both inexorably to Egypt, where an act of the most shocking terrorist brutality will reveal not only why those they loved were sacrificed, but how they were both, indirectly, responsible. Here's a snippet of my review: 'The Claymore Straker series is impactful and thought-provoking, highlighting the damage humans can do, not only to each other but also to the planet.

Events lead them both inexorably to Egypt, where an act of the most shocking terrorist brutality will reveal not only why those they loved were sacrificed, but how they were both, indirectly, responsible. My verdictAbsolution is an ecothriller set againsta backdrop of social and political upheaval. It's passionate, powerful andfiery - with author Paul E. Hardisty's own passions shining through the pages, inhis vivid descriptions, taut writing and complex plot. This booktook me on an emotional journey, with heartbreak from the start. ClaymoreStraker in East Africa witnesses the murder of a family close to him, while inParis his former lover, journalist Rania LaTour, discovers her husband andyoung son have gone missing. Both Clay and Rania search for the truth, withtheir paths eventually converging in Cairo, Egypt, leading them to uncover aterrifying act of terrorism in a race against the clock.Every bookin the Clay Straker series provides a different reading experience (this bookis the fourth one) - with each book being just as satisfying and beautifullywritten as the previous one. Certainly, for me, this is the most emotionallycharged book in the series so far. I do think that you need to read all of thebooks in order (and I would recommend you do so anyway, as they're allfantastic) to get to know the main characters and understand their personalstories - together, as well as when they're apart. Mostchapters focus on Clay's search for the murderers, but there are someparticularly emotional chapters from Rania, in the form of letters written toClay. She knows he's very unlikely to ever read these letters, but he's theonly person in her head as her world is falling apart, and she pours her heartand soul into every word.Paul E. Hardisty's action thrillers are very real and authentic. They are fast pacedand gripping, filled not only with action scenes but also some reflectivemoments. They are graphic in places, violent too - but nothing that isn'tessential for the plot. This book literally took my breath away. I read it intwo intense sittings, glued to the pages - nervous about what lay ahead forClay and Rania, but also unable to tear myself away. TheClaymore Straker series is impactful and thought-provoking, highlighting thedamage humans can do, not only to each other but also to the planet.

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome LOUISE WALTERSPublisheratLouise Walters BooksWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My connection with publishing began in 2014 when my debutnovel Mrs Sinclair’s Suitcase waspublished by Hodder. I self-published my second novel A Life Between Us via Troubador Publishing (Matador); for my thirdnovel The Road to California I set upmy own imprint, Louise Walters Books.How long have you been working in your current job/role?I set up LWB last year, so it’s been a few months. However,I was planning for a year or so before announcing my news in September 2017. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I’ve signed two authors so far. Laura Laakso’s Fallible Justice will be out in November2018. It’s the first in her paranormal crime series Wilde Investigations. Laurais a fabulous writer and I’ve loved working with her. I’ve also signed poetHelen Kitson for her debut novel, TheLast Words of Madeleine Anderson. I describe her novel as a literarythriller. It has more twists than a game of pontoon and is beautifully written.It will be published in March 2019. I can’t wait! Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?Since a very young age, I’ve been a book lover and avidreader. Being a writer is very helpful; critiquing and reading for competitionsis also useful. I can often assess a piece of writing quickly. Less goodwriting announces itself almost immediately. The more accomplished work can beslippery… it’s not so obvious. When I’m umming and ahhing over something I knowit’s probably good! Being a busy mum has helped me learn to juggle time andmanage projects. I have occasional blips and panicky moments, but generally I’morganised and on top of tasks. I write up a new To Do list every week. Ithelps. How do you relax after a busy working day?At the moment my days are long and I’m often still at mydesk at 9pm! I do try to switch off at that point, though. I’ll have a hotdrink and watch a bit of TV with my husband. Neither of us are big TV watchersso it’s usually something simple like Judge Judy! Or I’ll go to bed and read.Reading for work and pleasure are pretty much one and the same these days. What was the last book you read for pleasure?I’m currently reading TheSpy Who Came in from the Cold by John le Carre; not my usual kind of readbut somebody recommended it on Twitter. I like to read outside my preferredgenres. Describe your job in 15 words or less...Reader, writer, editor, publisher: doing it all to the bestof my ability. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farReading Laura’s FallibleJustice for the second time on my Kindle and realising I had decided tooffer her a book deal. It was so exciting and very scary! If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I fancy having a go at being a literary agent! If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Independent, Always becauseI love being small, indie and autonomous. Thanks so much for taking part, Louise!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "City of Masks by SD Sykes", "date": "Thursday 17 May 2018", "text": "City of MasksBy SD SykesPublished by Hodder (Paperback - 25 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's description1358. Oswald de Lacy, Lord Somershill, is in Venice,awaiting a pilgrim galley to the Holy Land. While the city is under siege fromthe Hungarians, Oswald lodges with an English merchant, and soon comes underthe dangerous spell of the decadent and dazzling island state that sits on thehinge of Europe, where East meets West.Oswald is trying to flee the chilling shadow of something inhis past, but when he finds a dead man on the night of the carnival, he isdragged into a murder investigation that takes him deep into the intrigues ofthis mysterious, paranoid city.Coming up against the feared Signori di Notte, the secret police,Oswald learns that he is not the only one with something to hide. Everybody iswatching somebody else, and nobody in Venice is what he or she seems. The masksare not just for the carnival.My verdictReading City of Masks was like coming back to old friends, as I loved the first two books in the Oswald de Lacy series. This book is set seven years on from The Butcher Bird (Book 2). This time, SD Sykes transports readers to 14th Century Venice, where Oswald and his mother wait for a galley that will take them on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.City of Masks is a medieval murder mystery with an intricate plot, well-drawn characters and a realistic period setting. When the grandson of an old family friend is found murdered, Oswald is set the task of discovering the killer, due to his previous success as an amateur detective. At first he refuses but, thanks to gambling debts, he reluctantly takes on the case, in need of the financial reward.  As I expected, having read the previous books, there are lots of red herrings, twists and turns and surprises right until the end.However, City of Masks seems very different from its predecessors, and I don't mean that in a bad way at all. The first two books are set just after the Black Plague in Kent, and had a claustrophobic feel to them with a smaller cast of characters - think of them as Oswald's 'coming of age' years, as he progresses from novice monk to Lord Somershill. I would suggest that you read all three of the books in order, as City of Masks does contain a few subtle references to Oswald's past.City of Masks has a darker, almost melancholy, feel to it, set in a busy city on the cusp of war. Oswald has matured since the first two books, influenced by recent events that are revealed as the book progresses, and is struggling to fight his inner demons and overpowering feelings of depression. His domineering mother provides some light relief and entertainment amid all the darkness.Venice is one of my favourite cities and I certainly felt that SD Sykes brought it to life with her in-depth research and colourful prose, contrasting the wealth and splendour with the poverty and squalor. I look forward to seeing where Oswald finds himself next, whether it's back home in Kent or on yet another foreign adventure."},

It focuses on Olivia's seemingly idyllic life, which changes when two young girls go missing and a mysterious stranger arrives, with the potential to tear her family apart. The plot is filled with secrets and lies. It's clear that Olivia has a mysterious past, but what happened all those years ago?The book is set mainly in a small alpine village in Switzerland, which gives the book a claustrophobic feel and a small cast of characters. It's beautifully written and its stunning descriptions of the surroundings create a great sense of place. Flashbacks to the past take place in England and Scotland, providing a series of breadcrumb clues to traumatic events in Olivia's past.The characters are realistic and believable, all well described, with some quirky ones slotting some humour into the otherwise dark plot. I found myself turning the pages, determined to discover more about Olivia's secret, the mysterious stranger and the fate of the two missing girls.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "My self-publishing journey by Rodney Hobson", "date": "Monday 14 May 2018", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Rodney Hobson to Off-the-Shelf Books today to talk about his experience of self-publishing. Rodney is already a well-established journalist and author of traditionally published finance books. He has recently self-published his novel Dead Money. My self-publishing journeyBy Rodney HobsonI have justself-published a book for the first time. It was a daunting experience and Iwill probably lose money on the arrangement but the thrill of seeing my name inprint is undimmed by 50 years as a journalist and author. It helped that I have previously had books published byrecognised publishers so at least I knew the ropes.Starting with SharesMade Simple in 2007, I have now had six finance books published aspaperbacks and subsequently as ebooks by Harriman House, which specialises infinancial publications, plus a second updated edition of the first book.Traditional publishers typically pay royalties of 7.5% on paperbacks and 25% onebooks. Harriman pays using a slightly different and slightly more generoussystem.I faced a much tougher decision when Endeavour Press offeredto publish my detective stores but only as ebooks with a 30% royalty. The 'birdin the hand' view was that at last I got published and the royalty offer wasgenerous. The downside was that I would have no hope of persuading atraditional publisher to take on these books as they would want the fullrights.I took the bird in the hand. Over the past few years, publishers have preferred ever longer crime books, so it was unlikely thatanyone would look at my 45,000 word book when the norm has become 80,000. Also, I was conscious of the trend away from the type of cosy whodunit that I writeand towards gritty psychological thrillers.However, I retained the print rights, keeping open theoption of self-publishing. After Endeavour had published the first five PaulAmos Lincolnshire murder mysteries, and with a sixth started, I decided to takethe plunge.The main consideration was that the book was set in aspecific area, Lincolnshire, so there was the possibility of selling throughbookshops in the county as a local author and even setting up a stall atChristmas and summer fetes, as my wife comes from Lincolnshire and we arefrequent visitors.I already knew the very important difference between selfpublishing and vanity publishing and had no intention of taking the vanityroute. In traditional publishing, the publisher takes all thefinancial risk but retains ownership of the books and takes the larger slice ofthe proceeds. In self publishing, you publish under your own name and stand allthe costs, but you own the books and you take all the proceeds. In both cases, risk is linked to reward. Vanity publishing has the worst of both worlds: you take allthe financial risk while the publisher owns the books and takes the greaterreward. You are paying for the pretence that the publisher chose to publishyour book.I went on the Internet to find a company specialising inself publishing, and three names came up. One was a printer in Catford, justfour miles from where I live in southeast London. This had the advantage that Icould call at the premises and see its work first hand. A friend who does coverdesigns had used it and could vouch for its quality. The big drawback was thatit was only a printer and would not be able to give support in distribution.I spoke on the telephone to the other two companies, one inLondon and one in Essex, but it became clear to me that they both provided whatI regard as vanity publishing, despite their protestations to the contrary.Both would have published under their imprint and would have paid me royalties.I finally chose York Publishing Services from anadvertisement in the magazine Writers’Forum. Their deal meant the book was published under my name as publisher. Theysent a comprehensive, easy-to-read guide, so I knew exactly what was happening, and they arrange printing and have supply deals with Amazon and book retailers. As it happened, my wife and I had planned a holiday inYorkshire so I arranged to call at the YPS office on York, as I prefer to dealwith people I have met rather than communicated with entirely by email.The copyright on the cover for the ebook belonged toEndeavour, so we needed a new one. YPS would have arranged this and would have offeredme a choice of possible covers, but as I knew a book cover designer I made myown arrangements – though it is important to make sure that your designer isworking to the correct size specifications.YBS gave me a choice of typefaces and page layout styleswith a pick and mix option. Costs depend on the size of book and how many copies youhave published, but you are probably looking at about £1,400 in total to produce250 books. Any subsequent reprints work out cheaper as the book is already setup on the computer and longer print runs cost less per copy.After talking it over with YPS, I decided to print 250copies and to price the book at £7.50. Pricing is a tough choice and wasentirely my decision, although YPS was willing to give some guidance. Theinitial price will probably not cover the first print run but will, I hope,recover most of the costs and if I get sufficient sales the second run will bemore of an economic proposition. At least I can claim the costs against income tax, althoughby the same token I will naturally be obliged to declare sales as income. I chose to have 50 books sent to me and the rest remain withYPS for distribution. The choice of the split was mine and I can always ask formore books if I sell the ones I have. After all, the books belong to me.The title of the book is DeadMoney. Whether that refers to the decision to self publish as well as theplot, I am about to find out. The webpage is www.ypdbooks.com/fiction/1718-dead-money-YPD01910.html - see below for the blurb.Anyone thinking of self-publishing should allow six monthsfrom completion of the book to having a copy in your hand. You can do it fasterbut it is best not to rush, rather to think carefully about decisions. Therecan also be unexpected hold-ups – a package sent to me was delivered to thewrong house and not passed on so always keep in touch with the company handlingthe publishing.If any readers of this blog are thinking of self publishingand want to ask any questions, you are welcome to email me at rodhobson@hotmail.com and I will do mybest to help.About Rodney HobsonRodneyHobson is an experienced writer, journalist and broadcaster who has held senioreditorial positions with publications in the UK and Asia, including BusinessNews Editor at The Times.

{"title": "The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton", "date": "Thursday 10 May 2018", "text": "The Seven Deaths of Evelyn HardcastleBy Stuart TurtonPublished by Raven Books (8 February 2018)Publisher's description'Somebody's going to bemurdered at the ball tonight. It won't appear to be a murder and so themurderer won't be caught. Rectify that injustice and I'll show you the wayout.'It is meant to be a celebration but it ends intragedy. As fireworks explode overhead, Evelyn Hardcastle, the young andbeautiful daughter of the house, is killed.But Evelyn will not die just once. Until Aiden –one of the guests summoned to Blackheath for the party – can solve her murder,the day will repeat itself, over and over again. Every time ending with thefateful pistol shot. The only way to break this cycle is to identifythe killer. But each time the day begins again, Aiden wakes in the body of adifferent guest. And someone is determined to prevent him ever escapingBlackheath...My verdictI wrote so many notes while reading this book yet I’m writing this review without them, as I'm not sure they make much sense. I finished The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle with an aching head and a sense of relief, as if I'd completed a mental marathon. I read this alongside three other people and I'm so glad that I did (or rather, we did), as we had so much, possibly too much, to discuss along the way.Evelyn Hardcastle dies at Blackheath House during a party. Not just once, but seven times, and will then do so again and again - unless Aiden can solve her murder and discover the culprit, allowing him to escape Blackheath House and his 'Groundhog Day' cycle. As each day begins, Aiden wakes up in the body of a different party guest. Each time Aiden becomes his host, he learns more about them - their beliefs, their prejudices, their emotions and more. But who is Aiden? Who is the killer? And will Aiden succeed in his task? Many people will have read comparisons with Quantum Leap, Agatha Christie and Cluedo, and every one of these is right. This book is a combination of time travelling, body leaping and puzzle solving. A murder mystery written in Agatha Christie style that pulled me in and wouldn't let me leave (like Aiden) until I'd turned the final page. I was mesmerised by the prose and the underlying plot. Some guests were far more likeable than others and each had their own agenda, so it was difficult to know who to trust. I guessed some minor details and had suspicions about major ones, but nothing prepared me for what was in store.I’m naturally a logical person, but trying to apply logic to this book didn't seem to work, as I was totally lost at times, trying to fathom it all out in my head - not just the murder mystery, but the whole concept. I was left with several questions, so I'm tempted to read it again from the start and think of it as a giant logic puzzle by creating a spider chart on the wall. But then part of me isn't sure I'll ever make sense of it.The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a plotting masterpiece and was, I assume, a plotting headache for the author. I wouldn't call it a relaxing read if, like me, you're trying to work it out as you go. But it was an enjoyable experience overall, highly entertaining and a challenge. Be prepared to lose not only several hours of reading time, but your mind too."},
{"title": "Authors' Creative Pursuits - Fanny Blake", "date": "Wednesday 9 May 2018", "text": "Authors are a very creative bunch - and for many of them, this isn’t only with words on the page. From drawing to painting, pottery to needlework, composing to singing, here’s a look at some authors’ creative pursuits.I am delighted to welcome FANNY BLAKEAUTHOR OF OUR SUMMER TOGETHER(ORION BOOKS) AND AN ITALIAN SUMMER (ORION BOOKS, PUBLISHED IN JULY 2018)TO TALK ABOUT HER LOVE OF KNITTING  Have you always been creative – and not just with words? I’ve always loved making things. It started when I was a kidand made hundreds of Airfix models. I was so pleased when my children got to anage when they enjoyed that too. My mum taught me to knit and embroider but I’vebeen through phases of doing crochet, patchwork, macramé, tapestry,dress-making, you name it, but knitting is the one that’s lasted. I still lovebrowsing in a wool shop and am always tempted by the colours and textures.  When did you first learn to knit and did you start knitting for any particular reason?My mum taught me to knit so long ago that I can’t rememberif there was a reason. I suspect it was simply that she knitted and I wanted tocopy her. I remember starting with a cotton reel with four nails hammered into thetop. I’d make a long trail of knitted multi-coloured wool that I’d turn intocircular mats. After that I moved on to more advanced things. I got my Guidebadge in knitting and I remember a green jumper with a very wonky green V-neck,and a pair of unwearable socks with heels I couldn’t turn properly. Since thenI’ve got better, though I’m very far from being an expert.How often do you knit and how easy is it to find the time?I always knit whenever I’m watching TV. I do occasionallyjust sit and knit without doing anything else at the same time, but veryrarely. Do you do any other arts and crafts?I’ve just taken a course in botanical painting. It’s anextremely precise art that’s all-absorbing and extremely satisfying or, in mycase, frustrating because I find it very hard. I like the idea of doing it wellthough so have signed up for another course though I think it needs much morepractice than I’m currently able to do.Do you think knitting (or the time you spend knitting) helps with your writing and overall wellbeing?  It helps with my writing if I do it when I’m not watchingTV. It’s a little like walking in that it’s time when your conscious mind slipsand ideas bubble up from   yoursub-conscious. That’s when plot problems are sometimes solved when leastexpected.What have you knitted recently?I’ve recently knitted a cardigan for me, a jumper for afriend (she put it the washing machine and shrunk it to a doll’s size!) and onefor my daughter-in-law. At the moment I’m concentrating on baby clothes for mynew granddaughter – very satisfying because they’re so quick to do.THANKS FOR TAKING PART, FANNY!About FANNY BLAKEFanny Blakewas a publisher for many years, editing both fiction and non-fiction beforebecoming a freelance journalist and writer.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Louise Voss", "date": "Tuesday 8 May 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome LOUISE VOSSfor her The Old You blog tourto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSThere are so many candidates! But since youonly want one, I’m picking Johana Gustawsson. I recently finished her latest, Keeper, and was blown away by how engrossingher prose is, and how tense and complex her plot.  Keeperis just so different to anything else I’ve read lately, and I love the factthat it’s a multi-generational thriller.... FILMS/MOVIES3Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. Best film I’veseen in years. I cried four times, laughed my head off and was utterlytransfixed by it.  Like my favourite sortof crime novels, it doesn’t tie everything up with a neat bow and hand it tothe consumer. It’s messy and complicated, like life, and focusses more oncharacter than plot. And boy, what amazing characters they are.... TV DRAMASThe TV adaptation of Fargo. My friend and I watched it recently and a couple of weekslater we both had Fargoesque dreams (mine was on the morning of my birthday, Iwoke up from a nightmare where I’d hidden behind the shower curtain becausethere was an assassin in my house – he found me and shot me in the heart; myfriend’s was similar except that she was the killer!). Gruesome, hilarious,clever and heartwarming.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThe psychopathic bone collector in FionaCummins’ two DS Fitzroy novels, Rattle andThe Collector.  Simultaneously unbelievably scary and scarilybelievable. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES My new favourite fictional detective isManon Bradshaw, Susie Steiner’s brilliantly characterful creation in Missing, Presumed and Persons Unknown.  I could read about her all day, particularlyher ruminations on her private life, such as the traumas of being on the datingscene, which are often laugh-out-loud funny. She and I are definitely kindredspirits – she often says exactly what I would think in certain situations.... MURDER WEAPONSI am proud to say that I managed to inserta notable and slightly bizarre murder weapon into my new book, The Old You. It sounds boastful to usesomething of my own, but I can’t actually claim credit for it. That goes to thefabulous Tammy Cohen, who suggested it when I said I was looking for an unusualone… I was delighted when she came up with it! It’s specific to a veryparticular venue (which I can’t reveal because it’s too much of a spoiler…)    ... DEATH SCENESMy mind went blank although I’m sure I knowof loads. I had to appeal to Twitter and someone* (ahem!!) came up with a deathinvolving a vacuum cleaner in one of Yrsa Sigurdardottir’s The Legacy.  I haven’t readit yet but now I absolutely will, I have to see how that happens (if this is a spoiler for Yrsa, please don’t includeit!)* Vicki (or Victoria, as I'm known on this blog): NO idea who that was, Louise! *cough* (But yes, you should definitely read The Legacy!)... BLOGS/WEBSITESIt’s a boring answer but I don’t have anygo-to websites for research, just good old Google on a need-to-know basis, ortalking to my police advisors.  And Idon’t read writing websites. Too much actual writing to do!... WRITING TIPSAuthor James Law gave me a great piece ofadvice just this week: to help stay motivated, always stop writing for the dayjust after starting a new chapter orscene, not when finishing the last one. That way you have something specific tomull over in the interim period before you next sit down to write, which ishugely incentivising. (Sounds obvious really, but despite having been writingfor twenty years, this has actually never occurred to me before).... WRITING SNACKSI don’t have any! Snacking is BAD.I am not saying this because I am smug andthin. I’m saying it because I have zero will-power and once I start snacking, Icannot stop. Therefore I rarely have crisps and snacks in my house because if Ido, they’re all I can think about. Which is not conducive to plotting and highword-count; only high calorie count. BUT since you’re forcing me to think aboutit, if I did, it would be salt and vinegar Kettle crisps. About LOUISE VOSSOver her 18 year writing career, Louise has had books out via pretty much every publishing model there is, from deals with major traditional publishing houses (Transworld and Harper Collins) to digital-only (the Amazon-owned Thomas & Mercer) and self-publishing - she and co-author Mark Edwards were the first UK indie-published authors to hit the No.1 spot on Amazon back in 2011.

AUTHORSIt’s probably a tie between Megan Abbottand James Sallis. Both write brilliant books set around the edges of the crimegenre. There’s no better writer of the psychology of women and girls thanAbbott, and Sallis’s noir with a heart is the finest storytelling I’ve evercome across. ... FILMS/MOVIESI love stories about ordinary people throwninto extraordinary situations, so Fargo is just about perfect in that regard.And for tightness of plotting and wonderful dialogue, Reservoir Dogs is hard tobeat. ... TV DRAMASI was totally blown away recently by thenew Netflix adaptation of Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency by DouglasAdams. It was a very loose adaptation, but all the better for that, crazy fromstart to finish, with brilliant plotting and terrific performances. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSAnton Chigurh, the relentless hitman inCormac McCarthy’s No Country For Old Men. Just terrifying. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Claire DeWitt, written by the utterlybrilliant Sara Gran. She’s only produced two books featuring this fucked updetective, The City of the Dead and The Bohemian Highway, but there’s a thirdone, The Infinite Blacktop, coming this year. DeWitt is a genius creation,damaged in all sorts of ways but also utterly brilliant, these books areexistential noir of the highest order. ... MURDER WEAPONSNot quite a murder weapon, but in MichelFaber’s Under the Skin, the main character Isserley picks up male hitchhikersin the Scottish Highlands, then drugs them via a hypodermic syringe embedded inthe passenger seat of her car activated by a button. To be honest, that’s thebest thing that happens to her victims.     ... DEATH SCENESCarlito’s death at the end of Carlito’s Waygets me every time. Proper old-school tragedy right there.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI absolutely love The Island Review, sinceI’m totally obsessed with islands, and it fits in nicely with my latest book FaultLines. At the moment I’m researching a lot about the death industry, so TheOrder of the Good Death run by mortician Caitlin Doughty is a brilliantresource. ... WRITING TIPSJust get your arse in the seat and write. Imean, it’s utterly banal advice, but it’s really easy to procrastinate foreverand do nothing. Don’t worry about getting it right first time, Hemmingway saidthe first draft of anything is shit, so just get it on the page, and you cansort it out in the many redrafts.  ...

From drawing to painting, pottery to needlework, composing to singing, here’s a look at some authors’ creative pursuits.I am delighted to welcome ADÈLE GERASAUTHOR OF LOVE OR NEAREST OFFER(PUBLISHED BY QUERCUS)TO TALK ABOUT HER LOVE OF KNITTINGHave you always been creative – and not just with words? No I'mafraid I've always been useless at art and other pursuits. Can do nothing elsewith my hands except basic crochet. Don't sew at all....I even have togive my jeans to an alterations shop to be turned up!When did you first learn to knit and did you start knitting for any particular reason?I firstlearned at boarding school, aged 12, and HATED it and was very bad at it, constantlydropping stitches and losing my place in the pattern. I didn'tknit again till 1982. That was when I gave up smoking. My mother-in-law, abrilliant knitter, was with us at the time and she taught me to knit all overagain, as a wayof keeping my hands busy while I was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. It workedwonderfully wellHow often do you knit and how easy is it to find the time?I knitevery single day that I'm at home. I find the time by doing it in front of thetelly. I am addicted to box sets and tv in general and always spend the evenings watchingsomething or other. I would feel very silly indeed just goggling at the screenall on my won with nothing to occupy me. It's as if my knitting ALLOWS me to bea couch potato in the evenings. If I go outin the evening, then of course I miss a day. I don't often knit during the dayunless I'm in a non-writing phase. Ihave special knitting for trains: easy and using small, circular needles.Actually I always use circular needles and can't remember the last time I usedstraight ones.Do you do any other arts and crafts?None whatsoever....unlessyou count baking! Do you think knitting (or the time you spend knitting) helps with your writing and overall wellbeing?  I'm quiteconvinced that knitting is tremendously good for mental health. It's very relaxingand therapeutic in all kinds of ways. Ilove wool and make an effort to use only natural materials. Never synthetic... the handlingof the wool and the gazing at wonderful colours is great for allowing youto think. And writing does require a great deal of thought. Overallwell-being? Definitely. I would recommend it to anyone. Therepetition of a pattern is like a kind of mantra....knit two, purl two, say.Lovely!What have you knitted recently?I used toknit garments for myself: Aran, Fairisle, and so forth. Nowadays Ido only scarves, shawls, cushion-covers and blankets etc.Here's a \"WORMY\" pink cushion which I made at a cushion-making workshop. Here's also a beigeish baby blanket I have just finished.Here's apink scarf, and also a scarf in three different colours, lime, orangeand silver.Here's aHUGE blanket of squares which was what's called A KNITALONG.I boughtall the wool up front, for the whole blanket, and was then sent a differentpattern every fortnight. I loved making that and knowing that there were lotsof other people all over the world knitting it at the same time.Any knitterwho's reading this and who isn'talready a member of the internet website http://www.ravelry.com is missingout on a lot of fun.THANKS FOR TAKING PART, ADELE!About ADELE GERASAdèle Geraswas born in Jerusalem in 1944, the 7th generation of her mother's familyto be born in the city.

The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome SANJIDA KAYAUTHOR OF MY MOTHER'S SECRETTO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITMy Mother's Secret is published on today, on 3 May 2018, by Corvus/Atlantic Books. OfficeOur exciting news is that we’re renovating a house in ruralSomerset. In the meantime, we’ve downsized so I no longer have an office, but adesk in the corner of an open-plan room. I look out over a small, but beautifulgreen garden that backs onto an urban nature reserve. Jays and blue tits peepthrough the window. I can’t think if there’s any clutter, and I like to have aflower or two next to me. I work on an Apple Mac and a laptop. This hasrevolutionised my life: because everything is in the cloud, I can pick up mylaptop and go, without having to check it’s saved, and I no longer have thatawful realisation that I’ve spent hours working on the wrong document.NotebooksI love having different notebooks with lovely covers. I haveone for ideas, one for quotes and overheard snippets of conversations and aworking one, with what I need to do next. It helps me keep track of where I am- for instance, My Mother’s Secret is just about to be published out,but I’m still talking to readers about my previous thrillers, Bone by Boneand The Stolen Child, whilst editing the fourth one, The Anniversary.I find writing long-hand is a good way of generating ideas too, although Iactually type my novels straight onto the computer.ExerciseWriting is incredibly sedentary, so I need to move! I get upbefore anyone else and do an hour to an hour and a half of the Tracy AndersonMethod. Tracy is a trainer in the states; I stream her classes, which are a combinationof light weights and dance cardio. At the weekends I run or go mountain biking.I love walking. One of the characters in My Mother’s Secret lives in theLake District, so it was a great excuse to head up there for ‘research’. I findwalking helps with creativity and general resetting of one’s mentalequilibrium.Coffee and chocolateI start my writing day with black coffee and 80% darkchocolate. I’m lucky enough to have a fantastic coffee roaster, Extract, at thebottom of our road and I buy their organic espresso, which tastes of hazelnutsand cocoa. Apparently.CandlesI light a candle when I start working. I like scents thatare quite sharp when I’m concentrating: my favourite is St Eval’s Rosemary andBay; and then soothing, like Sandalwood, when I want to unwind. I love beingsurrounded by greenery so I fill the house with lots of plants.Protein shakeI get through that mid-afternoon slump with a protein shake,usually made of fruit and vegetables, non-dairy milk and protein powder. I normallyadd spinach - this one is raspberry and coconut milk.HeadphonesSince we’re all in one room, there’s quite a lot of‘negotiation’ about who gets to watch downhill mountain bike racing, How toTrain your Dragon, or have some peace and quiet to write their novel. Ispend quite a lot of time wearing headphones and pretending I can’t hear anyonespeaking to me. I listen to audiobooks and podcasts when I’m doing chores; I’ma big fan of The Story Grid podcast and book, which is by editor ShawnCoyne and is aimed at helping writers and editors improve.CakeMy daughter and I love baking: this is a cake that I madefor one of my sister’s for her birthday.

Salt Lane is published by Riverrun Books on 3 May 2018.Salt LaneBy William ShawPublished by Riverrun Books (3 May 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher’s descriptionSHE ALWAYS WENT TOO FARDS Alexandra Cupidi has done it again. She should havelearnt to keep her big mouth shut, after the scandal that sent her packing - resentfulteenager in tow - from the London Met to the lonely Kent coastline. Murder isdifferent here, among the fens and stark beaches.SHE WAS THE ONE WHO FOUND THE KILLERSThe man drowned in the slurry pit had been herded there likean animal. He was North African, like many of the fruit pickers that work thefields. The more Cupidi discovers, the more she wants to ask - but these peopleare suspicious of questions.AND NOW IT WAS KILLING HERIt will take an understanding of this strange place - its oldways and new crimes - to uncover the dark conspiracy behind the murder. Cupidiis not afraid to travel that road. But she should be. She should, by now, havelearnt.My verdictI raced through Salt Lane, from beginning to end. Yet again, as with The Birdwatcher, I was totally mesmerised by the quirky characters, chilling setting and emotional plot.Everything about this book, and William Shaw's stunning writing, is excellent. The dialogue, in particular, is so realistic that it brings each character to life and drives the plot forward at a cracking pace. The setting is stark and desolate, yet the descriptions of the coastline, marshes and fens are so vivid, providing a strong sense of place and an air of mystery.DS Alexandra Cupidi is investigating two deaths - one is a woman found floating in the water and the other is a migrant worker found floating in a slurry tank. A scandal back in London led Cupidi (and her teenage daughter, Zoe) to the bleak Kent coastline and she's still trying to fit in, remaining a little distant from her fellow police officers. But as the case continues, she's having to rely on them more and more - especially as she and her colleague Jill Ferriter put themselves into some very tricky (and potentially dangerous) situations.William Shaw covers some dark topics and contemporary issues with a splash of humour and plenty of sensitivity. This character-driven crime novel follows on from The Birdwatcher (which was a standalone), but this is the start of a new series. I don't think there's a need to read The Birdwatcher first (other than to gain some background into Cupidi and her daughter).I loved The Birdwatcher, but now love Salt Lane even more.Follow the Blog Tour"},

She wears the sameclothes to work every day, eats the same meal deal for lunch every day and buysthe same two bottles of vodka to drink every weekend.Eleanor Oliphant is happy.Nothing is missing from her carefully timetabled life. Except, sometimes,everything.One simple act of kindness isabout to shatter the walls Eleanor has built around herself. Now she must learnhow to navigate the world that everyone else seems to take for granted – whilesearching for the courage to face the dark corners she’s avoided all her life.Change can be good. Change canbe bad. But surely any change is better than… fine?My verdictEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine took me on a emotional journey, through joy, hope, sadness and despair. The writing is gorgeous and highly readable, and the story is sensitive and compassionate. This is the type of book that I will read again, to savour the descriptions and the dialogue.Eleanor is socially awkward and full of innocence with a simple, and very black-and-white, view of life, people and the world around her. It took me a little while to get inside her head, but then I couldn't let go. I fell in love with her character's quirky nature and sharp observations, and then with the book itself.Though the book isn't a crime novel or a psychological thriller, there's still an element of mystery within its pages. Eleanor can't remember something about her past, having locked it away in a corner of her mind, somewhere safe where it can't hurt her. So underneath all that naivety, some dark shadowy secrets are desperate to come out, and over time Eleanor realises that maybe she's not completely fine after all.This is a book about loneliness, love and laughter. About feeling different, overcoming obstacles and finding somewhere you belong. And about how simple acts of kindness can have a powerful impact on people's lives - those who perform them and those who receive them.Highly recommended."},

Now, ten years on, Ed has been diagnosedwith early-onset dementia, and things start to happen; things more sinisterthan missing keys and lost words. As some memories are forgotten, others, longburied, begin to surface... and Lynn's perfect world begins to crumble. But is it Ed s mind playing tricks, or hers...?My verdictThe Old You is dark domestic noir published by Orenda Books, a publisher that's well known for its quality writing. And I have to say that Louise Voss' writing in this book is outstanding.This psychological thriller provided some uncomfortable reading, tackling the emotional topic of early-onset dementia. It provoked an uneasy feeling inside me from beginning to end, as I worried about what was to come, yet I couldn't tear myself away from it. I wasn't sure what was real and what wasn't, whether everything was as it seemed or whether something more sinister was going on.Louise Voss' prose is highly compelling, creating vivid (and brilliant) imagery of people and places. I found myself right inside protagonist Lynn's head straight away as she comes to terms with her husband Ed's recent diagnosis and the disturbing changes in his behaviour. The narrative flits between past and present, as Lynn thinks back to when she and Ed first met.I won't give anything away about the plot. But I will say that The Old You is filled with jaw-dropping revelations. I had no idea where the book was heading and I was certainly surprised as I followed this twisty rollercoaster journey."},

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome EMILY BURNSDirectoratBrandHive LtdWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first job in publishing was with Constable and Robinson, who were still independent when I joined back in 2010. I absolutely loved thatjob. It was a small, hardworking and passionate team publishing some reallyexciting fiction and non-fiction authors. I’d been working in consumer PR for 3years before my first job in publishing and I soon learnt that it really is thenicest industry. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I decided to form my own PR and Communications company,BrandHive, late last year when I was on honeymoon. It was very much a ‘now ornever’ moment ,and I’m so happy I took the leap - I’ve never been happier. Iofficially left Bonnier Zaffre where I was Head of PR in early February 2018, soI’ve only been in a freelance role for a couple of months so far.Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?The book that I’m most proud to have worked on recently hasbeen The Tattooist of Auschwitz. It’sbased on the incredible true story of Lale Sokolov, who was given the job oftattooing the prisoners marked for survival at Auschwitz.  It’s also the place he met his wife. Hisstory will make you weep, but it is also one of the most uplifting storiesyou’ll ever read.In April, I’m working on the last book in the‘Maestra’ trilogy by LS Hilton, and then in May, for a total change of pace,the last children’s book from lovely Isla Fisher! In the first half of 2018,I’m also working with Tramp Press, a small Irish independent who are bringingsome really fresh voices to the market. Look out for Problems by Jade Sharma inMay and Notes to Self by Emilie Pine in July!Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I knew that if I had a hope of getting a job aftergraduating (my degree was in marketing), I had to do as many work experienceplacements as possible. Over the course of three years, I did around 10 workexperience placements. I was really lucky that one of those placements led to ajob when I graduated. PR is an amazing job but I’ve found you need to bepassionate, organised and creative. In any role, you need to be self motivatedbut to be freelance, more so than anything else.I was very lucky to have a fantastic boss in my second job in publishing (atLittle, Brown) and she taught me more than anyone else has. I certainlywouldn’t be where I am without having had support from great colleagues and thepersonal drive of knowing that my end goal was creating my own company. How do you relax after a busy working day?I usually stop working around 8/9pm then cook something fromone of my hundreds of cookbooks (it’s an addiction), pour a glass of wine, takethe dog for a walk and catch up with friends and family at the local pub.What was the last book you read for pleasure?The last book I read for pleasure was Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. BonnierZaffre didn’t publish any non-fiction (which I really missed!) so I would tryto read at least one a month in between all the great fiction!Describe your job in 15 words or less...In its purest form, PR is the art and science ofinfluencing public opinion through communications.What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farThe one thing I absolutely love is creating brand and mediapartnerships for both the publishers I’ve worked with and individual authors. Acouple of my favourites are:A media partnership with Prospect magazine for a series of co-branded events,podcasts, subscription offers and reciprocal benefitsTo launch social talent star, Louise Pentland’s first adultnovel, I originated and executed a partnership with Glossybox, who featured a sampler of Wilde Like Me in everysubscriber box, and I also devised and developed a partnership with Be At Onecocktail bars who created a ‘Wilde Like Me’ cocktail to celebrate publication.It is now a permanent fixture on their menu.I’m also really proud to have launched Isla Fisher’s series, which began with Marge in Charge twoyears ago.  We’ve worked together eversince. If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I would definitely be a movie producer. There are so manybooks I’d love to see turned into films. TallOaks and All the Wicked Girls byChris Whitaker would be the first ones I’d choose. It would be so fun to findthe literary property, shape the idea into a viable film, raise the money, hirethe director, choose the cast, oversee production and postproduction,mastermind the marketing, negotiate the worldwide rights — basically be amovie’s begetter and first demanding viewer…If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Warm wine.

Yet again, Adam Hamdy has written a gripping rollercoaster read. Some action thrillers can be read easily as standalones. But I would recommend that you read Pendulum first, if you haven't already done so, as parts of Freefall may not make sense otherwise.The reader is launched straight into the action from the very first page. After uncovering a shocking conspiracy in Pendulum, John Wallace is now hiding in Afghanistan, right in the middle of a war zone. But it's hard to stay hidden for long, as he soon discovers. DI Patrick Bailey in London and FBI agent Christine Bailey in New York are the only ones he can trust. When a London journalist is discovered dead in her home in a possible suicide, the three of them are thrust together into yet another investigation that isn't what it seems.Freefall is full of action and suspense and is highly entertaining. It's an emotional journey too, as all three characters have been left with physical and mental scars from their previous encounter. The chapters are fairly short, which helps to keep the pace moving quickly - there's so much energy within the book that I found it difficult to find time to take a breath. The plot may seem a little over the top in places - but that's the beauty of fiction, stretching the highly imaginative into pure escapism. The characters are believable and realistic, triggering plenty of shocks and surprises by the end.I raced through Freefall and can't wait to read the next book in the series."},

From drawing to painting, pottery to needlework, composing to singing, here’s a look at some authors’ creative pursuits.I am delighted to welcome ERICA JAMESAUTHOR OF COMING HOME TO ISLAND HOUSE(PUBLISHED BY ORION)TO TALK ABOUT HER LOVE OF KNITTINGHave you always been creative – and not just with words? I would say that I’ve always been creative with my hands; itstarted when I was a child.  I was sevenyears old when my father taught me to knit. I have no idea how he learned, or when, but I have a very clear memoryof him teaching me how to do stocking stitch. I can picture now the very first thing I knitted – a bright green scarfthat was actually more like a very narrow tie than anything that would keepanyone warm.It wasn’t until many years later, when I’d left home ateighteen and was lodging with a couple in Oxford that I learnt to knitproperly.  My landlady, a wonderful womanwho chain-smoked and took me to the bingo with her, was the person who reallytaught me to knit, and most importantly, how to follow a pattern.  She had the patience to sit alongside me andencourage my first attempt at knitting a jumper.As for other creative outlets, I learned to sew while atschool and for some years in my early twenties I made quite a lot of my ownclothes.  I was very small back then andcould rarely find things to fit me, other than children’s clothes.  From making my own clothes I then had a go atmaking curtains, which at the time I probably thought were the bees-knees, butwhich now I would be embarrassed to own.When I was expecting my first child, I made nearly all myown maternity dresses as well as baby clothes. I even made babygros.  Does anyonedo that these days?But back to the knitting! By the time I had my two sons, I was an obsessive knitter and was alwaysknitting little jumpers for them.  Here’ssomething I knitted almost thirty years ago …Friendsfrequently admired what Edward and Samuel wore and started to ask me to knitfor their children.  Which I did.  I then bought a knitting machine to keep upwith the requests, and the hobby took off in a completely new direction with memaking sweaters to sell at craft fairs, which was great fun.  Here’s an example of one of my own designs inan adult size … Butthen life changed and while I was living in Brussels I decided I would try myhand at a new hobby … I would write a novel, and look where that lead!How often do you knit and how easy is it to find the time?These days, after quite a long time of not touching aknitting needle, I knit almost every evening while watching thetelevision.  I find I don’t know what todo with my hands unless I have a pair of needles in them and a ball of wool atmy side. Do you do any other arts and crafts?During the years when I was ‘on a break’ from knitting, Itook up needlepoint, which is wonderfully relaxing, a bit like painting bynumbers.Here’s a cushion I made. Although I would have to be honest and admit that I gave the finishedcanvas to a professional upholsterer to turn into the finished cushion – mysewing skills would not have done it justice. A couple of years ago a writer friend, Adele Geras, tried toteach me how to crochet, but it was my daughter-in-law who really got me goingwith making granny squares.  Once I hadthat technique under my belt, I started making throws.  Here’s one I made and which I’m particularlyfond of …Do you think knitting (or the time you spend knitting) helpswith your writing and overall wellbeing?  Oh yes, without a doubt. When I’m knitting, crocheting or doing needlepoint, my brain switchesinto a more relaxed mode and all sorts of ideas pop into my head, often thesolution to a tricky plot situation. There have been surveys carried out recently that suggest knitting isgenuinely good for our wellbeing, mentally and physically.What have you knitted recently?I now have a grandson and have made him a couple ofsweaters, but this is my most recent creation for me to wear, which took aboutthree months to knit, by hand – I got rid of the knitting machine a very longago.  While watching The Crown on NetflixI came up with the Fair Isle design – one eye on the television, the other onthe pad of graph paper on my lap and selection of coloured pencils.  For those who like to know these things, Iused Rowan merino 4 ply for the cream background and a mix of other 4 plybrands for the additional colours.THANKS FOR TAKING PART, ERICA!About ERICA JAMESErica James is the author of many bestselling novels, including GARDENS OFDELIGHT, which won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award, and her recent SundayTimes top ten bestsellers, SONG OF THE SKYLARK and SUMMER AT THE LAKE.

AUTHORSFor me, mylove of books and the wonderful journey into the depths of my imagination beganwith Enid Blyton. A few years on, I immersed myself into the stories of AgathaChristie. I loved not only the mystery, the ‘who dunnit,’ but the use of often flamboyant,fragrant characters to steal the show. Glamorous settings, elegant characters adornedin period attire leading the way.... FILMS/MOVIESDifficultto name one. I love emotional films, those that leave me with a feeling forsome time after. But a film I still talk about is Silence of the Lambs. There is something so chilling about seeingAnthony Hopkins in that infamous face mask, yet I still quite like somethingabout him. For a feel good film, maybe – LoveActually.... TV DRAMASThere havebeen a few just lately that have kept me salivating for next episode. But, forthe overall feeling, I loved - Brokenby Jimmy McGovern with Sean Bean. I thought this was something special. Itincorporated everything about life, sad, funny, dark and light with somewonderful acting too. I cried, I laughed, I sat on the edge of my seat.... FICTIONAL KILLERSIt has tobe Hannibal Lecter. How can anyone capable of such atrocities still manage tokeep me searching for what I like about him? He captures that psychopathictrait, of killing for good reason without conscience, without responsibility sobrilliantly. Chilling, yet eloquently charming.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES It has tobe Sherlock Holmes. Again such a complex character, rude, egotistical,incredibly sharp and witty all in one spoken sentence.... MURDER WEAPONSRoald Dahl,A Lamb to the Slaughter. Where thewife kills her husband with a leg of lamb which she later feeds to appreciative,investigating detectives. Clever woman!    ... DEATH SCENESProbablyone of the worst death scenes for me is when Hannibal Lecter removes the facefrom his guard to use as his own disguise. Before suspending him from the ceiling.It’s fair to say, that one stayed with me for quite a while.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI waslaughing to myself the other day, wondering what anyone would think if theytook a saunter through my browser history… how best to kill yourself quickly?How does it feel to drown? Which emojis will help me find a weed dealer? I alsosearch back through old newspaper articles, across the world. And of course,behavioural psychology research papers.... WRITING TIPSI am not aplanner. I have tried to be but it doesn’t work for me. It only prevents mymind from ticking over. I also make lots of notes that I never return to orrefer to. I use them only to sew a seed, then I let the story tell me how andwhere it wants to go. So – do whatever works best for you, we all workdifferently and like many things in life, there is no right way to write....

The Fear was published by Avon on 22 March 2018.The FearBy Cally TaylorPublished by Avon (22 March 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionSometimes your first love won’t let you go…When Lou Wandsworth ran away to France with her teacher MikeHughes, she thought he was the love of her life. But Mike wasn’t what he seemedand he left her life in pieces.Now 32, Lou discovers that he is involved with teenager ChloeMeadows. Determined to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself, she returnshome to confront him for the damage he’s caused.But Mike is a predator of the worst kind, and as Lou tries tobring him to justice, it’s clear that she could once again become his prey…My verdictThe Fear is a very dark read, covering strong themes such as grooming, child abuse and revenge. It's definitely CL Taylor's darkest book yet and the well-drawn characters certainly got under my skin.This is the story of Mike Hughes, a martial arts instructor, who groomed a young teenager, Lou, and then ran away with her to France. Eighteen years on, Lou has finally returned to her childhood home, planning to confront her past so that she can finally put it behind her. She's hoping that after his spell in prison, Mike has changed. But instead, she discovers he is up to his old tricks again, this time with a young teenage girl called Chloe. Lou tries to steer clear but realises she needs to protect Chloe and stop Mike destroying another young girl's life.The story is narrated by Lou, Chloe and a mysterious woman called Wendy. I guessed some twists early on, but they didn't detract from my enjoyment, and I certainly didn't predict some of the later events (see below). I assume the book was originally set in the present day and then the whole timeline was shifted back 10 years, without changing some of the factual content, such as references to modern social media. But again, this didn't detract from the plot and, after a while, I stopped 'Googling' everything to make sure I wasn't going mad.The Fear is a fast-paced thriller and very easy to gobble up in one sitting. It features some graphic scenes and disturbing content, but these are handled with sensitivity. I'm reluctant to call the book 'entertaining' due to the topics it covers - 'compelling' and 'addictive' may be more appropriate words to use - but there were certainly some highly memorable, totally crazy and perhaps a little far-fetched scenes towards the end.If you like twisty psychological thrillers, with strong characters and an unpredictable plot, and don't mind difficult subject matter, then add The Fear to your shopping list.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Beautiful Liars is being published by Trapeze on 19 April 2018.Beautiful LiarsBy Isabel AshdownPublished by Trapeze (19 April 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalleyPublisher's descriptionEighteen years ago Martha said goodbye to best friend Julieton a moonlit London towpath.The next morning Juliet's bike was found abandoned at the waterside.She was never seen again.Nearly two decades later Martha is a TV celebrity, preparingto host a new crime show... and the first case will be that of missing studentJuliet Sherman. After all these years Martha must reach out to old friends andtry to piece together the final moments of Juliet's life.But what happens when your perfect friends turn out to beperfect strangers...?My verdictI loved Beautiful Liars. This is a chilling read filled with secrets of the past, the dark side of teenage friendships, distorted memories and ultimate betrayal.The narrative alternates between Martha and Casey. Martha, TV host of a new true crime show, is looking into the disappearance of her childhood friend, Juliet. She has a compelling voice - most of her story is in the present day, but it's dotted with memories containing snippets of the past - revealing that there's a lot bubbling under the surface as the story develops. Casey also has a very distinctive voice. She's sad and lonely, renting the house of Martha & Juliet's other friend, Liv. When she reads a letter from Martha to Liv about the search for Juliet, she's determined to help - or maybe hinder - the investigation.Beautiful Liars made me gasp in several places, as it's cleverly plotted and suitably twisty, and its tangled web of lies certainly played with my mind. The strong distinctive characters felt very real - all were unreliable and well-drawn - and the setting was very well described.This unpredictable read left me with a chilling sensation and saying 'ooh' under my breath. Highly recommended for psychological thriller fans.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Hiding a dark secret, she takes greater risks tofind new evidence and infiltrate the group. As Starke and Bell get closer to cracking the case neither ofthem realise they're being watched. The killer is closer to them than theythink, and he has his next victim - Clementine - firmly in his sights.My verdictMy Little Eye is a crime thriller with a fresh take on the police procedural. I loved the premise of this book - the idea of a group of amateurs taking on the police to solve a murder.Young women are found dead in their bedrooms surrounded by flowers and the police are struggling to crack the case. Clementine Starke is drawn to an online true crime group of people determined to beat the police investigation and find the killer first. She's a complex character - damaged and vulnerable, hiding away from the world, ashamed of her past and distrustful of the police, yet with an inner strength that emerges as the book progresses. DI Dominic Bell, in charge of the police investigation, is also hiding secrets and is running out of time while he's being distracted by an internal investigation.The book reads well, with authentic characters and a compelling plot, turning into a race against the clock for everyone involved. It's dark and twisty and a great introduction to a new crime series. I loved the innovative ways in which the true crime group set out to solve the case without the backing of police resources. As expected, most of their interactions take place online, in private messages, group chats and online forums, revealing more about their personalities and personal agendas.I'll be interested to see how the Starke and Bell series develops, as both central characters have intriguing back stories and there's clearly some chemistry between them. They make perfect adversaries but also a perfect match - which will it be?Follow the Blog Tour"},

{"title": "The Good Doctor of Warsaw by Elisabeth Gifford", "date": "Tuesday 10 April 2018", "text": "On Wednesday evening, I will be at a local Synagogue for an evening of remembrance to commemorate Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day), which takes place from Wednesday evening to Thursday evening. There, I will hear poems read out by teenagers, a testimonial from a Holocaust survivor, a speech by two nuns from the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary (which was originally founded in Germany and supports Holocaust survivors) and light candles for named Holocaust victims. Today on Off-the-Shelf Books, I have my review of The Good Doctor of Warsaw by Elizabeth Gifford. The Good Doctor of WarsawBy Elizabeth GiffordPublished by Corvus (1 February 2018)Publisher's description'You do not leave a sick child alone to face the dark and youdo not leave a child at a time like this.'Deeply in love and about to marry, students Misha and Sophiaflee a Warsaw under Nazi occupation for a chance at freedom. Forced to returnto the Warsaw ghetto, they help Misha's mentor, Dr Korczak, care for the twohundred children in his orphanage. As Korczak struggles to uphold the rights ofeven the smallest child in the face of unimaginable conditions, he becomes abeacon of hope for the thousands who live behind the walls.As the noose tightens around the ghetto Misha and Sophia aretorn from one another, forcing them to face their worst fears alone. They canonly hope to find each other again one day...Meanwhile, refusing to leave the children unprotected,Korczak must confront a terrible darkness.Half a million people lived in the Warsaw ghetto. Less thanone percent survived to tell their story. This novel is based on the trueaccounts of Misha and Sophia, and on the life of one of Poland's greatest men,Dr Janusz Korczak. My verdictI had already heard of Dr Janusz Korczak before I read The Good Doctor of Warsaw, having seen a brief mention of him in the book (and film) The Zookeeper's Wife by Diane Ackerman. My eldest son visited Poland earlier this year and learnt more about his orphanage, visiting some key Holocaust locations in and around Warsaw. But while I knew a little about his story, The Good Doctor of Warsaw really brought him and the children he cared for to life.This is a true story written like fiction, in easy-to-read prose and dialogue, yet I can't describe this as an 'easy read.' It's a powerful book - traumatic and heartbreaking in places, yet also uplifting and hopeful in others. A love story, not just between Misha and Sophia, but also between Dr Korczak and the children that he refused to abandon. Dr Korczak may not have been their biological father, but he treated all of them as his own, putting his own life at risk while trying to keep them safe and protecting them from the horrors of the Holocaust, right until the bitter end.The book begins before the war, providing a calm and happy contrast to the rising tension and growing fear of the Jewish community, and then the creation of the Warsaw ghetto. The book is realistic and well-researched. The descriptions of Warsaw and the ghetto are difficult to read at times, but such an important part of the reading experience, understanding the despair and horrors felt by all of the people who lived there.The Good Doctor of Warsaw is an important book, one that needs to be read - not just to remind us how quickly prejudice can escalate into genocide, but also as a legacy for the future. We are currently living through a period when holocaust denial and antisemitism are on the rise once more in Europe, and within the UK itself, reminding many people of 1930s Germany.Reading this book (and similar books) will ensure that we (and future generations) will never forget the worst of humanity and how easy it is to turn a blind eye."},
{"title": "Music and Writing by Kjell Ola Dahl - Blog Tour", "date": "Monday 9 April 2018", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Kjell Ola Dahl to my blog today for his The Ice Swimmer blog tour, to talk about 'music and writing'. The Ice Swimmer is being published in paperback by Orenda Books on 30 April 2018. Music and WritingBy Kjell Ola DahlFor me, music and writing are intrinsicallylinked. I always think an interesting question toask about one of the characters you’ve created as a writer is whether their tastein music tells you something about them. We all have prejudices about taste. Youmight hate some specific piece of music; you meet a person who says she loves it,and you think she’s a moron (or you do if you’re like me). Afterwards, though,you and the same person might have an interesting discussion about the latestbook you’ve both read. Now she’s suddenly an interesting person – someone whoseintelligence and taste you respect. Music and writing therefore goes many ways– making you despise and adore the same person. Gunnarstranda, a police officer in my OsloDetectives series, has an obsession with Miles Davis. I don’t have the samestrong affinity as he does to Miles’s music, though. I can relax to recordslike Kind of Blue, In a Silent Way or Milestones, but I can never bear to listen to the whole of Bitches Brew, for example. Gunnarstrandacan though, and I think this obsession reveals an aspect of his personality. Helikes to follow the trumpet’s lead through the strange world of beats it’splayed against. I think he is intrigued by complex things and has an innatepatience, and this is reflected both in his taste in music and the way he conducthis police work. Musical taste also tell us something aboutthe protagonist of The Ice Swimmer,Lena. She likes Tom Waits and female singers such as Sade. These are two verydiffernet types of artists – one of them rough and experimental and the othersmooth and easy to listen to. I think Lena is the type of person who uses musicto reflect different feelings and states of mind. One reader wrote this to me about The Ice Swimmer: ‘I loved the book, butdidn’t like Lena's taste in music and films.’ I like this comment very much because it showsthat the reader has been with my character all the way, but still, after they’vefinished the book, they have a sort of unbalanced feeling about theprotagonist. Lena is therefore still in their mind. Music provokes all our emotions: it influencesyour heartbeat and your blood pressure. Your pulse and hearbeat will sometimesadapt to the beat of the music you’re listening to. No wonder music can beinspirational. I am often inspired by music when I write;after all, writing is all about emotions. If I am listening to music I likevery much, my thoughts starts wandering and suddenly an extrodinarily good ideapops into my mind and I have to start writing immediately. A few moments laterI don’t hear the music anymore and I’m just concentrating on the writing. At othertimes I have to turn the same music off, so that I can concentrate. That is abad sign. When I turn the music off, I know that the idea was not as good as Ithought it was in the first place – and I know I will throw the text away later.Other times the opposite happens: I hearsome good music; I’m inspired, start writing and suddenly the music makes the ideasaccelerate. I cannot write fast enough. It’s like a sprint. I’m exhausted, but Icannot stop, because if I do, that magic grip will let go and then I will loseeverything. But later, when I polish the same text, I can do it perfectlywithout listening to anything. I can concentrate hard on the words and sentencesand they survive the trash bin.Writing is hard work – with or withoutmusic. But for me music feeds my creativity.About Kjell Ola DahlOne of thegodfathers of the Nordic Noir genre, Kjell Ola Dahl was born in 1958 in Gjøvik.He made his debut in 1993, and has since published eleven novels, the mostprominent of which is a series of police procedurals cum psychologicalthrillers featuring investigators Gunnarstranda and Frølich.

DI Maya Rahman is struggling to investigate, as many of the locals seem reluctant to help and there's a lot of tension bubbling under the surface within the community.Author Vicky Newham has constructed a multi-layered and complex plot, with realistic characters and believable dialogue. She feeds titbits of information throughout her book, providing enough intrigue to keep her plot moving along steadily, but not so fast that you can't take it all in. There are twists, turns and surprises right until the end.Turn A Blind Eye brings the East End of London to life, with a great sense of place and an emphasis on location. The book highlights local community spirit, cultural diversity and work ethic, and also isn't afraid to touch on racial tension, cultural clashes and educational issues. It felt fresh and authentic and in keeping with modern times.I felt that I got to know DI Maya Rahman and her team well, yet the book left enough mystery for me to want to know more. I definitely want to read more Maya Rahman books.This is a fantastic debut and a very promising start to what will hopefully be a great series."},

{"title": "The diversity of diversity...", "date": "Monday 26 March 2018", "text": "... and why it can be a challenge to please everyone (plus a bit more about the book I’m writing).This post of mine is based on a comment I made in a Facebook group (for bloggers and authors) in February 2018. We were discussing Lionel Shriver’s article in The Guardian (you can read the Guardian article here), which raised many questions within the group:Should we only write about the life we know?Or should we feel comfortable writing about a life we don’t know?Should we write about topics we haven’t experienced - and may never experience?Or should we only write about topics we have experienced?I'm writing Jewish-themed crime fiction. I've never committed a murder (you'll be pleased to know), but I do keep many of the Jewish traditions and live in a Jewish area, so to some degree I am writing about what I know. Yet this doesn't make writing a novel any easier. I still need engaging characters, a great plot and a believable setting (and I'm working hard on those, if anyone's interested). It also brings up other challenges for me, as I'm explaining concepts and practices I take for granted to people who know nothing (or very little) about the religion. I'm not ready to share any details about my plot, but my main character is a journalist who is learning about the religion as she investigates some possible crimes - which helps to take the reader on a journey of discovery too.Many people show interest when I tell them what I'm writing. Comments include:'Jewish-themed crime fiction is definitely something different.''I don't know much about Judaism so would love to learn more.''Get on and write it - I can't wait to read it.'Judaism in the UKJews make up only 0.5% of the UK's religious groups - below Christians, those with no religion, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs in the chart. This often surprises people when I tell them this, as Jews seem so prominent within society and we are not considered by many to be an ethnic or religious 'minority group'. Many people tell me they've never met anyone Jewish before - yet, how would they know, as we look and behave like everyone else. Ignorance breeds antisemitism and racism - this is something that needs to be addressed and one of the reasons I'm writing this book. My book begins with an antisemitic attack by two teenagers against a Jewish woman. Most people don't realise how much antisemitism occurs in the UK and that it is on the rise, as the incidents often don't make the national news. According to the Campaign Against Antisemitism, one in three British Jews has considered leaving Britain in the past two years due to antisemitism, with concern mounting over failures to tackle antisemitic crime and antisemitism in politics. Universities throughout the country are now a breeding ground for anti-Israel and antisemitic behaviour. According to the Community Security Trust, there were 1,382 antisemitic incidents recorded nationwide in 2017 - a record level inthe UK.Diversity within JudaismThe Facebook group discussion moved on to the concept of diversity and whether it's possible to write books that appeal to diverse readers if you're not part of that group yourself. My point was that it will always be difficult to please everyone but you do have to make sure your book is well researched - and others in the discussion agreed.Just as there is diversity in the country as a whole, there is diversity within all communities and there isn't (or shouldn't be) such thing as a stereotype. The Jewish population in the UK is an example of this. You have the ultra-religious communities, who may dress and behave in a particular way (and are most easily identified as being Jewish). You may see them in parts of London, Greater London and Manchester, for example. Then you have the non-observant Jews, who don't keep any of the traditions, but are still Jewish because it's in their blood and are proud of their Jewish heritage. And then you have everyone else in between.My book is set in a fictional town based on where I live, with some more observant Jewish families and some who keep very little of their religion but still identify themselves as being Jewish. Despite living in a fairly Jewish area, many people around here (including us) have experienced antisemitism (some openly, some disguised and some completely shocking).Next weekend, it is the Jewish festival of Pesach (Passover), which is one of the most commonly observed festivals, even by many people who are otherwise normally non-observant. But as with all diverse groups, everyone keeps the festival in their own way - so I'll use this as an example. It's one reason why I've been busy recently and will be for another couple of weeks.Some Jewish people observe all of the 'rules' and others observe very few - and some in between. Even where I live, members of our Synagogue observe it in different ways, at different levels of religiosity. This is a clear example of diversity within one Jewish community.What is Pesach?Pesach, which lasts for eight days, commemorates the exodus of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The name Pesach (Passover) comes from the miracle when God passed over the houses of the Israelites during the 10th plague  - 'Death of the First Born'. The festival has many different features. It's too complicated to explain in detail, but here's a relatively short summary:1. We eat special foods. We eat matzah (unleavened bread) rather than bread, reminding us that the Israelites didn't have time to let their bread rise when they left Egypt in a hurry. Matzah is made from flour and water and cooked very quickly. It's flat, like a cracker. I can't say I'm a great fan of it - I think of it as edible cardboard - but other people (including my husband and Dad) like it! Pesach is more complicated than just eating Matzah though, as all of our food (other than fruit, vegetables, meat/poultry and fish) has to be specially made for Pesach - even down to cooking oil, tins of tuna, dairy foods, crisps and chocolate (no Easter eggs!) - to ensure it hasn't been in contact with bread and chametz - see point 2). Some people will just avoid bread and eat matzah during Pesach but won't change any of the other foods they eat. Everyone keeps Pesach in a way that suits them.2. We prepare for Pesach with the ultimate spring clean. We clear our house of bread and other foods (known as chametz - pronounce the 'ch' as in the Scottish 'loch') before Pesach begins. During Pesach, we can't eat pasta, rice, barley and legumes. We use different crockery, cutlery, pots and pans for those eight days, sealing up our kitchen cupboards (so we don't use our 'normal' items) or swapping them around (our Pesach items are stored in boxes in our garage and loft during the rest of the year). We cover all the kitchen surfaces. It's a bit like moving house (or at least, kitchen), with all the preparations beforehand. And yes, it can be stressful (okay, a nightmare).3. We have a special family meal on the first two nights. It's called a Seder, which means 'order', because the meal has a special order that we follow, with specific traditional foods (such as parsley dipped in salt water to symbolise tears shed in slavery and raw horseradish to symbolise the bitterness of slavery). The Seder details, and the story of Pesach, are written in a special book called a Haggadah. Some families only do one Seder on the first night - we do both nights.During the Seder, we sing songs and have discussions. Frogs may be dotted around the table (not real ones, I should add) - as frogs feature in the second plague.Last year, we had the parting of the Red Sea down the centre of our Seder table - thanks to blue crepe paper, sand-coloured felt, fish stickers, shell-shaped sequins and Playmobil figures (Egyptians and builders etc). I think I enjoyed making it far more than my teenagers enjoyed seeing it. We even have a big Playmobil pyramid stored in the loft from when my boys were younger.Pesach has many different themes and we do try to relate them to the 'here and now'. One of these is the theme of modern slavery (and not just the obvious - think about how enslaved we are to technology and social media). Then there's the theme of refugee status - as currently seen in Syria. Then finally the theme of antisemitism, which returns to my book. Just as the Jews were persecuted by Pharaoh then, they have been persecuted ever since, with the Holocaust and modern day antisemitic attacks.So should we be free to write about lives different to our own?I know that if I do get my novel published, it may come under a lot of scrutiny and I may be more open to antisemitism - I've already experienced antisemitic behaviour on social media, in response to a tweet about Holocaust Remembrance Day. Yes, this does worry me, but I know that I'll rise above it and have a strong support network of people around me.But I may not only attract criticism from the wider population, and in some ways this worries me more, turning writing this book into more of a challenge to get it right. As already mentioned above, the Jewish community is diverse. So my personal experience of Judaism probably won't be the same as someone else's. The Jewish characters in my book are also diverse, from a Jewish community like my own.Some Jewish people may disagree with the content of my book if it's ever 'out there', because it's too Jewish, not Jewish enough, tells too much, tells too little, 'we don't do it like that', gives us a bad name... and 'you can't have anyone Jewish committing a crime'. Others may say it's great as it highlights antisemitism, shows that we're like everyone else, raises awareness of Judaism etc - which is exactly what I'm trying to do.I don't think there's any way to 'win' in terms of writing about diverse groups of people, even if we're part of the community ourselves. When we read books, they touch us in many different ways, based on our nature and nurture, our upbringing, our past experiences, our present situation. No two readers will read a book in the same way or respond to it in the same way.And that’s the beauty of reading - and writing.Ultimately, we should be free to write (and read) about what excites us, what motivates us, what challenges us and what drives us.For me, it's crime fiction with a Jewish theme. Watch this space!"},

They never dreamed they would find Louise: aquiet, polite and devoted woman who sings to their children, cleans thefamily's chic apartment in Paris's upscale tenth arrondissement, stays latewithout complaint and is able to host enviable birthday parties.The couple and nanny become more dependent on each other.But as jealousy, resentment and suspicions increase, Myriam and Paul's idyllictableau is shattered...My verdictI had read a lot of mixed views about Lullaby on social media before I started reading it. This is certainly a book that provokes a lot of discussion. I dived in without reading the blurb or any other reviews, determined to read it with an open mind.Lullaby is an uncomfortable read about an ambitious couple's fragile relationship with their seemingly-perfect nanny. Myriam and Paul rely on Louise to not only look after their young children but also to keep their whole household flowing smoothly. Louise relies on them for her wages. She makes herself indispensable to make sure the family are unlikely to ever let her go - after all, how would they cope without her?Yet despite spending so much time together, there is a distance between the adults - fuelled by the class divide, poverty versus privilege and the 'us and them' approach. You know from the start that there's no happy ending. In fact quite the opposite. But what makes a conscientious nanny turn on the children in her care?Lullaby is a short book at only 207 pages but packs a serious punch with its taut sparse prose. The translation is brilliant and the writing flows so smoothly that I found myself reading passages out loud to myself, savouring the natural rhythm of the words. Yet while the style is chatty, the narrative is distanced from the characters, as if the reader is watching their lives through a camera lens. This creates a chilling, disturbing account of a household in crisis, spiralling all the way to disaster.Lullaby plays on parents' darkest fears and I felt that it read like 'true crime/non-fiction' in places, making it seem very real. The book left me cold, with so many thoughts bounding around in my head and goosebumps up my arms.Did I enjoy it? Yes, even though I don't feel I should have enjoyed it at all, due to the subject matter. Would I recommend it? Definitely. But maybe not to stressed working parents who rely heavily on their nanny."},

It’s technically supernatural horror (I had toGoogle the genre to be sure!) but it startswith a crime and this film brilliantly demonstrates precisely what I like my‘crime stories’ to do. Namely…the totally unexpected.  I love a story that widens the lens to exploresurprising motive and consequence. The Sixth Sense is pure character-led genius– managing to deliver big shocks as well as deeply touching scenes. It’s alsothe scariest movie I have managed to watch without passing out.

I then moved to asix-month position as editorial assistant for Poetry. I chained myself to mydesk and (as we all know, possession is 9/10ths of the law) was eventually madepermanent, working across the poetry, fiction and non-fiction lists beforespecialising in crime fiction.

In February 2017, I was promoted toEditorial Director. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?So many good books!! I’m working on a lot of books at themoment, all of which I’m excited about, but I guess to just mention three thatare coming up over the summer months: KissMe, Kill Me by J. S. Carol – an incredibly tense psychological thriller; The Old Religion by Martyn Waites, whichI’m pitching as ‘Peter May meets TheWicker Man’; Killing It by AsiaMackay – a brilliant book about a female assassin who has just had her firstchild and is now back at work – she puts the ‘sass’ back in ‘assassin’ (attrib.

There's just one catch – chiselled into the cavewall above the body is an image of the grim reaper and the dead man's initials,and it's been there for over a century.A DEADLY GAME As Meg battles to solve the increasingly disturbing case,it's clear someone knows her secrets. The murderer is playing games with Meg –and the dice are loaded…My verdictOn starting The Devil's Dice, I thought the book was going to be a straightforward police procedural. But this is no ordinary case and certainly stands out from the crowd. It involves supernatural curses and the mysterious death of a lawyer, found in a Peak District cave.DI Meg Dalton is a strong feisty protagonist with lots of attitude. A risk-taker prone to injury and with plenty of flaws, she definitely doesn't play by the rules. And this often gets her into trouble with her superiors and colleagues. As Meg tries to solve the case, everything begins to feel a little too personal, bringing back memories of tragedy in her own family's past.The Devil's Dice is a very twisty mystery with plenty of cliffhangers, particularly in the last 100 or so pages. I read the final chapters in one sitting, barely moving, and found myself holding my breath as everything was revealed through several action-packed scenes in a very chilling setting.Overall, I thought The Devil's Dice was fun and easy to read, with a clever thought-provoking plot. I'm looking forward to the next Meg Dalton book."},

I have a lovelyview over the Common and see sparrow hawks, kestrels, rabbits, dog walkers andeven deer. I keep my handbags in my room, and I often have company in the formof one of my dogs, Reggie, who likes to sleep on the futon (I know, I know, whoon earth buys something as uncomfortable as a futon?). Sometimes *whispers* I curlup with him. WalkingAnd talking of Reggie, walking him and Bella is a wonderfulway to clear my head, untangle plot messes, think about characters and feelthat maybe what I’m writing isn’t one hundred percent c***p. I often go up theroad to a wonderful area where the dogs run free to sniff and smell and play.The East Anglian sky is wide and beautiful and the sense of space is amazing.The dogs are also very good sounding boards as they always seem pleased to hearabout my plots, characters, and so on. They never get bored! Marvellous! RadioI have to have silence while I work, but when I want toswitch off I love listening to the radio, usually plays I have downloaded fromthe BBC - Radio Four or Radio Four Extra. I have heard some great stuff overthe years, and I particularly like plays that use the medium of radio to itsfullest - a recent Jonathan Myerson play was a brilliant example of this. If Ican’t sleep at night I listen to Radio Five Live Up All Night, which is full ofinteresting and informative items, so not great for getting me off to sleep. Iam also an out and proud fan of The Archers.... NotebooksNotebooks, notebooks and more notebooks! Of all shapes andsizes! But mostly I like to write in big ones, at least A4 size.... I make notes,write character outlines, doodle, and often write down what has happened so farin the latest book I’m writing - I find if I do that a couple of times it canunlock the next bit... HusbandCouldn’t do any of this without him. Simple. He is encouraging,he doesn’t yawn when I bore on. And on. And on.

Now you can spend therest of eternity re-living your happiest memories: that first kiss, falling inlove, the birth of your children, enjoyed on loop for ever and ever.Isobel isa Heaven Architect, and she helps dying people create afterlives from thesememories. So when she falls for Jarek,one of her terminal - and married - clients, she knows that while she cannotsave him, she can create the most beautiful of heavens, just for him.But when Jarek's wife is found dead, Isobel uncovers a darkerside of the world she works within, and she can trust no one with what shefinds...My verdictThe Memory Chamber is an innovative combination of science, murder-mystery and thriller set in an alternative world that's not that different from our own.It features an interesting and thought-provoking concept - the creation of an artificial afterlife. Following the extraction of certain cells after death, clients can exist within their selected memories forever, inside a heaven that's been tailor-made just for them. The controversial technology is mainly for those who can afford it and choose to have one, but it isn't just for the wealthy. There's a global war going on, and soldiers are able to plan their own heavens, and contemplate their own deaths, before they head to the frontline.Heaven Architect Isobel combines her knowledge of science and creativity to create amazing heavens for her clients, discussing their needs in advance. She's dedicated to her job, but breaks her professional and ethical code when she falls for a terminally ill married client, Jarek, who becomes a prime suspect in a murder investigation after his death. If Jarek is guilty of murder, his cells will be destroyed, which means he won't live forever in the heaven Isobel created just for him. So she agrees to explore his memories inside his heaven for clues that will prove he wasn't the killer. But that science is still untested, and soon Isobel no longer knows who she can trust.I raced through The Memory Chamber. It kept me on the edge of my seat, with twists and turns, suspense and thrills, and some tender moments too. With a background in science writing, Holly Cave has explained the scientific concepts well. It all seemed very believable, as she has also explored the ethical and legal issues involved.The Memory Chamber is a book that will make you question and think - a perfect book club read. Would you want to exist in your own tailor-made afterlife or would you prefer oblivion? Would you want to be part of someone else's afterlife, even if you know little about them? And which of your own memories would you choose to remember for eternity?"},

We Were the Salt of the Sea is published in paperback by Orenda Books on 20 March 2018.Read on for my review:We Were the Salt of the SeaBy Roxanne BouchardTranslated by David WarrinerPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - out now; Paperback - 30 March 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionAs Montrealer Catherine Daysets foot in a remote fishing village and starts asking around about her birthmother, the body of a woman dredges up in a fisherman’s nets. Not just anywoman, though: Marie Garant, an elusive, nomadic sailor and unbridled beautywho once tied many a man’s heart in knots. Detective Sergeant Joaquin Morales,newly drafted to the area from the suburbs of Montreal, barely has time tounpack his suitcase before he’s thrown into the deep end of the investigation.On Quebec’s outlying Gaspé Peninsula, the truth can be slippery, especiallydown on the fishermen’s wharves. Interviews drift into idle chit-chat, evidencefloats off with the tide and the truth lingers in murky waters. It’s enough tomake DS Morales reach straight for a large whisky…  My verdictWe Were the Salt of the Sea is a character-led literary crime novel set in a remote Quebec setting.When the body of nomadic and mysterious Marie Garant is discovered tangled in a fishing net, it's up to newly located Detective Joaquin Morales to decide whether she drowned or whether her death was more sinister. Meanwhile Catherine Day, a young woman from Montreal, is visiting the remote fishing village to search for her birth mother. It doesn't take too long before their paths collide.The book is well translated by David Warriner, and beautifully written with exquisite prose and well-observed descriptions. The small cast of varied characters and the remote setting give the book a claustrophobic feel. Each character has their own quirk that is apparent in their appearance, mannerisms and dialogue, creating a novel with a uniqueness that will be hard to forget.We Were the Salt of the Sea is more than just an investigation into a woman's death. It's a story of a woman's search for the truth about her birth parents, trying to explore secrets from her past. It's also a detective's journey, discovering more about himself, his marriage and human behaviour. An emotional journey for both of them, with a focus on identity and a sense of belonging.But most of all, this book is about the sea - its uncertainty and unpredictability, its rawness and beauty. The vivid descriptions left me with a yearning to visit Canada (again) and experience the natural beauty of Quebec's coastline for myself.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Five faces stare back at you.One of them is your husband.My verdictNeed to Know totally sucked me in and kept me hostage for a few hours!This was a one-sitting read with my heart pounding as I held my breath and turned the pages as fast as my brain could process the words on them. I could see why other people who read this book before me had been raving about it. I couldn't put it down!Need to Know is a story of espionage but also a marriage in crisis. Vivian, a CIA counterintelligence analyst, discovers that her husband isn't who she thinks he is, which could not only affect their relationship but, perhaps more worryingly, also national security. Is their relationship built on lies and manipulation? Is it real or not? And should she reveal the truth to her superiors and colleagues?This is the type of book that will keep you reading late into the night or even the early hours of the morning. I admit that I had to suspend belief more than a little, but I didn't care. This is a fast-paced page turner, with tension on every page and an impressive, additive plot. It's a light, easy read - perfect escapism from the real world. It's fun and different with great writing. And I did find myself wondering what I would have done in Vivian's situation.I can see why this book was highly sought after, and also why it's been picked up by Hollywood. It's mind-blowing and highly entertaining from start to finish, and shockingly twisty - a book written for the big screen. I'm really hoping there's a sequel!"},
{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Sam Humphreys", "date": "Monday 12 March 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome SAM HUMPHREYSAssociate PublisheratMantle (imprint of Pan Macmillan)What and when was your first job in publishing?I actually started as a temporary editorial secretary, atPan Macmillan, in 2002. I’d done a couple of weeks’ work experience and aneditorial assistant left. There was a recruitment freeze at the time, so I wastaken on as a temp, working across the commercial fiction and Picador lists,and, at some point, made permanent. When my original boss left, my new bosschanged my job title to editorial assistant, as that was essentially the jobI’d been doing anyway. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve been at Mantle, with Maria (Rejt, Publisher) and Josie (Humber,Assistant Editor) since September 2014, and have been gradually building mylist since then. I now have about 15 authors. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I only publish fiction, and have mainly acquired debuts.Last year, I published the paperback of a book called Miss You by Kate Eberlen, which was a Richard & Judy pick. Iseem to be publishing lots of books this year, including Only Child by Rhiannon Navin (March) and The Man Who Didn’t Call by Rosie Walsh (June), to name but two(which feels a bit like only mentioning two children when you’ve got a wholehouseful!)…  Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I was a primary school teacher before I worked in publishingand I definitely think the skills I acquired as a teacher have stood me in goodstead. I also firmly believe that the only real experience you need to becomean editor is being a(n avid) reader: if you read, you can pick the good stories(and story tellers!) and you can edit. I don’t have an English literaturedegree and I don’t think it’s ever held me back.How do you relax after a busy working day?Probably a nice meal and a glass of wine – or two… I tend tospend my evenings reading submissions, but that’s not exactly strenuous. What was the last book you read for pleasure?Joanna Cannon’s THREE THINGS ABOUT ELSIE; I loved THE TROUBLE WITH GOATS AND SHEEP,so was really looking forward to this– and I certainly wasn’t disappointed. Describe your job in 15 words or less...I actually have no idea what I do! I publish books –whatever that means – and champion them where-ever and however possible. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farI was lucky enough to publish Emma Donoghue’s Room, which was an amazing experience,from winning the auction for it, to meeting and working with Emma, to the mediaresponse to the book, to the Booker dinner and beyond. It was especially lovelybecause it wasn’t Emma’s first novel, and it’s always heartening to be remindedthat authors can become hugely successful (Emma had been critically successfulpreviously, but not commercially so – or at least, not in comparison to Room) at any stage of their career. But thereare many other highlights too. When I was first working at Pan Macmillan(possibly while I was still a temp), I can remember coming into the office onemorning, and I had a voicemail message from Don DeLillo, saying he liked thecover for his latest book, which I’d just sent him… That was definitely a highpoint. As was getting to travel to both India and China for work. (I lookedafter both Picador India and Picador Asia for a while.) And there’s nothingquite like the feeling you get when you read a submission and you absolutelylove it… If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I always used to say that my plan b, if ever publishingfailed, would be dog walking – but perhaps somewhere warm and sunny rather thanthe UK. Or else teaching in a commune in San Francisco. Failing that, I thinkI’d make a great receptionist in a GP surgery. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?The Never-Ending Story– because it’s not over yet, and also, because I’m a fiction editor, mypublishing life has been all aboutstories… Thanks so much for taking part, Sam!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "Sunburn by Laura Lippman: an extract", "date": "Friday 9 March 2018", "text": "I'm delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for Sunburn by Laura Lippman. Sunburn was published by Faber & Faber on 1 March 2018. Read on for an extract!Chapter OneJUNE 11, 1995BELLEVILLE, DELAWARE It’s the sunburned shoulders that get him. Pink, peeling. The burn istwo days old, he gauges. Earned on Friday, painful to the touch yesterday,today an itchy soreness that’s hard not to keep fingering, probing, as she’sdoing right now in an absentminded way. The skin has started sloughing off,soon those narrow shoulders won’t be so tender. Why would a redhead well intoher thirties make such a rookie mistake? And why is she here, sittingon a barstool, forty-five miles inland, in a town where strangers seldom stopon a Sunday evening? Belleville is the kind of place where people are supposedto pass through and soon they won’t even do that. They’re building a big bypassso the beach traffic won’t have to slow for the speed trap on the old MainStreet. He saw the construction vehicles, idle on Sunday, on his way in. Placeslike this bar-slash-restaurant, the High-Ho, are probably going to lose whatlittle business they have. High-Ho. A misprint? Was it supposedto be Heigh-Ho? And if so, was it for the seven dwarfs, heading home from themines at day’s end, or for the Lone Ranger, riding off into the sunset? Neitherone makes much sense for this place. Nothing about this makes sense. Her shoulders are thin, pointy,hunched up so close to her ears that they make him think of wings. The front ofher pink-and-yellow sundress is quite a contrast, full and round. She carriesherself as if she doesn’t want to attract any male attention, at least nottonight. On the front, he can’t help noticing as he slides on a barstool, she’snot so pink. The little strip of skin showing above the relatively high- neckeddress has only the faintest hint of color. Ditto, her cheeks. It is early June,with a breeze that makes it easy to forget how strong the sun is already.Clearly a modest type, she wears a one-piece, so there’s probably a deep U ofred to go with those shoulders. Yesterday, fingerprints pressed there wouldhave left white marks. He wonders if she’s meeting someonehere, someone who will rub cream into the places she can’t reach. He would besurprised if she is. More surprised if she’s up for leaving with a stranger,not shocked by either scenario. Sure, she gives off a prim vibe, but those arethe ones you have to watch out for. One thing’s for sure: she’s up to something.His instincts for this stuff can’t be denied. He doesn’t go in hard. He’s not thatway. Doesn’t have to be, if that doesn’t sound too vain. It’s just a fact: he’sa Ken doll kind of guy, if Ken had a great year-round tan. Tall and muscularwith even features, pale eyes, dark hair. Women always assume that Ken wants aBarbie, but he prefers his women thin and a little skittish. In his downtime,he likes to hunt deer. Bow and arrow. He goes to the woods of western Maryland,where he can spend an entire day sitting in a tree, waiting, and he loves it.Tom Petty was wrong about that. The waiting’s not the hardest part. Waiting canbe beautiful, lush, full of possibility. When he was a kid, growing up in the BayArea, his ahead-of-the-curve beat parents put him in this study at Stanfordwhere he was asked to sit in a room with a marshmallow for fifteen minutes. Hewould get two if he didn’t eat the one while he waited. He had asked, Howlong do I have to sit here for three? They laughed. He didn’t learn until he was in histwenties that he was part of some study that was trying to determine if there’sa correlation between success and a kid’s ability to manage the desire forinstant gratification. He still thinks it was unfair that the experiment wasn’torganized in a way that allowed a kid to get three marshmallows for sittingtwice as long as anyone else. He has left two stools between them,not wanting to crowd her, but he makes sure she hears when he orders a glass ofwine. That catches her attention, asking for wine instead of beer in a placelike this. That was the idea, catching her attention. She doesn’t speak, butglances sideways when he asks the blonde behind the bar what kind of wine theyserve. He doesn’t break balls over the selection, which is red and white.Literally: “We have red and we have white.” He doesn’t bat an eyelash when theyserve him the red cold. Not a sommelier-ordained-sixty-degree cold, butstraight-from-the-fridge cold. He takes a sip, summons the barmaid back, andsays, oh so politely, “You know what? I’m happy to pay for this, but it’s notto my taste. May I have a beer?” He glances at the taps. “Goose Island?” Another quick sideways flick of hereyes, then back to her own drink—amber, rocks. Wherever she’s going tonight,it’s not far from here. He looks into his own drink and says out loud, as if tohimself: “What kind of an asshole orders red wine in a tavern in Belleville,Delaware?” “I don’t know,” she says, notlooking at him. “What kind of an asshole are you?” “Garden variety.” Or so his exes—onewife for a span of five years, maybe seven, eight girlfriends, which strikeshim as a respectable number for a thirty-eight-year-old man—always told him.“You from around here?” “Define from.” She’s notplaying, she’s retreating. “Do you live here?” “I do now.” “That sunburn—I just assumed youwere someone who got a day or two of beach, was headed back to Baltimore orD.C.” “No. I’m living here.” He sees a flicker of surprise on thebarmaid’s face. “As of when?” “Now.” A joke, he thinks. A person doesn’tjust stop for a drink in a strange town and decide to live there. Not thistown. It’s not like she’s rolled into Tuscany or Oaxaca, two places he knowswell and can imagine a person saying, Yes, here, this is where I’m going toplant myself. She’s in Belleville, Delaware, with its saggy, sad MainStreet, a town of not even two thousand people surrounded by corn fields andchicken farms. Does she have connections here? The barmaid sure doesn’t treather like a local, even a potential one. To the barmaid, blond and busty with acarefully nurtured tan, the redhead is furniture. The barmaid is interested inhim, however, trying to figure out whether he’s passing through tonight or hangingaround. Which has not yet been determined. “Let me know if you want someone togive you the skinny on this place,” the barmaid says to him with a wink. “Itwould take all of five minutes.” Barmaids and waitresses who flirtthis overtly make him a little nervous. Bringing a man food or beer is intimateenough. He lets both women alone, drinks hisbeer, watches the inevitable Orioles games on the inevitable TV with theinevitable shimmy in its reception. The team is good again, or, at least,better. As the redhead’s third drink reaches its last quarter inch, he settlesup, leaves without saying good-bye to anyone, goes to his truck in the gravelparking lot, and sits in the dark. Not hiding because there’s no better way tobe found than to try to hide. Ten minutes later, the redhead comesout. She crosses the highway, heads to the old-fashioned motel on the otherside, the kind they call a motor court. This one is named Valley View, althoughthere’s no valley and no view.

He waits fifteen minutes, thenenters the little office at the end, and inquires if there’s a room, despitethe big red vacancy sign filling the window. “How many nights?” the clerk, apencil-necked guy in his thirties, asks. “Open-ended. I can give you a creditcard, if you like.” “Funny. You’re the second persontoday to ask for an open-ended stay.” He doesn’t have to ask who the firstone was. He makes a note to himself that the chatty clerk will be chatty abouthim, too. “You need my credit card?” “Cash is fine, too. If you commit toa week, we can give you the room for two hundred fifty. We don’t get manypeople Monday through Friday. But, you know, there’s no kitchenette, norefrigerator. You gotta eat your meals out or bring stuff in that won’t spoil.”He adds, “If the maid sees stuff sitting out, she’ll tell me. I don’t want antsor roaches.” “Can I keep a cooler in the room?” “As long as it doesn’t leak.” Hehands the credit card over. “I can give you a better rate if you pay cash,” theguy says, clearing his throat. “Two hundred twenty dollars.” Guy’s got somesort of scam going, must be skimming the cash payments, but what does he care?He can last a long time in a place that’s $220 a week, even if there’s norefrigerator or stove.

{"title": "Authors' Creative Pursuits: Thomas Enger", "date": "Thursday 8 March 2018", "text": "Authors are a very creative bunch - and for many of them, this isn’t only with words on the page. From drawing to painting, pottery to needlework, composing to singing, here’s a look at some authors’ creative pursuits.I am delighted to welcome THOMAS ENGERAUTHOR OF KILLED(PUBLISHED BY ORENDA BOOKS)TO TALK ABOUT HIS LOVE OF MUSICHave you always playedthe piano?I started playing at the age of seven, and I did takelessons for about seven years. However, I'm almost illiterate when it comes toreading notes, and for a long period of time I hid that from my piano teacherby making her play the songs for me, and then I would memorise them and learnhow to play them by ear. Needless to say, progress was slow, and for a goodlong while I only played the piano when I was having 'lessons'. Ididn't really get anywhere with it, (I must have struggled with Beethoven'sMoonlight Sonata for YEARS), so I stopped altogether when I was about 13. For afew years even the thought of playing the piano repulsed me; I was so fed upwith it. Until something quite magical happened when I was about 18... (noticethe cliffhanger here? Occupational hazard...)And have you alwayscomposed music?This is a funny story. Well, not ha-ha funny, but ...bear with me here for a second. When I was about 18 I was watching this movie,and there was a song on it towards the end which struck a chord in me (pardonthe pun). It was a sad song, a piano song, and this was way before the age ofSpotify and internet, so I couldn't just look it up and listen to it after thefilm was over. So I learned it by ear and ran up to the piano, just to see if Iwas able to play it. Because I loved it. And would you believe it, after just afew minutes of me tinkering around with these unfamiliar keys - there it was.The whole song. I could actually play it. That just completely blew my mind,and it sparked my interest for the instrument again, let me tell you. I triedto play some other songs I knew. Could play them, too, quite quickly. And aftera while I wanted to see if I could compose some songs for myself, and ... youknow the answer to that as well. After a while I played a few of them for myDad, and he loved them. So I've been making music ever since.Which movie was it, you may wonder? 9 1/2 weeks starring KimBasinger and Mickey Rourke. Yes, the one (the closest thing you got to pornback in those days). I was 18, remember?How often do you playthe piano and compose?It depends on my schedule, and it comes and goes a lot. Ican easily go for a few weeks without playing it at all, while in other periodsof time I'm on it on a daily basis. For hours. Especially if there's somethingI need to process somehow. I find it very rewarding to be able to put feelingsor emotions into a piece of music.Do you think yourcomposing/music helps your writing?Not really. They are two completely different processes. Thewriting has a lot to do with learning the craft and applying the tools that areavailable to you (through many years of experience and trying), while the musicthing has a lot more to do with instinct. I just feel my way through the piano keys. But I would say that the music,whether it's mine or the work of others, is helpful in the way that I listen tomusic all the time when I'm writing. Depending on what kind of scene I'mwriting, I can choose music accordingly. Metallica, for instance, is perfectwhen I want to write a fight scene. Guess I don't have to explain that.And do you think yourwriting helps your composing/music?Not in a specific way, no. But what I've found over theyears I've been doing this, is that writing is a good way to process or examinemy own views or feelings towards certain topics or challenges. I've said this anumber of times on panels, but it's true: I don't think I could have writtenHenning Juul, a man who has lost his son in a domestic fire, without theexperience of being a father myself. To write about a man like that, who hasexperienced something so horrible, I needed to imagine what that would be like,and it made me appreciate being a father a whole lot more. And, I think,because of that, I became a better one. You can imagine the amount of music Ihave composed over the years when I tried to process the emotions of having losta child.Can you provide a linkto an example of your music?I most certainly can. I have just started a musicalcollaboration with a magnificent violin player in Norway called Ingrid BergMehus. We have named our project Moods From Norway, and we have just releasedour first single, Torn.Here's the YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amnuunQ2SjwIs your musicavailable to buy/download/listen to?You can find us on Spotify or iTunes as well, or any otherdigital platform there is.Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/7JLiZW4iS18uhVdjeBfDm7?si=SAKJpTD0SbeOm3-MM0CcRAiTunes:https://itunes.apple.com/no/album/torn/1348396791?i=1348396802&l=nbOr you can check out my Soundcloud account: https://soundcloud.com/thomasenger/tracksTHANKS FOR TAKING PART, THOMAS!About THOMAS ENGERThomas Enger (b. 1973) is a former journalist.

Because Juliette has a plan to win him back.She is the perfect girlfriend. And she'll make sure no one stops her from getting exactly what she wants.True love hurts, but Juliette knows it's worth all thepain...My verdictThe Perfect Girlfriend is a brilliant page-turning tale of obsession - think Fatal Attraction meets Misery! There's a fine line between love and hate.Juliette loves Nate so much she hurts (literary). She's such a brilliant narrator - truly unforgettable - and I loved being inside her twisted mind. She's certainly not someone you want to get on the wrong side of - though plenty of people do. She's totally unhinged and unpredictable and so determined - nothing and no one can, or will, get in her way.Juliette is a mysterious character at first, but gradually you get to know more about her past and what's influenced her present. Her underlying insecurities made me feel sympathetic, despite my reluctance to do so. And even when she was at her most obsessive, and most evil, I still felt sorry for her (and then, on the quiet, wanted her to succeed).The Perfect Girlfriend is creepy and chilling. A very bumpy rollercoaster ride and I felt so tense by the end. It's a great holiday read - but next time I travel by plane, I'll be watching the flight crew very very closely.After reading this book, my first piece of advice is 'Don't mess with a woman on the edge!' My second piece of advice is 'Read this book, so you too can meet Juliette!'"},
{"title": "If I Die Before I Wake by Emily Koch", "date": "Tuesday 6 March 2018", "text": "If I Die Before I WakeBy Emily KochPublished by Harvill Secker (11 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionHOW DO YOU SOLVE YOUR OWN MURDER?Everyone believes Alex is in a coma, unlikely to ever wakeup. As his family debate withdrawing life support, and his friends talk abouthow his girlfriend Bea needs to move on, he can only listen.But Alex soon begins to suspect that the accident that puthim here wasn’t really an accident. Even worse, the perpetrator is still outthere and Alex is not the only one in danger. As he goes over a series of clues from his past, Alex mustuse his remaining senses to solve the mystery of who tried to kill him, and tryto protect those he loves, before they decide to let him go.My verdictIf I Die Before I Wake had an intriguing premise, with an unlikely narrator, so I was curious to read it. And it certainly didn't let me down.After a tragic climbing incident, Alex is in a coma, believed to be brain dead but suffering from locked-in syndrome. He can feel and hear his family and friends around him, as well as hospital staff, but can't communicate with them. Thinking about past events (as he can't do much else), he becomes convinced that someone deliberately tried to kill him, and that it wasn't an accident at all. Since he's not expected to wake from his coma, that person has probably succeeded. But how do you solve your own murder if you can't see, speak or move?If I Die Before I Wake is an easy-to-read psychological thriller, narrated in a natural chatty voice. It's clearly been well researched, and seems realistic and believable. You're right inside Alex's head, which creates a sensory experience as his touch and hearing are heightened, with great descriptions of what he can feel and hear.As Alex's memories return, this helps him put together the clues of the past to discover there's a killer on the loose. You can sense his frustration and also his sadness that he can't warn his family and friends. There's a sense of urgency too as the killer could try again.This is an original haunting debut, with some great writing, and plenty of shocks in store. A compelling heart-breaking story that will linger long after the final page."},

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome JOSEPHINE HAYESLiterary AgentatThe Blair PartnershipWhat and when was your first job in publishing?I startedout as Editorial Assistant in the editorial department at the British MedicalJournal in 2009. Having studied history at university and been very much ahumanities student throughout my school years, it was a new dive into thescience/medical world for me where I learnt a great deal about proofreading,copyediting and the fast pace of weekly journal publishing.How long have you been working in your current job/role?I've beenat The Blair Partnership for about two years and am looking forward to returningfrom maternity leave to pick up my role as Agent in early 2018. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?Before going off to have my first baby in spring 2017, Iworked on a number of exciting projects, including the hugely inspiring anduplifting memoir The Little Big Things by quadriplegic mouth artistand motivational speaker Henry Fraser, published by Seven Dials in September2017. The book combines Henry's wisdom and insight into finding the giftsin life's challenges, and his belief that every day is a good day. I alsooversaw the exciting publication of a brilliant children's adventure fictionseries by Kieran Larwood. The first book in the series 'The Legend ofPodkin One-Ear' won the 2017 Blue Peter Book Award. As well as alsoworking on lots of exciting YA and adult commercial fiction with newand existing clients, I also negotiated a deal with Orion for a fantasticdebut author, Niki Mackay, for the first books in her crime fiction seriesfeaturing a compelling female Private Investigator.Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I enjoymeeting people and forming the close working relationships that agentingrequires. I'm a 'glass half-full' type of person, and combined withpassion, perseverance and belief in a project, I hope that I provideclients with a high level of support and encouragement through the highs andlows of getting published and the entire publishing process. I am extremelypassionate about reading and love to keep an eye on what's hot in the market -I constantly try and race through books while the baby is sleeping! - andenjoy scrutinising new fiction to spot things that work and those thathaven't quite met the mark. I have a perfectionist's eye for detail and theproofreading and editing skills I gained at the BMJ and since then have set mein good stead for analysing unsolicited submissions in the slush pileand preparing work to send to publishers. How do you relax after a busy working day?I enjoya nice glass of wine and catching up with friends after work, and wherepossible try and make time for yoga and watching great TV dramas anddocumentaries in the evening. I always have my nose in a book on the train (ifno pressing work manuscript is currently commanding my attention) and alsolove winding down by listening to podcasts, particularly Desert Island Discs -each episode is such an inspiring glimpse into the interviewee's life.What was the last book you read for pleasure?I readFrancis Spufford's Golden Hill which is fantastically clever andextremely well-written. It kept me totally engrossed from start to finish and Icouldn't see where the story was going until the end, which I love, as I'malways trying to guess the direction of a plot as I read. I also recentlyread All the Light We Cannot See by AnthonyDoerr which I thought was beautifully written and very moving.Describe your job in 15 words or less...Creative management, champion of ideas,avid reader, negotiator, counsellor and friend. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farHighlightsof my publishing career so far have to be negotiating deals for authors' firstworks, such as The It Girl series by debut children's fictionauthor Katy Birchall at my last agency (Katy is now successfully publishedaround the world and has many brilliant books under her belt) and I,Witness - the first books in the Madison Attalee Private Investigatorseries by debut crime fiction author Niki Mackay. It gives you such a massivesense of pride working with talented authors, and the process ofnegotiating a good deal and letting the author know the good news, and that alltheir hard work has culminated in a well-deserved publishing deal, is massivelyrewarding.If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I'd love tobe a Red Arrows pilot - seeing them flying in formation blows mymind. It requires so much skill, intense concentration, nerveand precision - it is such an unknown entity to me, where the mostdangerous thing that could happen in my working day is gettinga paper cut!If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?That's atough one. I really like the quote 'Comparison is the Thief of Joy',by Teddy Roosevelt. There are so many people trying to make it aswriters in the world, and so it's important to remember that not onlywhat individuals write varies so much, but what people want to read istotally different too. There is always space in the market for newwell-written, creative work, so have the strength and self-belief to stayfocused on your goal and respect others' work, without comparing yourexperiences too closely to the successes and near-misses of those around you.Thanks so much for taking part, Josephine!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},

But equally I have just started reading ClareMackintosh’s new book, and it’s just as good as all her others. And there are somany more brilliant authors…... FILMS/MOVIESI loved PresumedInnocent. I know it’s an old one, but it was very clever. A film thatstayed with me for a long time was Sleepingwith the Enemy. The scene in the kitchen when she finds all her cansorganised and her towels lined up makes me shiver to think about it....

I’m also slightlyobsessed with The Black List, and have just started with series 1, so I still haveabout a hundred episodes to watch.... FICTIONAL KILLERSMax de Winter. He is the first killer that I ever hopedwould get away with his crime. Until I read Rebecca, it never occurred to methat I might have sympathy with a murderer, but now I like to considercarefully whether my killer is really bad – or... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Morse is very high on my list – in the books, rather than onthe TV. He is intelligent, but has an edge to him without being a completeno-hoper, as so many fictional detectives now seem to be.... MURDER WEAPONSI particularly like anything from nature such as venom orplant extracts. I used liquid nicotine in my first book, but there are so manyoptions – ricin, deadly nightshade, oleander. Much more subtle than a gun or aknife.    ... DEATH SCENESThe execution of Rinaldo Pazzi in the film Hannibal takessome beating. Anthony Hopkins is so amazing, and horrific as it is, he has away of making it a bizarre mixture of truly shocking and sickeningly funny.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThis sounds a bit gruesome, but I do use The ForensicsLibrary quite a lot. I need to understand how my character may have died, andwhat the pathologist might be looking for. I also use the Crown ProsecutionService website regularly to check on the correct words to use in relation tocrimes, and what the prison sentences might be.... WRITING TIPSAlways read your book out loud at least once. You will beamazed at how much you pick up. Words that you don’t realise you have repeatedwill suddenly – quite literally – ring a bell when you hear them spoken.... WRITING SNACKSI know this is where I should say that it’s a bad habit toget into, but I’m full of bad habits, so that’s okay. I absolutely loveWaitrose Belgian White Chocolate Cookies.

Not only is hischaracterisation fantastic and makes you want to keep reading to find out whathappens to the characters, the stories he weaves are utterly brilliant. Hisability to see the nuances of human nature just completely draws you in. ... FILMS/MOVIESThe psychological thriller, Unthinkable, with Samuel LJackson, which looks at whether someone would commit the act of torture in orderto save hundreds of thousands of people as a large US city faces the prospectof 3 nuclear bombs going off. And they have someone in their custody who knowsthe whereabouts of those devices. It’s pretty tense stuff and a film I don’tthink I will ever forget. Hard watching. ... TV DRAMASI do likewatching US based drama so I’m going to go with something I watched recentlywhich was Ozark. A Netflix drama. (Am I allowed to go with Netflix?) I adoredthe main character played by Jason Bateman, I mean, who doesn’t want to watchhim in a straight (non-comedic) role? Plus, it had some great writing and younever knew what was going to happen next. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSRobertNaysmith from Fergus McNeill’s book Eye Contact. It’s told from the point ofview of Naysmith and I particularly loved the unique way in which he chooseshis victims and I was particularly absorbed by the fact that the book was toldfrom the point of view of the killer. It made for a fabulous read. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES DCI HarryNelson from Elly Griffiths’ Ruth Galloway novels. I love this series and I lovecranky old Nelson and the very human mess he makes of his life as he does his job. ... MURDER WEAPONSThere was afantastically simple murder weapon of sticky tape in Random by Craig Robertson.Just brilliant.     ... DEATH SCENESThere’s ascene in Cry Baby by David Jackson that just takes your breath away. In fact,you could probably pick up any of his books and have your breath taken away bya death scene.   ...

{"title": "Anatomy of a Scandal by Sarah Vaughan", "date": "Monday 26 February 2018", "text": "Anatomy of a ScandalBy Sarah VaughanPublished by Simon & Schuster (11 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionA high-profile marriagethrust into the spotlight. A wife, determined to keep her family safe, mustface a prosecutor who believes justice has been a long time coming. Ascandal that will rock Westminster. And the women caught at the heart of it. Anatomy of a Scandal centres on ahigh-profile marriage that begins to unravel when the husband is accused of aterrible crime. Sophie is sure her husband, James, is innocent and desperatelyhopes to protect her precious family from the lies which might ruin them. Kateis the barrister who will prosecute the case – she is equally certain thatJames is guilty and determined he will pay for his crimes.My verdictWhen I finished reading Anatomy of a Scandal, I was suffering from flu. I didn't have the brain power to write a full review, so I created a Twitter banner instead.This Twitter banner really does summarise my thoughts:'Anatomy of a Scandal is twisty, gripping, thought-provoking, multi-layered, heart-stopping and breath-holding brilliance. Very much a novel of modern times. The writing is sublime. Wow!'And now I'm attempting to put my thoughts into something longer and more coherent. But I'm still struggling as there's so much I want to say and I don't feel I can do this book justice. I'm not mentioning anything about the plot (so no spoilers) and I'm not mentioning specific characters either - but I am mentioning the themes.Anatomy of a Scandal is a courtroom drama combined with psychological thriller. It's a believable and gripping dissection of an affair and a marriage, a window into the lives of politicians and barristers and a thought-provoking insight into class divide. There's the topical 'Me Too' theme, about the strength of women and issues surrounding consent. This multi-layered plot is filled with moral dilemmas and themes of revenge, truth, lies and privilege.For me, my enjoyment of the book wasn't about the twists, shocks and surprises - that doesn't mean there aren't any, but I did guess certain things. Instead, I appreciated how much this book got right under my skin, right until the end. And how it raised so many questions.I read Anatomy of a Scandal with another reader, stopping after a few chapters and discussing our thoughts. I'm so glad that I read it in this way, as this book needs to be discussed and dissected,. Anatomy of a Scandal is a perfect choice for a reading group/book club, and the type of book that I would read again and again."},

{"title": "Dark Pines by Will Dean", "date": "Wednesday 21 February 2018", "text": "Dark Pinesby Will DeanPublished by Point Blank (4 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalley.Publisher's descriptionAn isolated Swedish town.A deaf reporter terrified of nature.A dense spruce forest overdue for harvest.A pair of eyeless hunters found murdered in thewoods.It’s week one of the Swedish elk hunt and thesound of gunfire is everywhere. When Tuva Moodyson investigates the story thatcould make her career she stumbles on a web of secrets that knit Gavrik towntogether. Are the latest murders connected to the Medusa killings twenty yearsago? Is someone following her? Why take the eyes? Tuva must face her demons andventure deep into the woods to stop the killer and write the story. And thenget the hell out of Gavrik.My verdictDark Pines is an atmospheric whodunnit set in wintry Sweden.This book was certainly a page-turner, with a plot that moved along at a steady pace, slower at first and then faster as the tension built up towards the end. The writing is stunning, with the depth of detail enhancing the story without detracting from it. Not only does the small cast of characters give the book a claustrophobic vibe, but vivid descriptions of the dark pine forests, and also the climate, create a chilling setting.Bodies have been discovered with gunshot wounds and their eyes removed - the same as Medusa murders in the area in the 1990s. Is it the same killer or a copycat? Not all of the locals are happy about local journalist Tuva Moodyson investigating, dredging up the past and also potentially portraying the small close-knit town in a bad light. But Tuva is an independent and determined character.Tuva's deafness gives her vulnerability, creating a sense of danger throughout the book. She has to rely on her sight when her hearing aid batteries are failing or when she removes them in the rain. Not ideal when you're stumbling in the darkness in wintry conditions, and also fear nature and the forest environment. I admit that I did get a little frustrated when the batteries kept failing and she didn't automatically have spares with her at all times - I would have expected this to be second nature to her. However, the details of her maintaining her hearing aids, and how she deals her deafness, were well-integrated into the story. And her deafness has certainly not held her back in any way.The book features some very distinct quirky characters and also some very sinister ones - they are well described and well placed, bringing the whole book to life. All quite possibly could be the Medusa killer that Tuva (and the local police) are seeking. Like Tuva, I found myself stumbling around in the darkness as I tried to put together the clues.Dark Pines kept me guessing, with some great twists, turns and red herrings. Suspense seeped through the pages. I predict lots of award nominations, shortlists and possibly top prizes for this book, with great times ahead. I'm looking forward to the next one in the series."},

As Iswim, all I do is make sure I know which length I’m on and then let my mindwander. Many plot points or next sentences have come to me this way.SilenceIdon’t like noise when I’m writing: the best place for me would be a cottage ona remote hillside with only sheep for company. Unfortunately, real life isn’tlike that and so I normally have to contend with building noise, traffic noiseand when my husband is working from home, his music!FootrestI couldn’t write without this. It’s been invaluable in gettingme to sit up straight when I’m at my desk. SleeplessnessI love that moment when the day is over, the house is quiet and I’m lying inbed staring into the dark. Like with swimming, these are the times that I seethings more clearly and in the quiet, can listen to what my characters aretelling me.Facebook and TwitterKeeping in touch with people on social media is such a comfort.Being able to provide support to others and seek it for myself reminds me thatI’m part of one big writing community.TVIobviously value my friends but I also love watching ‘Friends’ reruns on TV or,if I have a bit more time, I adore murder mysteries such as Morse, Lewis,Poirot, Foyles War, etc. For me, watching these programmes is like kicking off myshoes, getting under a blanket and having forty winks.My charactersI couldn’t write without them. There’s that marvelous moment whenI’m writing (at about 40,000 words) when they move in to my head and my heartand it’s almost as though they start dictating the plot. I see and hear them soclearly that when I reach ‘The End’ I find I mourn their going.Boiled eggs and soldiersThis is what I promise myself after swimming and after a daily targetof 1,600 words.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Tim Baker", "date": "Monday 19 February 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome TIM BAKERto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSIt is astonishing to realise that Ross Macdonald’s series of books featuring P.I. Lew Archer (two ofwhich were made into the Paul Newman Harpermovies) began life 70 years ago. There is a freshness and modern relevance inhis work that you just don’t find in the novels of his contemporaries –including Chandler and Hammett.If Macdonald is the summit of the shamus, Patricia Highsmith is the highest peak ofpsychological suspense, whether in her best known novels such as Strangers on a Train or her unjustlylesser-known works, such as the superb, Mexican-set thriller, A Game for the Living.... FILMS/MOVIESFrom the stunning cinematography to the haunting theme, Chinatownis hard to beat, and even boasts the creepy presence of the man whoinvented the Private Eye movie, John Huston.Out of the Past is a prime example of romantic, doomedexistentialism, as is Sweet Smell of Success, withSidney’s smug code for the completion of a successful crime, “The cat’s in the bagand the bag’s in the river”, one of filmnoir’s most memorable lines. But perhaps best of all is René Clément’s adaptation of PatriciaHighsmith’s masterpiece, with Alain Delon playing Tom Ripley in PleinSoleil (Purple Noon inEnglish) – oh, that ending! ... TV DRAMASThe Sopranos and The Wire created the template forthe contemporary crime saga. Breaking Bad broke ground with itssuperb character development and insanely good plotting. And Lifeon Mars was memorable for its humour and humanity.But if I had to choose one show, it would be season one of TrueDetective. Everything about it felt epic, from the extraordinary sixminute, single take, tracking shot in episode four to the dual themes of darknessand redemption and the relationship between Rust and Hart – best of enemies,worst of friends. Amazing.... FICTIONAL KILLERSFirstly, I personally prefer killers who remain safelyfictional. Secondly, as much as I love Anthony Hopkins and Mads Mikkelsen asactors, I can’t get my head around HannibalLecter being this loveable, charismatic killer everyone wants to hang with –probably because I was never a fan of either fava beans or Chianti.So, if you have to buddy up with a killer, you better findone who’s fun to be around. Enter the perfect insane killer companion: Emilio Largo from Ian Fleming’s Thunderball. He has a cool eyepatch, a girlfriendcalled Domino, a villa in Nassau and spends his days tooling around in asouped-up super yacht called the Disco Volante – what’s not to like? Plus ifyou hang with him long enough, you’ll end up meeting James Bond… or at least AustinPowers. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Special agents DanaScully (X-Files), Clarice Starling (The Silence of the Lambs) and Dale Cooper (Twin Peaks) are all top-drawer, kick-ass investigators – but they alsoall work for the Bureau – not my favourite outfit (J Edgar was a nasty characterin my novel, Fever City). So I’m going for an old-fashioned, independent detective, Hercule Poirot: a brilliant mind, aseeker of truth and justice, and an amusing and generous companion. He is alsothat most undervalued of persons at the moment: a European resident of the UK.I can only imagine how hurt he would have been by the Brexit vote. Mon Dieu, even his little grey cellswould short-circuit trying to understand that mess. If Monsieur Poirot were to be deported back to Belgium, I’dchoose The Dude from The Big Lebowski – provided that someonewould promise to rescue me after three days in his company. Nothing much wouldget solved with the Dude around, but at least there’d be good music, plenty ofbowling and more White Russians than you could shake a Persian rug at. ... MURDER WEAPONSI was about seven years old when I heard my mother cry outin shock, and then, inexplicably, start laughing. I ran into the lounge roomjust in time to see the already familiar figure of Alfred Hitchcock intoning his farewells on Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The TV episode in question was called Lamb to the Slaughter and was written byRoald Dahl. There may possibly be abetter murder weapon in crime fiction, but there has never been a better meansof disposing of one.     ... DEATH SCENESThe best death scene I can recall is actually a near miss:the almost assassination of President Charles de Gaulle in The Day of the Jackal. It is as if all of Frederick Forsyth’s brilliant attention to the minutiae of Frenchlife and society has been in service to this one, brilliant scene.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESTwitter is greatif you’re just starting out writing: it not only offers you direct insight intowhat agents and editors are currently looking for, it also affords anopportunity to interact with other crime writers – who tend to be a prettycongenial bunch. Just don’t forget to mute the accounts of Donald Trump,Morrissey and Katie Hopkins first. ... WRITING TIPSNever Plan Your Books.A crime novel is an investigation; a search for meaning and truth – and thatsearch begins with the writer. Never be afraid to stumble along in the dark, followred herrings, or get cold sweats when you run into a dead-end alley. So what ifsometimes you’ll find yourself contemplating arson with your very ownmanuscript? The chills and thrills you’ll get flying blind will translate intoyour work – and remember: if something doesn’t make sense, you can always fixit in the end! It’s called cheating and no one’s ever going to catch you aslong as you wear gloves, cover your tracks, and avoid using your credit cardclose to the crime scene. ... WRITING SNACKSSnacks are indispensable as I tend to forget to eat lunchwhen I’m writing. In summer, it’s unsalted cashews and rosé. In winter, RussianEarl Grey tea and dark chocolate. Life is too short and your editor isn’t goingto be kind to you, so pamper yourself a little! About TIM BAKERBorn in Sydney, Tim Baker has lived in Rome, Madrid andParis and currently lives in the South of France with his wife, their son, andtwo rescue animals, a dog and a cat.

{"title": "Fear by Dirk Kurbjuweit", "date": "Friday 16 February 2018", "text": "FearBy Dirk KurbjuweitPublished by Orion (25 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionYou'd die for your family. But would you kill forthem?Family is everything. So whatif yours was being terrorised by a neighbour - a man who doesn't listen toreason, whose actions become more erratic and sinister with each passing day?And those you thought would help - the police, your lawyer - can't help you.You become afraid to leaveyour family at home alone. But there's nothing more you can do to protect them.Is there?My verdictFear isn't what I expected and I admit that I wasn't sure about it at first. Yet the more I read, the more intrigued I became. What turns a mild-mannered non-confrontational man to take action to protect his family? This is definitely a book to make you think and read between the lines. A book that's designed to provoke a reaction and stimulate plenty of discussion.This isn't a fast-paced all-action thriller or even an emotional psychological thriller. Instead, it's a discussion about the psychology of fear, violence and stalking. It covers other themes too, such as how childhood trauma can impact on adult behaviour, and also focuses on the class divide - the narrator's contempt for his poor neighbour and the neighbour's contempt for the wealthy family above him.The narration reveals the inner turmoil of a family in crisis, unsure what to do and not wanting to make a fuss. Believing their lives are in danger, the family doesn't know who to turn to when the police and law won't - or can't - help.The book is fiction but is based on real life, which is maybe why it did seem so real. But while I was right inside the narrator's head, I found him very matter of fact about the events that affected his family. The author reveals in an introduction to the book that he didn't want to write about his own family's experiences (which were, in some ways, similar to those of his narrator). He had deliberately waited a while before writing the novel, so perhaps he didn't invest emotionally in his story so that he didn't dredge up the past. The book is translated from German, so I also wondered whether some of the sensitivity and emotion was lost during the translation process.I think that Fear is going to be a book that people will either love or hate. It's uncomfortable and disturbing reading at times, leaving me wondering 'what would I do' in those circumstances. So rather than expecting a high-octane action-packed rollercoaster read, be prepared for a book that will challenge your moral compass.The Last Day By Claire DyerPublished by Dome Press (15 February 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher Publisher's descriptionEveryending starts with a beginning; every beginning, an end. Boyd andVita have been separated for six years when Boyd asks if he can moveback in to the house they both still own, bringing with him histwenty-seven-year-old girlfriend, Honey. Of course,Vita agrees: enough water has travelled under enough bridges since her marriageto Boyd ended and she is totally over him; nothing can touch her now. Boyd andHoney move in and everyone is happy - or so it seems.However,all three are keeping secrets.My verdictThe Last Day is an emotional read with flowing poetic prose. This was one of those books that I had to read out loud at various points to appreciate the author's well-crafted words and beautifully observed character descriptions and interactions. It's tightly plotted, with a underlying sense of mystery about events to come.The story focuses on three main characters - Vita, her estranged husband Boyd and his young girlfriend Honey. This sounds like a recipe for disaster, but this book isn't a love triangle. It's told in the first person through Vita's eyes and through both Boyd and Honey in the third person. Yet through the author's beautiful writing, I felt that I got to know the characters equally well - their thoughts, beliefs and inner turmoil. I was living their lives with them.The Last Day is a story of relationships, love and marriage, grief, loss and tragedy, life's ups and downs, secrets, deception and lies. It's very much a story of people, rather than places, and is heartbreaking, compassionate and poignant. It's about who we love and how we love. What drives us and what breaks us. How secrets, and life events, can make us stronger but also weaken us. As the book evolves, secrets bubbling under the surface gradually spreading their wings towards the final page.The Last Day reminded me of the importance of living each day to the full, as we never know what's coming next. No day can be like the previous ones as our lives are constantly changing, and every day influences the days ahead of us - for better or for worse.I recently found these two quotes on 'last days'.

{"title": "Keeper by Johana Gustawsson", "date": "Wednesday 14 February 2018", "text": "KeeperBy Johana GustawssonTranslated by Maxim JakubowskiPublished by Orenda Books (e-book - 15 Feb 2018; paperback - 28 April 2018)Publisher's descriptionWhitechapel, 1888:London is bowed under Jack the Ripper’s reign of terror. London, 2015: actress Julianne Bell isabducted in a case similar to the terrible Tower Hamlets murders of some tenyears earlier, and harking back to the Ripper killings of a century before. Falkenberg, Sweden, 2015: a woman’s bodyis found mutilated in a forest, her wounds identical to those of the TowerHamlets victims. With the man arrested for the Tower Hamlets crimes alreadylocked up, do the new killings mean he has a dangerous accomplice, or is acopy-cat serial killer on the loose? Profiler Emily Roy and true-crime writer AlexisCastells again find themselves drawn into an intriguing case, with personallinks that turn their world upside down. My verdictAs with Johana Gustawsson's previous book, Block 46, Keeper prompted me to email the publisher Orenda Books with the phrase 'OMG' not long after I had turned the final page.I have to admit that initially when I started reading Keeper, I thought: 'This is going to be OK this time. My blood pressure isn’t going to rise. I'm not going to be stunned, shocked and speechless by the end'.But oh how wrong I was!Keeper left me not only shocked, stunned and speechless but also in need of a very alcoholic drink.Johana Gustawsson certainly isn't afraid to tackle shocking issues and leave her readers reeling. She puts her 'all' into her books. Her gorgeous writing is amazing, immersive and addictive, and it’s hard to believe that this is a translation (by Maxim Jakubowski). I couldn't stop reading, totally engrossed from the first page, as the book took me on a twisty rollercoaster ride.I’m not going to reveal anything about the book itself, as I feel it’s better to go in blind, knowing nothing (or very little) about the characters or the plot. There are some familiar ‘faces’ from Block 46, such as profiler Emily Roy and true crime writer Alexis Castells, but this book works exceptionally well as a standalone.I will say that from the start the book is split into three main threads (London 2015, Sweden 2015 and London 1888), which all gradually twine together until they become one. You will just have to read the book to find out why and how, just as I did. Be prepared for some graphic scenes that may make you wince or cringe, others that may make you smile and a few that may make you exclaim out loud.I know I'll be raving about Keeper just as much as I raved about Block 46 last year. And I already expect this to be one of my top reads of 2018. I can’t wait to see how Johana Gustawsson will shock me with her next book. Now there’s a challenge!If you haven't read my review of Block 46, you can find it here."},
{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Jemima Forrester", "date": "Tuesday 13 February 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome JEMIMA FORRESTERLiterary AgentatDavid Higham AssociatesWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first job in publishing was straight out of uni (aboutseven or eight years ago) when I did a stint of work experience with afreelance publicist. Aside from not being paid, it was a fantastic first job. Iworked with some big-name authors, got to go to lots of publishing parties(where you can network like mad) and, while it was hard work, I did get to doat least 50% at home in my PJs! My first paid job in publishing was as aneditorial assistant at Headline assisting three senior editors. I loved it,though as an editorial assistant I was rarely invited to the parties anymore!How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’m now a literary agent at David Higham Associates and I’vebeen here since September 2016. Between Headline and here, I spent five yearsworking my way up the ladder at Orion Books where I was commissioning crime andthriller and reading group fiction.Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?As an agent, I have a much broader list than I had as aneditor. I’m currently working on a historical novel about Heathcliff, a Swedish-setthriller, a really exciting commercial fantasy novel and a non-fiction bookabout fashion and feminism. One of the first books I sold as an agent, a quirkyupmarket mystery called The Colour of BeeLarkham’s Murder by Sarah J. Harris, is coming out in May this year andit’s getting so much great attention. I can’t wait to see it published and willprobably be pressing it into people’s hands all year!  Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?Being passionate about reading and reading really widelyacross multiple genres is probably the key qualification you need to work inpublishing. You won’t get far in this industry if books aren’t your bag! Theother quality I think really helps is being a people person and getting on wellwith people. Publishing thrives on personal connections and it’s crucial tohave good working relationships with your authors and colleagues if you want tosucceed. How do you relax after a busy working day?I am very fond of relaxing! I like to keep fit so I run andgo to the gym. I also make clothes and love losing myself in a sewing projectfor hours at a time. And I’m a huge bubble bath addict. If I could have oneevery day I would!What was the last book you read for pleasure?I actually reread (what an indulgence) Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I read it a few years agoand remembered how much I loved it. She’s such a wonderful writer. It was most definitelya pleasure.Describe your job in 15 words or less...Finding and developing talented writers and helping them toget their books published.What have been the highlights of your publishing life so far?There have been lots. Probably signing up my first authorwhen I was at Orion and selling my first book as an agent were key highlights.I also had an author who, having struggled with relatively small advances forseveral years, got a bit of a windfall last year and bought her dream house.Knowing I’d helped make that happen felt really special. Finally, it hasn’thappened yet, but when I have an author who hits number one on the charts, thatwill be a really big moment.If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?No one has asked me this question before! I feel like I wantmore time to ponder… But off the cuff I think being a seamstress would beamazing because I love sewing so I don’t think it would feel like work (I betthat’s what book lovers say about publishing!). And I always harboured astrange desire to be a florist.If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Ha! I’d like more time with this one too, but given I’mwriting this last thing on a Friday I’m going to plump for Nevertheless She Persisted. People outside the industry thinkpublishing is glamorous and all we do all day is read books. Actually it’stough, it can be very stressful and high-pressure and you deal with a lot ofrejection, especially on the agenting side. I’ve considered giving up in thepast (before I was an agent), but I’ve persisted and it’s been worth it for thesuccesses when they come, the wonderful authors I work with and my love of workingon books.Thanks so much for taking part, Jemima!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},

And a highly satisfactoryending. The scene in the sewer (you know the one) is one of the greatest film scenesof all time.... TV DRAMASI like alot of them, but for me Sopranos still rates as the best - even though theydragged it out a bit towards the end. I loved Breaking Bad, too, although thesame can be said about that show, too. TV dramas should know better when toquit while they're ahead.... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibal Lecter.

WRITING SNACKSI try tostay away from food while I write, as my keyboard gets sticky and nasty, butone thing I can't do without, is coffee. Lots of it. About THOMAS ENGERThomasEnger (b. 1973) is a former journalist. He made his debut with the crime novel Burned(Skinndød) in 2010, which became an international sensation beforepublication. Burned is the first in a series of 5 books about thejournalist Henning Juul, which delves into the depths of Oslo’s underbelly,skewering the corridors of dirty politics and nailing the fast-moving world of24-hour news. Rights to the series have been sold to 26 countries to date. In2013 Enger published his first book for young adults, a dark fantasy thrillercalled The Evil Legacy, for which he won the U-prize (best book YoungAdult). Enger also composes music, and he lives in Oslo. Find Thomas Enger on his website, on his Facebook page and on Twitter - @EngerThomasAbout KILLEDPublisher's descriptionCrimereporter Henning Juul thought his life was over when his young son wasmurdered.

The plot is dark, twisty and gritty, as Juul finds himself drawn further into the criminal underworld of Oslo, putting his life (and the lives of those around him) in danger. This is an emotional crime thriller filled with dark secrets, lies and revenge."},
{"title": "The Foster Child by Jenny Blackhurst", "date": "Friday 9 February 2018", "text": "The Foster ChildBy Jenny BlackhurstPublished by Headline (16 November 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionWhen child psychologist Imogen Reid takes on the case of11-year-old Ellie Atkinson, she refuses to listen to warnings that the girl isdangerous.Ellie was the only survivor of a fire that killed herfamily. Imogen is convinced she's just a sad and angry child struggling to copewith her loss.But Ellie's foster parents and teachers are starting to fearher. When she gets upset, bad things seem to happen. And as Imogen gets closerto Ellie, she may be putting herself in danger...My verdictThe Foster Child is without doubt one of the eeriest psychological thrillers I've read in a while. It's dark, disturbing and creepy - a very twisty read with more than a hint of Carrie-esque horror within its pages.I love Jenny Blackhurst's writing and how she really gets into her character's heads, looking into the psychology of 'why' as well as 'how'. All of her characters are so compelling, realistic and well-drawn that I changed my opinion of them throughout the book several times. This book is a very emotional thought-provoking read as well as being an intriguing one. There's so much going on, not only in the words on the pages, but also under the surface.The Foster Child gave me many 'gasp out loud in horror/surprise' moments, as it's filled with suspense and tension. Jenny Blackhurst manages to drip-feed little pockets of information like a trail of breadcrumbs - which kept me guessing and hanging on tenterhooks right until the end.With so many similar-themed psychological thrillers on the market, The Foster Child totally stands out from the crowd. Highly recommended!White BodiesBy Jane RobinsPublished by HQ Stories (28 December 2017)I received an Advance Review Copy from the publisher and through Lovereading Publisher's descriptionCallie loves Tilda. She’s her sister, after all. And she’sbeautiful and successful.Tilda loves Felix. He’s her husband. Successful andcharismatic, he is also controlling, suspicious and, possibly, dangerous.Still, Tilda loves Felix.And Callie loves Tilda. Very, very much.So she’s determined to save her. But the cost could destroythem all…Sometimes we love too much.My verdictWhite Bodies certainly played with my mind, turning this into an addictive read. How well do you know the people you love? Do you really know what they're thinking? Is everything you see on the surface real?This is a story about twin sisters who are as different as they can possibly be. Callie has always been obsessed with Tilda, recording everything about her sister's life in a secret dossier. When Tilda meets Felix, Callie becomes worried that he's too controlling and is determined to set her sister free.The writing is chilling, sharp and very readable, although Callie seemed very young for her age (mid-20s) and the sisters' behaviour felt more like that of teenagers than adults in places. I suspect that this was a consequence of their strange sibling relationship. Some of Callie's childhood behaviour is shocking and even disgusting, so readers be warned that you may cringe in places.The book does cover some dark themes, in particular centred around family relationships, mental health, manipulation, obsessive behaviour and domestic abuse. Yet it also has a fun element to it as well. The plot is very very twisty. I did predict a few things, I admit. Yet I found it hard to tear myself away from the story of Callie and Tilda and Felix who comes between them.I reckon White Bodies will divide opinion - a book that readers will love or hate. I personally found it to be highly entertaining."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Leigh Russell", "date": "Thursday 8 February 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome LEIGH RUSSELLto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSOf the many books I’ve read and enjoyed recently, I foundBill Beverley’s debut novel, Dodgers, really interesting. The book crossesgenres of crime, coming of age, and American road trip, and the writing is veryengaging. It’s deservedly won multiple awards, possibly more than any otherdebut novel. ... FILMS/MOVIESDepending on my mood, my favourite film could be anythingfrom Silence of the Lambs, with Anthony Hopkins’ memorable portrayal, to theeasy escapism of The Wizard of Oz. You couldn’t think of two more diversechoices, although both of them examine the conflict between good and evilcharacters. ... TV DRAMASBreaking Bad is a series I would recommend. The dialogue isconvincing, the cast are superb, and the premise of the series is reallyclever. The violence is quite graphic but somehow not disturbing because it’snever gratuitous. The series examines the destructive nature of hard drugsthrough an original and intriguing storyline. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSSome of the most memorable fictional killers appear inShakespeare, whose characters portray different aspects of human nature.Macbeth’s experience is an exploration of the effects of guilt, showing howeasily a person can become desensitised to killing, at the same time destroyinghimself by his own violence to others. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Sherlock Holmes is justifiably iconic and I find Conan Doyle’swriting endlessly entertaining. The crime genre has grown so much in recentyears, that there are hundreds of fictional detectives I could mention, fromold school examples Poirot and Miss Marple, to contemporary characters likeJack Reacher and Roy Grace. ... MURDER WEAPONSI’ve employed all sorts of murder weapons in my own books:guns, knives, ropes, poison, fire, water, and falling from a great height, tomention just a few. They would all be horrific in reality, but in fiction theyare great fun to write about. One of my own more unusual weapons was a Vikingaxe. But I am far more interested in the person wielding the weapon than theinstrument itself.     ... DEATH SCENESIn one of Ruth Rendell’s novels a character exacts a revengekilling on a woman responsible for the death of a child, without realising thewoman is already dead. In this unexpected twist, the would be killer wasprevented from actually committing a murder.    ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI don’t use any specific websites. I start with a story, anduse a search engine like Google to research whatever I need to know. It’s notalways possible to find specific information online, but generally the internetis a really helpful tool for any writer. ... WRITING TIPSIt’s a good idea to stop writing knowingwhat is going to happen next in your narrative. That way you will avoidso-called ‘writer’s block’ because when you return to your work you know whatto write about. ... WRITING SNACKSChocolate, nuts, toast, oh, anythingreally. I’m a highly skilled procrastinator, and food is one of my favouritedistractions from writing. About LEIGH RUSSELLLeigh Russell is the author of the internationally bestselling Geraldine Steelseries: Cut Short, Road Closed, Dead End, Death Bed,Stop Dead, Fatal Act, Killer Plan, Murder Ring, Deadly Alibi and ClassMurder.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Helen Fields", "date": "Wednesday 7 February 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome HELEN FIELDSfor her Perfect Death blog tourto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSJeff Lindsay who wrote the Dexter books. A tour deforce in terms of plotting, originality and character writing, Lindsay is a oneoff. The Dexter character is captivating and thrilling. More than that, thebooks are beautifully written, quite lyrical and intense. I can’t think ofanother author writing such unique crime as this. Even if you’ve watched the TVseries, it’s worth going back to the source material. Pretty much a masterclass in crime writing. ... FILMS/MOVIESMost recently, Get Out, which has just beenthe surprise nomination in the Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy categoryfor a Golden Globe. It’s not a comedy, although it contains moments of properbelly-laugh funniness. In fact, it’s about a town of white folks who kidnapyounger black people to utilise their bodies with extreme criminal intent (nomore spoilers - you should watch it). It’s scary, freakish, beautifullyanimated in parts and bizarrely believable in spite of the ridiculous plot.(Oh, and it stars Bradley Whitford who I kind of love).... TV DRAMASDefinitely Deadwood. Set in South Dakotain the 1870s the series incorporates a mixture of historical fact and fiction,along with some very well known Wild West characters. It’s a gory, crazy,action packed, funny, terrifying series featuring that stunning combination ofthe best dialogue I’ve heard with the most brilliant acting. Not to mention thesets (I could go on…). Really. Watch it. I was in awe. (And some of the bestscreen deaths ever).... FICTIONAL KILLERSDr. Hannibal Lecter, ofcourse. Silence of The Lambs will never grow old. Harris struck a note ofgenius in creating the antagonist who was also the protagonist. Lecter iscreepy but we like him. He’s a psychopathic murderer but we want him to escape.He’s likeable and awful. Perhaps the most well-rounded fictional killer evercreated. I dream of the day I discover the Hannibal in my imagination andcommit him to paper.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Jack Parlabane from Christopher Brookmyre’snovels. Parlabane is funny, dry witted, long-suffering, and finds troubleeverywhere he goes. And yet…and yet, he also manages (albeit in the guise ofjournalism) to say the day and solve the crime. I know I cheated - not adetective - but as good as. Go back to the old books first if you want to catchup with Jack Parlabane’s story. I have never laughed so hard at material that’sso dark. If I could go on a fictional date with any character, Parlabane wouldbe my man.... MURDER WEAPONSSpiders. Used more in films than in books,but I long to write something bizarre enough that I can release a jar of blackwidows under the bed covers of a sleeping character. Creepy and painful!Perfect combination.    ... DEATH SCENESI love the body made up of parts from sixdifferent people in Daniel Cole’s Ragdoll. What a brilliant idea. Justoccasionally you read someone else’s book and throw it across the room withjealousy at a concept (*turns green thinking about it all over again*).Stitching bits of different bodies together to make one complete corpse -what’s not to love?  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESGooglemaps, naturally. The world suddenlybecame a much easier place to write about after this feature became available.And TripAdvisor for more specific locations. The detail these sites offer canadd real colour and texture to descriptions. Also, I love the Trip Advisor badreviews. Endless sources of comedy.... WRITING TIPSRip up the rule book and write the way youwant to. Your editor will give you a hefty red pen session if they hate it, butdon’t do what everyone else tells you. I read recently that one agent advisesyou to remove every single adjective and adverb from your manuscript beforesending it to him. Poppycock. Everything in moderation and with purpose. Choosegood words. Use them wisely. But be yourself, listen to your own voice, createyour own unique narrative. Who wants to sound the same as everybody else?... WRITING SNACKSBiscuits. Then, when I’ve eaten too manybiscuits and I have carb/sugar guilt, I get through whole packs of pea shoots.The only salad I never get bored of.About HELEN FIELDSHelen Fields studied law at the University of East Anglia, then went on to theInns of Court School of Law in London.

Akiller whose pleasure comes from watching pain from afar? Faced with their mostdifficult case yet, Callanach and Turner soon realise they face a seeminglyimpossible task…My verdictUsually when I read a book for review I write some notes so it's easier to write a review afterwards. But I didn't get the chance to write any notes with Perfect Death as I read it in one sitting without any time to pause. This is definitely one of the best new detective series I have come across in a while. I've loved all three of the books so far.In case you missed it, here's my #BookLove2017 banner for the first two books in the series,All of the plots are intriguing, gritty and fast paced, which is why I can't put the books down once I start reading them. The crimes are bloody, dark and highly imaginative. The author clearly has a very twisted mind with a gift for plotting books that keep you guessing!Yet again, the writing in Perfect Death is compelling, containing acute observations of the characters and some humour within the dialogue. All of the characters in this series (including the killers) are so believable. In Perfect Death, you get to learn more about Callanach's family background, which provides some interesting and revealing home truths. Plus there's more sexual tension bubbling away between Callanach and Turner. The two detectives are growing with the series and it's great to see how they're developing.I can't really say much more, other than Perfect Death is brilliant and I recommend it highly to crime fiction fans. Oh, and finally, I must add that I can't wait for another Callanach/Turner book!Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "The Perfect Stranger by Megan Miranda", "date": "Tuesday 6 February 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for The Perfect Stranger by Megan Miranda. The Perfect Stranger was published by Corvus on 1st February 2018.The Perfect StrangerBy Megan MirandaPublished by Corvus (1 February 2018)I received an Advancer Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalley.Publisher's descriptionWhat happens when your best friend becomes your worstnightmare...Having reached a dead end in Boston, failed journalist LeahStevens needs a change. When she runs into an old friend, Emmy Grey, who ismoving to rural Pennsylvania, Leah decides to join her. But their fresh startis quickly threatened when a woman with an eerie resemblance to Leah isassaulted by the lake, and Emmy disappears days later.Determined to find Emmy, Leah helps Detective Kyle Donovan toinvestigate her friend's life for clues. But with no friends, family or digitalfootprint, the police begin to suspect that there is no Emmy Grey. Forced toquestion her version of reality and to save herself, Leah must uncover thetruth - no matter how dark or terrible it may be...My verdictThe Perfect Stranger is an unsettling multi-layered mystery.It took me on a journey alongside its protagonist Leah, who realises she knows very little about her housemate and friend Emmy who has disappeared. The local police aren't convinced that Emmy actually existed and even Leah begins to question her own sanity. Leah gradually reveals information about her own past as she sets out to discover more about her friend.The book is set in rural Pennsylvania, in a house backing onto dark woods, near a small town. Megan Miranda is a great writer, and her vivid descriptions certainly created a dark, haunting and claustrophobic atmosphere. The two main characters - Leah and Emmy - both have intriguing pasts (Emmy in particular has spun a web of lies) though neither was particularly likeable.I found The Perfect Stranger to be a quick read that kept me engaged from beginning to end. I did guess a few of the 'twists and turns' but certainly not all of them so there were still plenty of surprises. The book raised many questions about how well we know our friends, particularly those we see only every-so-often or keep in touch with via social media. It also shows how easy it can be to create a new identity when those around you don't know you at all.Follow the Blog Tour"},

{"title": "Lament the Common Bones by Jen J Danna and Ann Vanderlaan", "date": "Friday 2 February 2018", "text": "Lament the Common BonesBy Jen J Danna and Ann VanderlaanPublished on 21 November 2017 I received an Advance Reader Copy from the authors.Publisher's descriptionWhen death hides in plainsight, only the most discerning eye can see the truth.Forensic anthropologist Dr.Matt Lowell and his team of grad students don’t go looking for death—it usuallycomes to them. But when one of Matt’s students suspects the skeleton hanging ina top competitor’s lab is actually from a murder victim, Matt has no choice butto sneak in to confirm a suspicious death. Once the case comes to MassachusettsState Police Trooper Leigh Abbott, the team is back together again.While trying to handle thenew murder case, Matt and Leigh also uncover new evidence behind the mysteriousdeliveries intended to smear the name of Leigh’s father, an honored cop, fallenin the line of duty four years before. When the person behind the deliveries isfinally uncovered, it becomes clear that lives are in jeopardy if they attemptto thwart him. At the same time, as the murder case delves into undergroundsocieties and grows complicated when the killer himself becomes a victim, itwill take all of Matt and Leigh’s teamwork to solve both cases and escape withtheir lives.My verdictLament the Common Bones is the fifth in the Abbott and Lowell Forensic Mysteries series. The first three books in this series were the first three novels I ever reviewed on this blog in December 2014/January 2015. You can find the links below. Then I reviewed the fourth book in February 2015 - the link is below too.Reading Lament the Common Bones was like coming back to old friends I haven't seen for a while. I easily slipped back into the characters' lives, with everything falling into place straight away. I remembered the sizzling chemistry between Matt Abbott and Leigh Lowell - and how much I loved all of the characters in the books, including Matt's team of grad students who have their own distinctive quirks and traits.Although I've mentioned this is the fifth in the series, I do believe that you could read this easily as a standalone as you don't need back story to understand and appreciate the depth of the writing. The fast-paced plot is an intriguing and complex one. A skeleton hanging in a forensics lab seems to be from a murder victim, but how did it get there and why? Meanwhile, Leigh is receiving mysterious deliveries, suggesting her deceased father was a dirty cop - is someone trying to frame him?I'm still loving this series three years on. It's definitely a worthy rival to Kathy Reich and Patricia Cornwell, who are often thought of as the queens of forensic crime fiction. The Abbott and Lowell series is new, fresh, exciting and interesting, with forensics explained clearly without detracting from the plot. I'm hoping there's still more to come.To read my reviews of the previous books, click on the links below:http://off-the-shelfbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/dead-without-stone-to-tell-it.htmlhttp://off-the-shelfbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/no-one-sees-me-til-i-fall.htmlhttp://off-the-shelfbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/a-flame-in-wind-of-death.htmlhttp://off-the-shelfbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/two-parts-bloody-murder.html"},

Vaseem Khan's Inspector Chopra & the Million Dollar Car and Mark Billingham's Cut Off. These are two very different reads and both are brilliant! I'm now going to buy the others!Vaseem Khan's Inspector Chopra & the Million Dollar Car (published by Mulholland Books) is a fun cosy crime novel set in India.

After Louise loses her phone in a local cafe, she's relieved when someone gets in touch to return it.

AUTHORSPatriciaHighsmith is the author I keep returning to for the psychological precision ofher work and the confidence of her prose. There might not be better forexplorations of obsession and envy, the proximity of love and hate and just howdevastating that proximity can be. I reread the Ripley novels every couple ofyears but her non-Ripley books contain some gems too. The Tremor of Forgery isoddly underrated and deserves a look, also her non-crime novel Edith’s Diarywhich is perfect for fans of domestic noir.... FILMS/MOVIESDie Hard.All of them, except the last one, even Die Hard 4 has plenty to recommend it.‘You just killed a helicopter with a car!’ – that’s the kind of line I want ina crime film. Though they’re maybe more action than crime by that point theoriginal stands as a great example of what a cop can do with no shoes, a sweatyvest and a really smart mouth.... TV DRAMASSneaky Peteis one of those shows that I totally loved but nobody I mention it to has seen.Marius is a con man who, on being released from prison, needs a place to lielow so assumes the identity of his former cellmate and insinuates himself intothe man’s long estranged family. Little does he know that they have a fewrackets of their own on the go. Bryan Cranston – who also co-wrote it – is anoily casino owner, Margo Martindale is a star as a savvy bailbondswoman, andGiovanni Ribissi turns in a brilliantly twitchy and often surprisinglyemotional performance. It’s at the lighter end of the crime spectrum, warmhearted and very funny, but that only makes the moments of brutality even moreeffective. One to binge.... FICTIONAL KILLERSClytemnestrain Colm Toibin’s The House of Names is the killer who stayed with me from2017’s reading. Based on an ancient Greek tragedy it’s the story of a king,Agamemnon, who lures his family away from their safe home with the promise of agood marriage for his daughter Iphigenia, only to sacrifice her to the gods, inhopes that they’ll reward him by improving the weather and allowing him to sailinto battle. Toibin flips the classic narrative by telling the story from theremaining family member’s points of view, rather than the triumphant king's andin so doing creates a devastating portrait of a grieving mother who doesn’tshare her husband’s belief in the gods and realises that the sacrifice was toappease his army and maintain his position of power. We see Clytemnestra slowlyand determinedly plotting her revenge, one it’s very easy to understand andsupport and for that reason she is a fascinating fictional killer, one of thevery few I’ve found myself rooting for. While this isn’t strictly a crime novelit springs from a tradition which laid down many of the narratives writers arestill riffing on thousands of years later. Definitely a book for crime readersto try. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES It’s alwaysgoing to be Rebus. They were the first detective novels I read and the oneswhich made me want to be a crime writer. Here’s a bolshy, gobby, fighty bloke amillion miles away from Miss Marple and all the genteel English crime novels Icouldn’t get into at the time. Ian Rankin’s books laid down a template that aworking class crime writer could follow.... MURDER WEAPONSThe one Ican’t forget and which makes me eye the author with suspicion even now, is thenewspaper used in Craig Robertson’s debut, Random. What kind of sick mind wouldconsider rolling up a paper and shoving it down someone’s throat to choke themto death? I’m gagging just thinking about it.    ... DEATH SCENESIt’s nearimpossible to do this without giving away a massive spoiler and the film is fartoo good for me to risk ruining it for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. ButMartin Sheen’s character in The Departed dies a death which flips everythingwe’ve seen up until that point and made me full on gasp. Brilliant writing.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESIs anywebsite more useful that Wikipedia? Google maps... WRITING TIPSRead badbooks. You’ll learn as much by seeing what not to do as you will by studyingthe very best writing looking for tips. You’ll also feel a lot better aboutyour own work. This one is particularly useful when suffering from writer’sblock. Just don’t try it with wildly successful but badly written novels,because that’s depressing.... WRITING SNACKSI’m prettymuch cigarettes and espresso when I’m writing but the one bit of food I’ll eatis this amazing Indian chocolate with coconut from Waitrose 1 range.

I wanted to shout about the issues it raised and share my enjoyment of the book and my admiration for the author. Yet first of all I needed some time to think and process everything I had read.While this is a psychological thriller, it's also so much more than this. I can't say much about the plot without giving anything away. But it is complex and intelligent, filled with social and political conscience and some highly topical and ethical contemporary themes. It is bang up to date, focusing on the plight of the underdog against the big property developers. The writing is stunning, drawing the reader in. This is a masterclass with its multi-layered plotting, realistic characters and twists that actually work.I don't think I've ever been so invested in a book's characters before, shaken and shocked by events as they unfolded right until the bitter end. This is a powerful twisty thought-provoking read and one I won't forget easily - if at all. It's also a book that people will be talking about for a long time, as anger, compassion and frustration ooze off every page.Eva Dolan is a force to be reckoned with. This is How it Ends is her best novel yet - a book that will challenge you and leave you reeling."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Kate Rhodes", "date": "Thursday 25 January 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome KATE RHODESto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSI thinkthat one of the very best crime authors right now is Erin Kelly. Erin was ajournalist before becoming a crime novelist and her experience of conveyingcomplex information from multiple perspectives really enriches her writing. Ilove the way her beautifully layered plots flick easily between differentcharacters’ viewpoints and time zones. There’s a tremendous black wit in hernovels such as The Poison Tree too.Her latest crime novel, He Said, She Said,is a brilliant statement about how much damage our flawed memories can do, andexplores some of the darkest areas of sexual politics. I was absolutelythrilled that Erin wrote a kind review of my first novel, because I’m a hugefan of her writing and always pre-order her books. ... FILMS/MOVIESPsycho. Even though more than fifty years have passedsince Hitchcock directed this crime classic, it still sends shivers down myspine. There’s something particularly appalling about the way Antony Perkinsswitches so easily from naïve, fresh-faced sweetness to the apotheosis of evil.The shower scene with its screaming violin still has the power to inducenightmares, despite all the parodies and spoofs that followed. ... TV DRAMASHinterland is one of my favourite crime drama series, andI’m thrilled to see that it has been optioned for another series. It draws onsome of the darkest aspects of Scandinavian thriller series like Wallander, which translate perfectly tothe beautiful but bleak Welsh countryside. I really like the way the charactersswitch between languages, reminding me of the beauty of the Welsh language. Stunningplots and performances form the entire cast lift Hinterland to a higher level than most recent crime drama for me. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibalLecter is my favourite villain. I adore Thomas Harris’s writing, and his cannibalistickiller in Silence of the Lambs is farmore subtle on the page than the big screen. The literary version of Lecterinterests me far more than the bloodthirsty celluloid one, because he iscapable of love, remorse, and ultimately of redemption. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES John Rebus ismy favourite literary detective. I’m a huge Ian Rankin fan, and I’ve been loyalto his great crime series from book one. I love reading (and writing) crimeseries, because the fictional characters become as familiar as relatives. I canimagine John Rebus arriving at my house for Christmas dinner, drunk, and in abad mood from his latest attempts to solve a crime. When Rankin finally layshim to rest, I will go into mourning. ... MURDER WEAPONSI’m a bigfan of Patricia Cornwell’s Kay Scarpetta novels which provide some of the mostintriguing murder weapons ever. In UnnaturalExposure, Scarpetta has to go up against a killer who uses deadly diseasesto kill his victims, rather than standard weapons. There’s somethingparticularly horrifying about a killer who’s prepared to use a smallpox vaccineto kill his victim, putting the whole population at risk.     ... DEATH SCENESThe mostmemorable death scene is by one of my great heroes, Graham Greene. Spoileralert! If you haven’t read his most famous novel, Brighton Rock, look away now… The book ends with seventeen year-oldgang leader Pinkie Brown getting his face splashed with vitriol, thenplummeting to his death from a clifftop. Pinkie is such a malevolent character,that despite his youth, his death comes as a relief, and Greene portrays hisagonies as a just retribution for all the lives he’s taken with great panache.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESTheinternet site I’ve been looking at most recently is actually a web cam, sitedat Ruin Beach on the Scilly island of Tresco. http://www.camsecure.co.uk/Ruin_Beach_Cafe.html My new HELL BAY crime series is set on the Scillies, and it’s a ten hourjourney from my home in Cambridge to reach the islands. But when I need toremember exactly what the landscape looks like, it feels like I’m standing onthe shore again, watching the Atlantic tide roll in. ... WRITING TIPSMy mostimportant writing tip is never give up! I attended several brilliant writingcourses run by the Arvon Foundation when I was dreaming of writing my firstnovel, and one the best lessons I learned was the need for persistence. Manypeople complete that all-important first draft, but give up when it comes toediting and polishing their work. Stick with it, and remind yourself you have agreat story to tell. ... WRITING SNACKSNuts are mynibble of choice. I keep a big bowl of them on my desk, so when hunger strikes,I’ll snack on almonds, pecans and cashews. I used to eat truckloads ofchocolate biscuits, so my new snack feels quite virtuous. And I suppose it’s afitting snack for an author, really.

This February (9th to 11th) will see 85 of Central andGreater London’s bookshops offering special events, discounts and perks tobookshop crawlers. Sharing book loveThe event was founded by book blogger Bex Hughes, who says“the idea of the London Bookshop Crawl is joy: celebrating the joy of books,the wonder of bookshops and the often unique experience of buying books withothers who also love them and fully support the acquisition of far too many.London has so many bookshops and we wanted a way to help people to discoverthem, meet each other and have lots of fun doing so.”Bookshop Crawls visited Bath in 2016 and Oxford in 2017. Bex is an ex-Londoner and wanted to explore the smaller London bookshops as well, rather than just the large ones like Waterstones Piccadilly and Foyles. “The core of the event is passion for supportingindependent bookshops,” she says. “I personally feel that they are one of themost important resources and by supporting them we are supporting local communitiesand encouraging literacy. In 2018, we'll be running two summer crawls – oneNorth and one South.” How to join inDuring the weekend of 9th to 11th February, there will be guided tours led by knowledgeable bookworms, authorevents, special tours and many other fun things alongside the special perksbeing offered by the bookshops themselves. Tickets are still available for Richmond &Kew London Bookshop Crawl on February 10th.

{"title": "The Confession by Jo Spain", "date": "Wednesday 24 January 2018", "text": "The ConfessionBy Jo SpainPublished by Quercus (25 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionLate one night a man walks into the luxurious home ofdisgraced banker Harry McNamara and his wife Julie. The man launches anunspeakably brutal attack on Harry as a horror-struck Julie watches, frozen byfear. Just an hour later the attacker, JP Carney, has handedhimself in to the police. He confesses to beating Harry to death, but JP claimsthat the assault was not premeditated and that he didn't know the identity ofhis victim. With a man as notorious as Harry McNamara, the detectives cannothelp wondering, was this really a random act of violence or is it linked to oneof Harry's many sins: corruption, greed, betrayal?My verdictThe Confession is a whydunnit rather than a whodunnit. We know from the start who beat Harry McNamara to death, as JP Carney has confessed to the crime, but this is very much the psychology behind the incident and a look into the lives of the people involved.The book is well written and compelling with realistic characters and a chilling plot. The narrative switches between Harry's wife Julie, Alice (the detective investigating the crime) and JP. The description of the attack is vivid and violent, setting the scene for a gritty psychological thriller with plenty of depth. I was intrigued from the start and wasn't sure which way the book was going.Secrets were clearly bubbling underneath the surface. I wondered if there were links between the main characters, though I had no idea how, what or why - or whether maybe I was just reading into everything too much, which is so easy to do with psychological thrillers. Then gradually the layers were unpicked one by one, like a game of Jenga, and the blocks came tumbling down, revealing the truth. My feelings for the characters changed as I delved into their lives - a sign of great writing, great characterisation and great plotting.The Confession is a book of revenge and betrayal, family secrets and tragedy. It's filled with twists and turns. Surprising and intriguing - a book that was hard to put down. Highly recommended!"},

{"title": "Coming Home to Island House by Erica James", "date": "Monday 22 January 2018", "text": "Coming Home to Island HouseBy Erica JamesPublished by Orion (11 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy through the Lovereading Readers' Panel.Publisher's descriptionIt's the summer of 1939, and after touring an unsettledEurope to promote her latest book, Romily Temple returns home to Island Houseand the love of her life, the charismatic Jack Devereux. But when Jack falls ill, his estranged family are calledhome and given seven days to find a way to bury their resentments and cometogether. With war now declared, each member of the family isreluctantly forced to accept their new stepmother and confront their ownshortcomings. But can the habits of a lifetime be changed in one week? And canRomily, a woman who thrives on adventure, cope with the life that has been sounexpectedly thrust upon her?My verdictI smiled my way through Coming Home to Island House, with its uplifting writing and gentle humour. Not many books give me a warm feeling inside, but this one certainly did.Author Romily Temple, who is used to leading an independent adventurous lifestyle, and her dysfunctional stepfamily are thrown together unexpectedly after Romily's husband Jack falls ill. His family have grown apart over the years. Not only do they not know Jack married Romily but they hadn't even met her - so this is a shock when they arrive.  Each member of the family is very distinctive, with their own little quirks and beliefs, creating a diverse array of characters. It's their diversity that keeps this story flowing, as they learn to accept one another for who they are - and as Romily copes with her new role in life.This book is about family dynamics and sibling relationships but also political uncertainty at a time of war. The story takes place mainly in the UK, but also covers the situation in Germany and Italy, highlighting the plight of Jews as the Nazi movement rises in Europe. In many ways, the book's theme is war itself - between family members and also countries - and the impact it has on people's lives.I highly recommend Coming Home to Island House if you're looking for an easy read - perfect for cold winter nights with a mug of hot chocolate at your side. Go on... treat yourself!"},

All young. All attractive. All dead. 'It is a lot of dead girls.And it's a very small island.'AN ATMOSPHERIC NEW CRIME SERIES SET IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDSFollowing a traumatic incident in London, Jennifer Dorey hasreturned to her childhood home in Guernsey, taking a job as a reporter at thelocal newspaper. After the discovery of a drowned woman on a beach, sheuncovers a pattern of similar deaths that have taken place over the past fiftyyears.Together with DCI Michael Gilbert, an officer on the verge ofretirement, they follow a dark trail of island myths and folklore to 'Fritz',the illegitimate son of a Nazi soldier. His work, painstakingly executed, hasso far gone undetected. But with his identity about to be uncovered, the killer nowhas Jennifer in his sights.My verdictThe Devil's Claw is an atmospheric murder mystery in a claustrophobic Channels Islands setting.I found this to be an intelligent read with plenty of history at its heart. The book is set in a close-knit town where strangers are noticed, yet murders have remained unsolved (and even covered up) for 50 years, considered to be 'drowning by suicide' instead. The narrative switches between journalist Jennifer, police officer Michael and the yet-to-be-revealed killer. Plenty of twists and turns kept me guessing right until the end.I learnt a lot about Guernsey - not only in terms of its culture and history, but also about the people who live there. I even found myself Googling local legends and folklore to learn more. I have never visited the Channel Islands thought it's on my bucket list - and the author's stunning descriptive prose of the landscape and landmarks made me even more determined to make sure I get there one day.I particularly love books with a journalist as the main protagonist, as long as they are portrayed realistically (journalists tend to get a lot of bad press). I found that Jennifer ticked all the boxes in terms of her inquisitive nature, inner strength and also vulnerability. Jennifer and Michael are both well-developed characters and I'm interested to see how they continue to develop in the next book.The Devil's Claw not only entertained and intrigued me but also improved my knowledge of the world. An enjoyable debut."},

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome HARRIET STILESMarketing and Author Relations ManageratAmazon Publishing UKWhat and when was your first job in publishing?I got my start in the publishing industry here at AmazonPublishing after spending several years in the Amazon marketing team. Combiningmy marketing experience with my love of books seemed like the perfect fit! Inmy role as Marketing and Author Relations Manager, I’m able to work closelywith our Thomas & Mercer and 47 North authors, supporting them fromacquisition through to publication and beyond. My role is designed to assistauthors every step of the way as at Amazon Publishing, our title promotions areongoing. I feel privileged to have a role which focuses 100% on our authors. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I joined the Amazon UK publishing team in 2015. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I’m currently engrossed in some brilliantly nail-bitingthrillers coming out this year such as SilentVictim by Caroline Mitchell and TheRetreat by Mark Edwards. Mark and I had a great meeting recently – it’swonderful to sit down with an author and talk through plans for their book,discussing the different ideas we have for promoting it. A proper workinglunch! Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?During my studies at Edinburgh, I devoured the Classicswhich cemented my love of literature and reading. Being at university is a goodway to learn how to prioritise, manage workload and meet deadlines – definitelyhelpful in my job!  Living abroad inItaly as part of my degree also helped in building confidence talking to newpeople. Meeting authors for the first time can be daunting but luckily allthose I’ve worked with at Amazon Publishing have been lovely. How do you relax after a busy working day?I love a good yoga class! Dynamic or relaxing, depending onmy mood. What was the last book you read for pleasure?I have to read a lot of manuscripts but they don’t reallyfeel like work! The most recent book I’ve read which wasn’t published by AmazonPublishing was Brat Farrar , a 1940scrime novel by Josephine Tey. It’s fascinating to see how crime fiction hasevolved over the last 70 years. I was particularly interested as I work with alot of crime writers. Describe your job in 15 words or less...My #1 priority is to ensure that our authors are happy andhave the best possible publishing experience. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farIt’s always a thrill when an author I’ve been working withreaches some kind of milestone. Mark Edwards, for example, has just hit the 2million mark which is hugely exciting. Acquiring talented new authors is wonderfultoo – I can’t give any details right now but watch this space! If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I’ve actually just returned from a 3-month sabbatical. Itravelled to South East Asia which was incredible. I’m lucky that AmazonPublishing offers opportunities for employees such as sabbaticals – it’s one ofthe perks of working here. I’d love to accompany an author on a research tripfor a new book – that would definitely be combining business with pleasure. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?The Amazon Publishing team move fast once a businessdecision is made and I’m constantly challenged and learning new things. Becauseof these factors, I’d say Girl on anExpress Train!   Thanks so much for taking part, HARRIET!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},

AUTHORSSharonBolton. I read Blood Harvest first and loved Sharon’sstyle of writing and so searched for her other novels. I went back to herfirst, Sacrifice, and after thatbegan the Lacey Flint series. Her writing draws me in and the tight plottingand clever twists keep me reading.... FILMS/MOVIESDifficultto pin down to one film! I will choose MinorityReport, though, because I can watch it again and again. I love the conceptof this film and the PreCrime Department that deals with bringing in thecriminal before they’ve committed the crime. Brilliantly done, highlyentertaining. Love it! ... TV DRAMASNow this is hard as there have been loads ofgreat crime-based TV shows. Happy Valleyis a popular choice and I thought it was fantastic viewing, and the firstseries of Broadchurch almostdestroyed me – I binge-watched the series, it was compelling viewing. But, I’llchoose Line of Duty for the ‘best ofcrime’ – I came to the series late and watched the second before the first, butI was drawn in completely by the characters and storyline. Keeley Hawes wasamazing in this. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI usuallythink of Hannibal Lecter as my favourite killer (that sounds very wrong!) But Ifeel he’s had enough exposure, so I think it has to be Joe Carroll from The Following – he is devious,manipulative, yet a charmer. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Again,there are lots of great fictional detectives, but I have to choose Sherlock.He’s just so clever and the way his mind works tops all the other detectives! ... MURDER WEAPONSA pencil! Thescene from Dark Knight was short butto the point (see what I did there?) It was kind of horrifying and made mewince, but great all the same!     ...

AUTHORSTo paraphrase Frank Sinatra, this is a case of ‘too many to mention’, but let’s give it a go. Greats like Ruth Rendell and Ian Rankin (of course). Lisa Jewell and Alex Marwood are more recent favourites, and I’m expecting great things from Emily Koch based on her fantastic debut If I Die Before I Wake.... FILMS/MOVIESI love the 1998 film A Perfect Murder, starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. A stylish and elegant reworking of the equally impressive Dial M for Murder. And alongside that the absolutely outstanding The Long Good Friday, one of my all-time favourite films in any genre, with perhaps the most gruesomely realistic murder scene I’ve ever seen on screen.... TV DRAMASAnother embarrassment of riches. Old favourites like Waking the Dead, Law & Order, and Between the Lines (anyone else remember that?), and some outstanding new kids on the block – Line of Duty, True Detective I, Mindhunter, Motive, Broadchurch, Hinterland….... FICTIONAL KILLERSIf you force me to choose it would be Tom Ripley, from the Patricia Highsmith novels, brought superbly to life by Matt Damon. Cold, clever, and psychologically complex *shivers*.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Can I have Inspector Morse?  Though I confess I do rather prefer him on screen to on page! For someone writing crime fiction set in Oxford I can hardly avoid bumping into him at every turn. But hey, that’s a high-class problem to have.... MURDER WEAPONSHas to be from that marvellous Roald Dahl Tale of the Unexpected, where the woman bludgeons her husband with a frozen leg of lamb then cooks it for the policemen who turn up to investigate. Hilarious!    ... DEATH SCENESI’m going to be a bit contrary here and go for the murder scene that turned out not to be one at all – the ‘death’ Amy Dunne counterfeits to incriminate her husband in Gone Girl. Such a clever idea – one of those you wish you’d thought of yourself.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI love Dead Good and Crime Time as a way to keep up with what’s going on in the crime world.  There are also some fantastic sites out there on subjects like forensic pathology. Not for the fainthearted but invaluable to help you get your facts right.... WRITING TIPSI’m someone who writes really detailed synopses before I start. I think that with crime in particular, it’s almost impossible to do it any other way. You have to know who did it and why, and ensure there are enough other possible explanations that the reader doesn’t get to the answer too quickly. So my practical tip would be to plan, plan, and plan again. The other is more of an ‘emotional’ tip, and that’s to grow as thick a skin as you can. This business is always a rollercoaster and there will inevitably be lows as well as highs, so toughen up, but don’t give up!... WRITING SNACKSI am very partial to fruit toast. And chocolate. Always chocolate…About CARA HUNTERCara Hunter is a writer who lives in Oxford, in a street not unlike those featured in her series of crime books. Close to Home is her debut featuring DI Adam Fawley, and her second, In the Dark, will be published in July.Find Cara Hunter on Twitter - @CaraHunterBooksAbout CLOSE TO HOMEPublisher's descriptionHOW CAN A CHILD VANISH WITHOUT A TRACE? Last night, 8-year-old Daisy Mason disappeared from a summer party at her home.

{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Sophie Orme", "date": "Thursday 11 January 2018", "text": "Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome SOPHIE ORMEEditorial DirectoratBonnier ZaffreWhat and when was your first job in publishing?After a painfully expensive MA in Creative Writing I wasvery keen to get into publishing (following an aborted attempt a couple ofyears before) but couldn’t afford to do work experience. I was temping at arecruitment firm when a job came up as a PA to the Sales and Marketing Directorat Pan Macmillan. I put myself forward for it, as well as having to find otherpotential candidates (!) Luckily the interview went well and I got it. A coupleof years later, I moved to a role in the editorial department, working for the Mantleimprint. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I joined Bonnier Zaffre as Editorial Director in March last year. Before that I spent ten years at Pan Macmillan (most of which was at Mantle)and six months at Scribner, Simon & Schuster in a maternity cover role. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I have a very varied list to look after – from thrillers toreading group fiction – which I love. I’ve inherited several fantastic authorsfrom my predecessor Joel Richardson including bestsellers such as James Swallowand T. M. Logan and I’ve brought a few authors to the list now, too. I am superexcited to have just acquired Stacey Bartlett’s amazing debut novel The Familiars following a nine publisherauction. My editing pile is teetering at the moment, but among the books I needto attend to are an incredible ghost story I haven’t yet announced (watch thisspace) and a brilliant and very timely thriller: The Dangerous Kind by Deborah O’ Connor. Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?From the start I was focused on becoming an editor and,while working in the sales and marketing department at Pan Macmillan, persistentin meeting people and offering editors help in reading submissions and tacklingtheir editing backlogs. While of course working hard and learning everythingyou can about the industry is very important, persistence and confidence inyourself are probably the most important things, particularly when you are an‘outsider’ – someone without connections. Publishing is incredibly competitiveand filled with extremely talented people – finding a new role is as much aboutbeing in the right place at the right time as it is your skills and qualifications,so you have to keep pushing and try not to let rejections get you down. How do you relax after a busy working day?I have a toddler, so much of my spare time isn’t veryrelaxing (!) but she is an enormous amount of fun. When she’s asleep (and I’mnot reading author deliveries or submissions or answering e-mails) I wind downby watching Corrie or a period drama (currently Alias Grace which is fantastic). At weekends I love to go for walksor bike rides on the Walthamstow marshes, then going for a pub lunchafterwards. What was the last book you read for pleasure?I don’t have as much time for reading for pleasure sincehaving my daughter, but I picked up TheSilent Companions by Laura Purcell for my Christmas break.Describe your job in 15 words or less...I’m a curator, polisher and champion of great fiction. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farWinning the auction for TheFamiliars is definitely up there! I also absolutely loved working with KateMorton and, all too briefly, the incredible Elizabeth Jane Howard. It’s allabout the people in this industry, from the brilliant authors to my fantasticcolleagues. If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I genuinely can’t think of anything else I’d like to do. Ihad a brief period freelance editing at home earlier this year and missed thebuzz of the publishing world hugely. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Perhaps something like ‘Keep on swimming’! Publishing – justlike writing and being published – is a marathon rather than a sprint. Therewill be very tough times as well as wonderful ones and persistence and a bit ofself-belief will get you a long way.  Thanks so much for taking part, Sophie!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},

{"title": "Hydra by Matt Wesolowski", "date": "Tuesday 9 January 2018", "text": "HydraBy Matt WesolowskiPublished by Orenda Books (15 January 2018)Publisher's descriptionBefore Scarfell Claw, therewas Hydra… One cold November night in 2014, in a small town in the north westof England, 26-year-old Arla Macleod bludgeoned her mother, father and youngersister to death with a hammer, in an unprovoked attack known as the 'MacleodMassacre'. Now incarcerated at a medium-security mental-health institution,Arla will speak to no one but Scott King, an investigative journalist, whose‘Six Stories’ podcasts have become an internet sensation. King finds himselfimmersed in an increasingly complex case, interviewing five witnesses and Arlaherself, as he questions whether Arla’s responsibility for the massacre was adiminished as her legal team made out. As he unpicks the stories, he findshimself thrust into a world of deadly forbidden ‘games’, online trolls, and themysterious Black-eyed Children, whose presence extends far beyond the delusionsof a murderess…  My verdictMatt Wesolowski's Six Stories was one of my favourite reads in 2017. In my review, I wrote 'an eerie spine-tingling read.It's unpredictable and chilling and kept me guessing all the way through. Idon't scare easily, but certainly found this book unsettling.'Having just read Hydra, I can easily repeat those words again. Hydra is just as creepy and chilling - a perfect mix of crime, horror and supernatural - and just as unsettling. It follows the same brilliant format as Six Stories - six linked podcasts investigating a cold case (the Macleod Massacre). Investigative journalist Scott King interviews six different witnesses, including Arla Macleod herself - now held in a medium-security mental health institution. This a whydunnit rather than a whodunnit. Why did 21-year-old Arla Macleod brutally slaughter her parents and sister in an unprovoked attack? There seemed to be no doubt that she was the killer, but what led to the events of that fateful day? Will new evidence by these witnesses shed any light on the case? The investigation becomes personal when Scott King attracts the attention of an online troll.As with Six Stories, Hydra felt very real, reading like the transcript of a documentary. I love how the author switches so easily between the different voices of the characters and the natural rhythm of their dialogue. I found myself 'googling' references to see whether they were fact or fiction as I really wasn't sure. This book reveals the dark side of teenage obsessive behaviour - do you really know what your teenagers are up to behind their locked doors?Hydra is yet another powerful novel from Matt Wesolowski, the second book in his Six Stories series. It reads like classic crime, but with a modern twist. I'm hoping there will be more."},

The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome JENNY QUINTANAAUTHOR OF THE MISSING GIRLTO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITFOR HER BLOG TOURThe Missing Girl was published on 28 December 2017 by Mantle. My studyI’m luckybecause I have a room in the house which is mine. At least it’s supposed to bemine - school bags, shoes and musical instruments tend to drift in along withmembers of my family. The room is a short cut from the hall to the kitchen andas I feel guilty shutting my children out, I always let them in. The truth is Iwrite best when I’m alone in the house or early in the morning when everyoneelse is sleeping. I prefer to keep my desk tidy – although I don’t alwaysmanage that, and I like to have special things around me – ornaments andpictures which remind me of my family.Music… but onlysometimes. When I really want to get inside a character’s head and experiencewhat they’re feeling, I’ll go on YouTube, find an emotional song and play itover and over. Part of The Missing Girlis set in the eighties so I listened to artists like Kate Bush and Siouxsie andthe Banshees. The rest of the time when I’m writing though, I need absolutesilence. Even a ticking clock or the fridge groaning away distracts me.Tea in my special mugsI drink alot of tea – PG Tips. I’m not keen on herbal or fruit tea.  When I’m writing, I have my tea in a writingmug as I think it puts me ‘in the zone’. My family knows how much I love theseand always buys me a new one for my birthday. My favourite is the AgathaChristie mug even though it’s chipped and faded now.SnacksWhen I’m writing,I might not have time to stop and cook, so I eat quick things like toast andmarmite. I also have a lot of fruit because it stops me from going after thechocolate and the crisps (although I make an exception for marmite crisps).Heading for the fruit bowl forces me to stand up and move which is no bad thingwhen you’re writing all day. I’m also quite partial to cheese strings.A glass of wineEarlyevening if I’m still writing, I’ll have a glass of wine – red or whitedepending on my mood, but I like Sauvignon Blanc and Rioja best.  If it’s only one glass, I can keep going. Inmy head, I’m writing better! If it’s more, it’s probably time to turn off thecomputer …Technology and softwareI use Wordand that’s about it. I have an old iPhone which my children are always tellingme I need to update – it works, I understand how to use it, so why change? I’mnot very technically minded and have only recently embraced Twitter. However, Ido really enjoy being on Twitter and especially meeting book people, so I haveto ration my time there. I’ll use it as a reward after I’ve been writing for aset amount of time.   BookshelvesBooks, books and more books. I love the shelves in my studyand when I’m feeling a bit stuck, I swivel around on my chair and stare at themfor inspiration. And as everyone knows you can’t write unless you read. A lotof my books are very old – from childhood or when I studied English atuniversity. Many of them are scribbled in with words underlined and pagesturned down. I’m not the kind of person to keep a book in perfect condition. Ilike it to feel read.The dogHector, ourborder collie, keeps me company. He also forces me to get off my chair and gooutside for a walk. I go to the gym too, but walking in the fresh air with Hectoris not only good exercise, it helps my brain work better. I like it best whenthe weather’s a bit moody. I like to sort out plot problems while I’m wanderingaround in the rain.THANKS FOR TAKING PART, JENNY!About Jenny QuintanaJenny Quintana grew up in Essex and Berkshire, beforestudying English literature in London.

WRITING TIPSI’m someone who writes really detailed synopses before Istart. I think that with crime in particular, it’s almost impossible to do itany other way. You have to know who did it and why, and ensure there are enoughother possible explanations that the reader doesn’t get to the answer tooquickly.

{"title": "Author catchup - Hendrik Groen", "date": "Thursday 4 January 2018", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for On the Bright Side, the second in the Hendrik Groen series. I read both books together, so here's a double review including The Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen 83 1/4 Years Old.Both books feature Hendrik Groen, a geriatric Adrian Mole living in a care home in Amsterdam. Hendrik tries to keep himself fit and healthy at the age of 83, taking regular walks and looking after his appearance and overall health. He's a calm, thoughtful and dignified man, determined to make the most of his life while he can.In The Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen 83 1/4 Years Old, the reader is introduced to the star of the series - Hendrik Groen - along with his friends and care home staff and peers. In an attempt to add excitement to his seemingly humdrum days and the lives of those around him, Hendrik and a group of friends create the Old-But-Not-Dead-Club - embarking on a series of 'adventures' (i.e. day trips) - to the horror of their peers and the staff in the care home. This book is set in 2013.In On the Bright Side, Hendrik returns once again, this time battling against the care home director. The Old-But-Not-Dead-Club is still going, with some new members and even more adventurous trips. This book is set in 2015, so there's a one-year gap between the two books. I enjoyed both books, but the original book (The Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen 83 1/4 Years Old) was definitely my favourite of the two. They are both bittersweet in terms of subject matter, with an often-philosophical look at life and the ageing process. The book covers the changing medical, physical, emotional and social needs as Hendrik and his friends get older - and the need for friendship and companionship.The books are easy to dip in and out of, as if I was genuinely reading someone's daily diary, snippet by snippet. Hendrik makes dry and witty observations of the people around him and also the world news at the time. The care home itself has a boarding school feel to it - with secret meetings, smuggled food and rule breaking. I enjoyed the adventures of Hendrik and his friends out of the care home and would have loved to read more about these.I didn't find everything amusing, I will admit, as some of the book made me feel quite sad - partly because it brought back memories of visiting family members in care homes over the years and partly because the subject matter isn't always easy, covering topics such as diabetes, dementia and the loss of loved ones. I also felt sorry for many of these elderly people (including Hendrik) who have been left in a care home without family and friends to visit them - a sad reality around the world, especially as the population ages.There is a TV series featuring Hendrik Groen in Holland - here's a link to the YouTube trailer (it helps if you speak Dutch - which I don't - but it certainly brought some characters to life).About the booksThe Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen 83 1/4 Years OldPublished by Penguin (Paperback - 13 July 2017)Publisher's descriptionMeet Hendrik Groen. Anoctogenarian in a care home who has no intention of doing what he's told, ordying quietly. To that end, he creates the Old-But-Not-Dead Club and with hisfellow members sets about living his final years with careless abandon. Suchanarchism infuriates the care home director but pleases Eefje, the woman whomakes Hendrik's frail heart palpitate. If it's never too late to have fun, thencan it ever be too late to meet the love of your life?On the Bright SidePublished by Penguin (Hardback - 11 January 2018)Publisher's descriptionChaos will ensue as 85-year-old HendrikGroen is determined to grow old with dignity: to rise up against the care homedirector.

He dreams of escaping the confinesof his care home and practising hairpin turns on his mobility scooter. Inspiredby his fellow members of the recently formed Old-But-Not-Dead Club, he vows toput down his custard cream and commit to a spot of octogenarian anarchy.But the care home's Director will not standfor drunken bar crawls, illicit fireworks and geriatric romance on her watch.The Old-But-Not-Dead Club must stick together if they're not to go gently intothat good night. Things turn more serious, however, when rumours surface thatthe home is set for demolition.

{"title": "Sweetpea by CJ Skuse", "date": "Wednesday 3 January 2018", "text": "SweetpeaBy CJ SkusePublished by HQ (2 November 2017)I bought the Kindle version with Audible narrationPublisher's descriptionThe last person who called me ‘Sweetpea’ ended up dead…I haven’t killed anyone for three years and I thought that whenit happened again I’d feel bad. Like an alcoholic taking a sip of whisky. Butno. Nothing. I had a blissful night’s sleep. Didn’t wake up at all. And foronce, no bad dream either. This morning I feel balanced. Almost sane, for once.Rhiannon is your average girl next door, settled with herboyfriend and little dog…but she’s got a killer secret.Although her childhood was haunted by a famous crime,Rhinannon’s life is normal now that her celebrity has dwindled. By day her jobas an editorial assistant is demeaning and unsatisfying. By evening shedutifully listens to her friend’s plans for marriage and babies whilst secretlymaking a list.A kill list.From the man on the Lidl checkout who always mishandles herapples, to the driver who cuts her off on her way to work, to the people whohave got it coming, Rhiannon’s ready to get her revenge.Because the girl everyone overlooks might be able to get awaywith murder…My verdictI think my #BookLove2017 banner for Sweetpea sums up my thoughts. This was the first audiobook I had listened to properly without reading the book first. And it was the perfect choice. I didn't have time to write a full review at the time, so felt compelled to create this banner instead, adding it to my #BookLove2017 tweets.Sweetpea is a devilishly dark comedy, filled with outrageous humour and some explicit descriptions. This is certainly not a book for the faint-hearted or easily offended. I loved every minute of it - and every word.I listened to the audiobook while I was out and about walking and had some very odd looks from passersby as I couldn't stop laughing! I have been known to read a Kindle while out walking but there was no way I could have read Sweetpea while on the move. I would have walked into every lamppost and every vehicle and would probably have been run over in the process.Rhiannon, the female serial killer protagonist, has such a distinctive compelling 'voice'. She's sharp, witty, sarcastic, highly critical of others (to the point of wanting most people dead) and a psychopath, which she readily admits in her head (though not to anyone out loud, obviously). I found myself rooting for Rhiannon, even though I really shouldn't do so, as she's certainly not a 'people person'.I loved all of the other characters too - even the ones I probably wasn't meant to love. I believe that this was a direct consequence of listening to the audiobook. While the words on the page were the same as the ones I listened to, Sweetpea was brought to life brilliantly by the narrator, Georgia Maguire. Georgia was perfect for the job, with her different voices and accents for every character. I had planned to listen to the whole audiobook but I switched to the Kindle version at around 70% because my listening time was more limited over the festive season. When I switched back to the Kindle version, it was Georgia's voices that I heard in my head.If you're looking for an audiobook equivalent of 'a book you can't put down', this is the one to choose! Sweetpea is unique and brilliant! It's also gruesome and disturbing! And I need more!!!"},
{"title": "Looking forward - no regrets ", "date": "Wednesday 27 December 2017", "text": "Just over a week ago, on the last night of the eight-day Jewish festival Chanukah (for more about that, click here), I listened to an amazing woman speaking at my local synagogue.Louise lost her sight at the age of 27, 13 years ago, brought on by brittle diabetes, a rare, severe and unpredictable form of the disease. Since then, she has had two kidney transplants. Her first was combined with a pancreas transplant - a very risky procedure, especially as these double transplants were still fairly new at the time. Her second transplant took place earlier this year.Louise is one of the most inspirational women I have ever listened to. Like many teenagers, she took risks with her health, which affected her existing diabetes and led to her sight loss. Soon after she lost her sight, determined to regain back her independence, Louise visited family in Australia. She took part in a special support programme for people who had lost their sight, and even learnt survival skills in the Outback.Louise talked about how technology helps her to enjoy her favourite things in life, including cooking and shopping. And how, despite her disabilities and the treatments she endures, she doesn't let anything hold her back. She climbs mountains, swims regularly, co-pilots a plane and lives independently with the help of her constant companion, guide dog Nemo.Louise's key message that evening was 'make the most of your talents. Whatever you can do, do it. Whatever you enjoy, do it. Don’t let anything hold you back'.This reminded me of the former headmistress of my sons’ school, who passed away suddenly in 2013, just before she was due to retire. She was a highly respected educator and believed that ‘every child is good at something and it is our job (as teachers) to find out what it is’.She helped to create a secondary school that has become one of the top-performing non-selective state schools in the country. But most importantly, she designed a school day to incorporate enrichments, which are extra-curricular opportunities during lesson time rather than as optional after-school activities. Students aged 11 to 14 have a choice of over 70 activities, including sports, arts, music, drama, meditation, fashion design, car mechanics, cookery, jewellery making, public speaking, film studies and charity work.So children who aren’t so academic, or have less interest in academic subjects, are given the opportunity to discover their own talents and interests.Why am I telling you all this?I set up Off-the-Shelf Books on 30 December 2014, with the aim of reviewing fiction, interviewing authors and sharing book love. It’s certainly been a rollercoaster three years, full of ups and downs. I’ve learnt so much about books, reading, publishing, social media and also people. So much has happened, prompting me to look back on the past. Wishing there were some things I could change.But no one can change what's already been. We can only steer towards our future.I always wanted to write crime fiction, from the moment I read the Secret Seven and Famous Five. I watched a post-mortem at the age of 16, then studied Biomedical Science at university, with plans to do a Forensics PhD. But I became side tracked and ended up in journalism - and fiction became just a dream. Until just over two years ago when, after years of writing the first chapters of various books, I started writing fiction with more commitment.I did write one book, but decided earlier this year to put it aside and work on something else - and to keep working on it until I feel it's 'right'. I am now over 77K words through the first draft, which means I'm nearly there - and then the long editing process begins. Writing isn't new to me, and nor is editing. I have been a health journalist/editor for over 20 years. But fiction is very different to my day job, putting some (or all) of 'me' on to the page.Over the years, I have written for various magazines and websites, and edited them too. Currently, one of my main roles is freelance health editor for Bupa. I wrote a book on children's allergies in 2009, and I’ve edited and contributed to several others over the years. In 2017, I signed a contract with a publisher to update a bestselling baby care book. The updated version of the book should be published in 2018. I am now looking out for similar work.A few weeks ago I was talking to someone about writing and life’s regrets - being proud of your achievements, finding your own talents and not letting anything stop you achieving your dreams. The person I spoke to said that it was time for me to look forward and to stop looking back. Time to grasp all opportunities - and time to create my own.I recently wrote some bookish new year resolutions and tweeted them, admittedly slightly tongue-in-cheek. But actually... reading them made me realise how much I want to achieve them.Over the last few weeks, I've created #BookLove2017 banners for some of my favourite reads this year, and I've had some lovely comments on my blog, through social media and via email.Now I’m wondering whether I could use my love of the creative arts for something more substantial, as a sideline to journalism, while still leaving time for me to write. I used to draw too, but haven't found the time to do it properly since my university days. I'll be looking for all opportunities, even if it's just a way to relax.Looking forward to 2018, I’m hoping that I’ll finish off this book I’m working on and do something with it, rather than hide it in a bottom drawer. That I’ll find opportunities for drawing or design. That I'll continue with some other bookish plans I've already put into place.

{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Helena Sheffield", "date": "Thursday 21 December 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome HELENA SHEFFIELDMarketing and Communications ManageratPenguin Random House AudioWhat and when was your first job in publishing?I started working at HarperCollins as a Sales Assistant in October2013, supporting the team who sell to independent bookshops. It was my firstjob out of University and I absolutely loved it. Working in Sales was notsomething I’d expected to start out doing, but it completely changed myperspective of the publishing industry and taught me a huge amount of valuableinformation about our relationships with booksellers which I still use today. Ialways make sure that my marketing is as sales-focused as possible, and I stilllove working with retailers.After a year in that role I became a Sales Executive,working with bigger retailers, and then I made the jump into Marketing as AvonBooks’ Digital Marketing Manager. I’m currently Marketing and CommunicationsManager for Penguin Random House Audio. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve only been in my current role for around six months andit’s been brilliant. I’ve always listened to audiobooks, ever since I was veryyoung, so being on the other side is fascinating. Audiobook production is a wholedifferent area of expertise to book publishing, and I’ve had to change the wayI approach marketing to ensure everything is about listening, rather thanreading. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?As I work across all audiobooks published by Penguin RandomHouse and the BBC, there’s quite a lot going on. I’ve recently put togethercampaigns for Philip Pullman’s The Book of Dust and Eddie Izzard’sautobiography, Believe Me (and trust me, you need to listen to that one), and Doctor Who audiobooks. Coming upin 2018 there’s some seriouslyexciting publishing that I can’t wait to start talking about very soon. There’salso a huge amount of much variety which makes marketing all these books a lotof fun. Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I studied English Literature at University but I certainlydon’t think that’s a ‘requirement’ for working in publishing. Where I reallydeveloped was through pushing myself out of my comfort zone and doing thingsoutside of study or work. I was Secretary of my University’s Creative WritingSociety which forced me to lead a team, I worked in a library which meant Ideveloped a good background knowledge of popular books and I’ve always strivento keep up hobbies such as dancing, making hats or learning Italian as I thinkthat, certainly in marketing, anything you do to keep learning and trying newthings might filter through into a great idea. Essentially, experience doesn’t have to come from an officejob: if you say ‘yes’ to new opportunities you can draw as much experience asyou need from those, and you’ll develop that unique approach to working thatemployers will be looking for!How do you relax after a busy working day?I do try! I’ve always done dance and I still do Ballroom andLatin dancing every week – I’m currently preparing for an exam, so whether youcall that relaxing I’m not sure…I also like to try as many classes as possible so that Ikeep learning – I’ve done Italian, cooking and hat making so far, and have juststarted yoga. I also happen to have a smallobsession with hats, which led to my book, The Art of Wearing Hats, publishingin 2016. I’ve just started working with a hat magazine that will launch in2018, and I’ll be writing the odd piece for them as well. What was the last book you read for pleasure?I read Sarah Waters’ TheNight Watch. I love historical fiction, and a lot of her books are set inLondon during the 20th century. The level of detail in them isextraordinary; I honestly suspect her of having a time machine because shemakes a forgotten London feel like you’ve been there. This book works backwardsthrough WW2 and is visceral, unforgettable, perfect. Describe your job in 15 words or less...I get people listening. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farWhile it wasn’t officially my publishing career, writing andreleasing The Art of Wearing Hatswith HarperCollins has to be the best moment. It’s not something I’d everexpected to do, and it’s something I’m very proud of.Other than that, when I was still at Avon we were nominatedfor Imprint of the Year in the 2017 Nibbies – this felt like a huge team effortas we’d all worked so hard to make the imprint the best it had ever been, andto be rewarded in that way was a wonderful outcome. I was on my own when Ifound out, and never have I wanted to speak to strangers more than that day… If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?Without question I’d want to try being a milliner. I followso many of them on Instagram and while I can only imagine how difficult it mustbe, it looks like the perfect life. Surrounded by hats all day … Being able tomake your own … Never having to worry about presents again?  Ideal.I also know from my few hat-making classes that I would notbe very successful. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?If You Want to Get Ahead, Wear a HatThis may sound like a push, but I do think hats have helpedme out from time to time… I first applied to the HarperCollins Graduate Schemeand was in a room with 100 other people, hoping desperately to be noticed. As Ihad nothing to lose, I kept my pale pink cloche hat on, and two years later I raninto someone from HR who remembered me from that day – purely because of thehat. So my ultimate tip? Hats are your secret weapon. Go forthand conquer.Thanks so much for taking part, Helena!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "Anything for Her by G.J. Minett", "date": "Wednesday 20 December 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Anything for Her by G.J. Minett. Anything for Her was published by Zaffre on 30 November 2017.Anything for HerBy GJ MinettPublished by Zaffre (30 November 2017)Publisher's descriptionYou'd do anything for the one that got away . . .wouldn't you?When Billy Orr returns home to spend time withhis dying sister, he bumps into his ex-girlfriend Aimi, the love of his life.He might not have seen her in eleven years, but Billy's never forgotten her.He'd do anything for her then, and he'd do anything for her now.When Aimi tells him that she wants to escape herabusive husband, Billy agrees to help her fake her own death. But is she stillthe Aimi that Billy remembers from all those years ago? Once Aimi disappears, Billy has to face thepossibility that perhaps she had different reasons for disappearing - reasonsthat might be more dangerous than she's led him to believe . . .Sometimes trusting the one you love is the wrong thing to do.My verdictAnything for Her is the author's third psychological thriller. I've read the first book, The Hidden Legacy, but not the second. The books are all standalones with new characters, so it doesn't matter if you haven't read either of the previous two.Billy Orr is a nice guy with a troubled past who has returned home to help his dying sister. He finds himself caught in a web of lies when he meets his ex-girlfriend Aimi and she asks him for a favour. I wanted to shout at him for being so naive as I wasn't convinced Aimi could be trusted. I figured it would end in disaster - and it certainly didn't go as Billy had expected.The narrative switches easily between past and present and also between the multiple voices. The writing is great, with lots of vivid descriptions of people and places. The plot is a twisty one, cleverly constructed, and the tension builds up gradually as the book progresses.Anything for Her certainly kept me guessing - I wasn't sure exactly where the plot was heading - or why - until the final pages. A great ending to a book of family secrets, past relationships and manipulative people.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "The Chalk Man by CJ Tudor", "date": "Monday 18 December 2017", "text": "The Chalk ManBy CJ TudorPublished by Penguin (11 January 2018)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionNone of us ever agreed on the exact beginning. Was it when we started drawing the chalk figures, or whenthey started to appear on their own? Was it the terrible accident? Or when they found the first body?In 1986, Eddie and hisfriends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days bikingaround their sleepy little English village and looking for any taste ofexcitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code; little chalk stickfigures they leave for one another as messages only they can understand. Butthen a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothingis ever the same.In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he'sput his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing asingle chalk stick figure. When it turns out that his friends got the samemessage, they think it could be a prank . . . until one of them turns up dead.That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out whatreally happened all those years ago.My verdictThe Chalk Man is a chilling murder mystery and an outstanding debut.This twisty crime novel was really creepy and tense, in terms of both setting and premise. Mysterious notes lead narrator Eddie to think back to his adolescent years when he and his friends used little chalk men figures as their secret code and then discovered a dismembered body. The narration switches seamlessly between Eddie on the cusp of adolescence and Eddie as an adult in the present day.The Chalk Man reads like a timeless 'old school' classic with an '80s vibe, yet the hint of horror and supernatural flavour give it a definite contemporary feel. I loved the '80s cultural references - I would be a similar age to Eddie and his friends if they were real (they felt it), so the nostalgia certainly took me back several decades. The writing was both atmospheric and vivid, getting right under my skin, and the dialogue was filled with dark humour.The Chalk Man was a book that I couldn't put down easily and one that I really enjoyed, right until the surprising and somewhat disturbing ending. Now I don't think I'll ever view a chalk man hastily scribbled on a pavement in quite the same way again.The Girlboss WorkbookBy Sophia AmorusoPublished by Portfolio Penguin (24 October 2017)Publisher's descriptionHot on the heels of the Netflix show based on #GIRLBOSS comes Sophia Amoruso's new workbook oftips, doodles and fill-in-the-blanks that will help women become their bestGirlboss yet. A graphic and whimsical guide filled with exercises,illustrations and plenty of scribble room, TheGirlboss Workbook isdesigned for both dreamers and doers. It invites you (hell, implores you) toget in there and mess it up. Revisit #GIRLBOSS's career wisdom and use it to draft yourideal cover letter, answer practice interview questions and reflect on, or evendraw, your mistakes and accomplishments.#GIRLBOSS startedas Sophia Amoruso's story, but TheGirlboss Workbook isyour story. Use this book as a diary, a mood board, a stress ball and a toolfor organizing and launching your wildest dreams. My verdictI'm not officially in the target age group of The Girlboss Workbook (the under-25s, probably, including older teenagers). But I think this is a fun resource for young women if they're looking for some motivation in changing career - or just starting out. I knew nothing about the Netflix show based on #GIRLBOSS or about the author Sophia Amoruso when the book arrived - though I have now done some research.This interactive journal contains lots of advice on achieving your hopes and dreams and starting your own business or getting a job. There are questionnaires to fill in, pages to doodle on or colour in and lists to write. There are also practical tips on working in offices (dealing with colleagues), savings accounts, coping with debt, managing your social life and much more.This very graphic book is a motivational and inspirational quick read - one that someone can dip in and out of for ideas. It's a great present for a teenage girl deciding what she wants out of life.Odd Girl OutBy Laura JamesPublished by Bluebird (6 April 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWhat do you do when you wake up in your mid-forties andrealize you've been living a lie your whole life? Do you tell? Or do you keepit to yourself?Laura James found out that she was autistic as an adult, aftershe had forged a career for herself, married twice and raised four children. Odd Girl Out tracks the year of Laura's life after shereceives a definitive diagnosis from her doctor, as she learns that 'different'doesn't need to mean 'less' and how there is a place for all of us, and it'snever too late to find it.Laura draws on her professional and personal experiences andreflects on her life in the light of her diagnosis, which for her explains someof her differences; why, as a child, she felt happier spinning in circles thanstanding still and why she has always found it difficult to work in places witha lot of ambient noise. Although this is a personal story, the book has a wider focustoo, exploring reasons for the lower rate of diagnosed autism in women and awide range of topics including eating disorders and autism, marriage andmotherhood.This memoir gives a timely account from a woman negotiatingthe autistic spectrum, from a poignant and personal perspective.My verdictLaura James, an experienced journalist, and a wife and mother, has written an informative memoir, as she comes to terms with her recent diagnosis of autism.As she reflects on her past, she explores what has led her to feel 'different' from others over the years - as a child, teenager and now adult. Things slot into place, yet bring up more questions and a need to discover how to cope in an ever-changing world. She also contemplates other aspects of her life too, such as adoption, marriage, motherhood and living with a chronic pain condition (Ehler-Danlos syndrome - EDS).I found Odd Girl Out fascinating - a chance to see autism from the 'inside', rather than the outside looking in. An insight into the thought processes, identity crises and the need to feel stable and safe. This isn't a fast-paced or exciting read. But it tells the reader how it is - following a year in Laura James' life - based on one woman's experiences.Odd Girl Out provides reassurance that being 'different' doesn't mean someone can't live a full life, both professionally and personally. Although this is memoir, it may also be a useful resource for adults going through similar diagnoses, parents of children on the autistic spectrum and anyone who just feels a need to learn more."},

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome KESHINI NAIDOOAssociate PublisheratBookoutureWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first job in publishing was actually on the retail side.Once I had completed my degree, I first worked at Waterstones in Leeds, thenmoved to London in the early 2000s to work at BCA, the mail order book club, asa buying assistant. I quickly moved to be the buyer for crime and thriller aswell as literary fiction (and erotica!) and running The Mystery and ThrillerGuild. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I have been working at Bookouture since 2014. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?Recently, I have been working on Angela Marsons’ latestinstalment in the bestselling D.I. Kim Stone series, Broken Bones, as well as complex, gripping and page-turningpsychological thrillers from Barbara Copperthwaite (Her Last Secret), KathrynCroft (Silent Lies) and Sarah Wray (Her Best Friend). I’m very excited to bepublishing Helen Phifer’s authentic, terrifying, police procedural, Dying Breath. It’s been a busy autumn…! Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?It’s somewhat of a cliché for people in publishing, butbeing a heavy book junkie since childhood has really helped my career. I’m gladthat all the time I spent reading instead of climbing trees paid off! I alwayscite my time as a bookseller as shaping my knowledge of what real peopleactually choose to pick up – which is often quite at odds with what is givennewspaper coverage. How do you relax after a busy working day?I’m a horror movie addict, so I spend my downtime watchingscary films and reading horror movie blogs! I love seeing live music and havebeen lucky enough to see Steely Dan and Robert Glasper (a jazz musician)recently. I also have two children and two kittens, so they definitely keep mebusy when I’m not working… What was the last book you read for pleasure?It’s not the last book I read, but I absolutely loved You Will Know Me by Megan Abbott. Her characterisation is just outstanding andalways sucks me in wholly. Describe your job in 15 words or less...I help authors get their books out to as wide a readershipas possible. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farI’ve been fortunate enough to work at two publishing juggernautsin their early days – I started at Avon (HarperCollins) before it launched in2007, which gave me a huge grounding in what it takes to launch a successfulcommercial book and Bookouture, which has grown into the leader in digitalpublishing in the last three years. I love the challenges of growing a companyand the satisfaction of seeing its successes. I’d also have to say that seeing Angela Marsons’ D.I. KimStone series go on to sell millions of copies has been another huge highlightof my career. And I was delighted to be named on the Bookseller Rising Starlist in 2017 (I feel a bit old to still be ‘rising’, but I’ll take thataccolade!). If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?Anyone who has seen me at karaoke will know this, but I’dlove to be a rapper for a day! Although I’m not sure my Northern tones wouldreally be suited to it… sadly! If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Lucky Girl. I feel really privileged every day towork at a job I love, with dynamic, creative, colleagues and fantasticallyinventive (and lovely!) authors. I get to discover new voices, and bring themto the reading public. And I get to read books! As part of my job!

I wanted to shout about the issues it raised and share my enjoyment of the book and my admiration for the author. Yet first of all I needed some time to think and process everything I had read.While this is a psychological thriller, it's also so much more than this. I can't say much about the plot without giving anything away. But it is complex and intelligent, filled with social and political conscience and some highly topical and ethical contemporary themes. It is bang up to date, focusing on the plight of the underdog against the big property developers. The writing is stunning, drawing the reader in. This is a masterclass with its multi-layered plotting, realistic characters and twists that actually work.I don't think I've ever been so invested in a book's characters before, shaken and shocked by events as they unfolded right until the bitter end. This is a powerful twisty thought-provoking read and one I won't forget easily - if at all. It's also a book that people will be talking about for a long time, as anger, compassion and frustration ooze off every page.Eva Dolan is a force to be reckoned with. This is How it Ends is her best novel yet - a book that will challenge you and leave you reeling."},
{"title": "Marie Gameson's Writing Toolkit", "date": "Tuesday 12 December 2017", "text": "WRITING TOOLKIT gives you an idea of an author's writing process through the tools they use. The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome MARIE GAMESONAUTHOR OF THE GIDDY CAREER OF MR GADD (DECEASED)TO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITFOR HER BLOG TOURThe Giddy Career of Mr Gadd (deceased) was published on 15 July 2017 by Salt Publishing. I’ll justsay straight off, that when it comes to a writer’s habits, I am the veryantithesis of a role model, as will become evident below.TimetableThat adviceyou get about having to write something each day, I think is rubbish. Very fewof us have writing as our full-time job, so we have to write when it isconvenient; for me that means weekends and holidays. I have written three booksthis way, and it suits me more than trying to crowbar 10 minutes of gritted-teethwriting time into each weekday evening.Where I writeBasically Iwrite anywhere that is reasonably quiet and where I can smoke. At home thismeans the garden or the ‘outhouse’ (a glorified conservatory, which mylong-suffering partner has kindly designated as anOK-to-smoke-if-you-keep-the-door-open zone). I wrote much of Mr Gadd in China, either at cafes or inthe garden of one particular hotel, where a sympathetic waiter would keep metopped up with wine or coffee whilst trying to stamp on the cockroaches whichwhizzed around my table as twilight turned to darkness.Unfortunatelythe ability to drink, smoke, have a WiFi connection and balance my lap-top arefar more important to me than the ergonomics of my situation in terms of whichposition is best for my neck/back/eyes. I figure I can sort out the physicalproblems down the gym some other time. PropsMount Gayrum, Golden Virginia, any non-oaky red wine, café latte and – most importantly– English Breakfast tea, served in a proper big mug rather than one of thosesilly cups where your index finger gets caught in the handle. For sustenance:lashings of almond butter and either marmite or honey.MusicSomestrange change happened to me between youth and middle-age, so that I turnedfrom someone who wouldn’t have dreamt of doing homework without The Stranglersplaying in the background to someone who really dislikes extraneous noise: TV,radio, music. My tinnitus has got a lot worse with age, but fortunately is soconstant that it rarely bothers me in the same way as does a TV on in the nextroom. Where I plotI go onlong walks to untangle the plot. If I am visiting my mother in Dorset, then theplots are played out on Maiden Castle – a wonderful massive iron age hillfort –and where I got the idea for Mr Gadd.As I do most of my writing in Suffolk I also walk along the river Deben. I amaware that I sometimes mutter to myself, so it is fortunate that I rarely meetdog-walkers who might be alarmed. I try and row at least twice a week as well –it isn’t so good for plotting, but it is essential for the soul. I would liketo think that I look contemplative and ethereal in the photo below.Social mediaI am fairlyhopeless at social media, and my only rule about it is to tell myself that‘tomorrow I will definitely post something’. I’m afraid that when someone tellsme I can arrange things so that a single tweet or post to Pinterest spawns apost to Instagram and Facebook and whatnot, I just hear ‘blah blah blah’. It isnot so much the technology (I have spent several decades in IT) as trying to dashoff something interesting without taking 3 weeks to think about it.I don’t useanything fancy when writing. I scribble notes and draw mindmaps on notepads anduse Word for my manuscript and Excel for plotting. As I have studiedscreenwriting rather than writing, I tend to plot the story using John Truby’s22 steps method of screenwriting. It gives a useful rough guide to the firstdraft.Havinghinted that I am competent at IT, I should go on to say that Windows 10 is myenemy, and that my darkest fantasies involve Microsoft employees, me, andvastly upscaled versions of the weapons in Cluedo. I use different PCs, an oldlaptop and a tablet – and I have watched each become more enfeebled after beingassaulted by various automatic Windows 10 updates. Sadly, my lovely SurfacePro, which I took to China twice to write and re-write Mr Gadd didn’t pull through the last update. I almost wept: Surface Pro 3 (deceased).THANKS FOR TAKING PART, MARIE!About Marie GamesonMarie Gameson was born inTrinidad but spent her childhood in Kuwait, El Salvador, and Barbados.

{"title": "Tattletale by Sarah J Naughton", "date": "Monday 11 December 2017", "text": "Tattletale By Sarah J NaughtonPublished by Trapeze (21 September 2017)I bought the paperback of this book, not realising I already had a digital Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalleyPublisher's descriptionOne day changes Jody's life forever. She has shut herselfdown, haunted by her memories and unable to trust anyone. But then she meetsAbe, the perfect stranger next door and suddenly life seems full of possibilityand hope.One day changes Mags's life forever. After years ofestrangement from her family, Mags receives a shocking phone call. Her brotherAbe is in hospital and no-one knows what happened to him. She meets his fiancéJody, and gradually pieces together the ruins of the life she left behind. Butthe pieces don't quite seem to fit...My verdictTattletale is a complex story of obsessional love, murder and revenge and is filled with secrets and lies.It took me a while to get into this psychological thriller, I admit, but once everything clicked into place I raced through it, even though it wasn't a comfortable read at times. The book is filled with suspense and covers some dark contemporary themes.Much of what happens occurs inside the character's heads, and there's also plenty of reading between the lines. Mags, Jody and Mira are all unreliable narrators, so it was difficult to know whether any of them could be trusted. I was intrigued to discover how Mags and Jody's pasts that led to the present day - and how early memories and events can shape children into the adults they become.Several other characters in the book are also harbouring secrets, which was heartbreaking in places. Clever plotting meant that there were several surprises (although I did guess some of the twists along the way), and one scene in particular made me gasp out loud. The tension built up to a dramatic ending and a satisfying conclusion.Two NightsBy Kathy ReichsPublished by William Heinemann (29 June 2017)I received a copy from the publisher but also bought my own copy at the author's London eventPublisher's descriptionMeet SundayNight, a woman with physical andpsychological scars, and a killer instinct ...Sunnie has spent years running from her past,burying secrets and building a life in which she needs no one and feelsnothing.But a girl has gone missing, lost in the chaosof a bomb explosion, and the family needs Sunnie’s help.Is the girl dead?Did someone take her?If she is out there, why doesn't she want to befound?It's time for Sunnie to face her own demons -because they might just lead her to the truth about what really happened allthose years ago.My verdictOften when you read a book by an author you know well, you know roughly what to expect. But Two Nights is very different from Kathy Reich's much-loved long-running Temperance Brennan series. I was very excited to discover that she had a new book with new characters. With the lead character having an unusual name like Sunday 'Sunnie' Night, I couldn't fail to be intrigued.Two Nights is fresh and different, written in a much more 'thrilling' writing style than the Brennan series. It's full of action so moves at a fast pace. Die-hard Brennan fans should prepare themselves for a very different reading experience - and also for one without all the forensic anthropology that they know and love. Although the plot is intriguing (about a missing girl), the book was very much a character-led one for me.Sunnie is a great character - damaged (physically and emotionally), yet fearless. She has many talents and isn't afraid to put her emotions first. She is funny and quick witted (as shown through her dialogue), with sharp observations of the world around her. Thanks to Sunnie's distinctive voice, Two Nights was a very quick read for me.Two Nights has been called a standalone. I'm not sure if this is the start of a new series, but would definitely like to know more about Sunnie and her past. The book hints that there is more to come - so now I'm waiting...Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome JAMES BUCKLERto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSI amcurrently obsessed by Martin Cruz Smith, and his series of novels featuring theRussian detective Arkady Renko. I had never come across the author until itturned out he had already used a title that I wanted for an early version of mynovel. I was intrigued and began to read GorkyPark and was blown away by the quality of the perfectly pitched writing andthe supremely intelligent story telling. I would thoroughly recommend him toanyone. ... FILMS/MOVIESThere areso many great crime films I could list, but as my current book is set in Tokyo,I will suggest Stray Dog by AkiraKurosawa. It is in black and white, shot soon after the Second World War andfeatures Kurosawa’s first collaboration with the great actor Toshiro Mifune. Itis a cold blooded, anxiety inducing depiction of crime in a pitiless city onthe verge of collapse. ... TV DRAMASPrime Suspect is hard to beat as a benchmark for all that isgreat about British crime drama, especially the first series. The cameradoesn’t ever stop moving as it follows DCI Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) as sheoutwits both the killer and the old-school, misogynists on her own team. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSAfter PatrickBateman in American Psycho, can anyfictional killer ever escape his shadow? He is the embodiment of sadistic terrorand unintentional hilarity in one perfectly groomed, narcissistic package. Withterrible taste in music. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’m sureeveryone gives the same answer – Philip Marlowe. I love the way he’s so jadedhe is barely motivated to solve the crime at hand, whilst also having all thebest lines. I always remember, “I needed a drink, I needed a lotof life insurance, …. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun. I put them on andwent out of the room.” ... MURDER WEAPONSThisinstantly made me think of Alabama Worley (Patricia Arquette) using a corkscrew as a weapon in True Romance. Ofcourse, she goes on to use a toilet lid bowl, a flaming aerosol can and a shotgun - all in the same scene. Typical Tarantino-esque restraint.     ... DEATH SCENESHow about Jean-PaulBelmondo’s “dégueulasse” speech as he breathes his last in A Bout De Souffle? Or the nihilist gangfinally doing for Donny outside the bowling alley in The Big Lebowski? The scene that always gives me nightmares is thedeath of Julian Wells in ImperialBedrooms. Another cold, amoral murder from Brett Easton Ellis.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESAm Iallowed to say YouTube? My novel is set in Tokyo, a city I last lived in abouteight years ago, so when I needed to be reminded of the look and feel of theplace I used the infinite amount of video on YouTube to help me. Of course, Ialso watched clips of cats making funny faces. ... WRITING TIPSNever getdisheartened. Keep going despite all practical evidence telling you to stop.And always keep reading. Every technical problem a new writer encounters hasbeen tackled before by an expert. Follow their lead. ... WRITING SNACKSA cup of hot sake, mixed into a bowl of chicken broth.

{"title": "Christmas: outside looking in", "date": "Sunday 10 December 2017", "text": "At this time of the year I sometimes feel like a trespasser. A ghostly apparition peering through a smudged window into a tinsel-draped world I'm not really part of. On the outside looking in. Here, but not here.I watch the fervent build up and read the frantic discussions on social media from the sidelines. Present buying. Christmas trees. Delicious festive treats. Large family meals... I don't join in, but that doesn't mean I don't understand your stress and excitement. I really do, as I have my fair share during the year.I've never celebrated Christmas. During my childhood, December 25th was simply a family day, with a large lunch, as there was little else to do. No Christmas tree. No presents. No Christmas pudding. We would still eat turkey though, along with home-made stuffing, brussels sprouts and minced pies. I remember Christmas crackers on the table and watching festive TV. After all, that's what everyone did at 'this time of the year'.I knew all about Christmas, don't get me wrong. I had plenty of friends who celebrated it - non-Jewish ones and Jewish ones - as I didn't go to a Jewish school. I didn't take part in the annual Nativity play but would watch the rehearsals from the sidelines, just as I watch the build up now, so I guess not much has changed. I didn't go to the school carol services either (we had a day off instead), yet I knew all of the carols anyway.For me, this time of the year has always been about Chanukah (Hanukkah), the Jewish festival of lights, which lasts for eight days. A festival of miracles and hope and joy. Unlike Christmas, Chanukah doesn't occur on a set date each year, as it's determined by the Hebrew calendar. One year, it may be in November, and the next year in December. This year it begins on 12th December - Tuesday evening -  as soon as dark falls.In keeping with tradition, each night we will light candles on a nine-branched Menorah (also called a Chanukiah), an extra candle each night (with the ninth candle called a Shamash (helper) to light the others). So one candle on the first night, two on the second and so on, until all eight candles are twinkling in a row. The candles symbolise a miracle in the second century BCE, when a handful of Jews defeated the Greeks to reclaim back their Holy Land and rededicated the Second Temple in Jerusalem. When they wanted to light the Temple's Menorah, there was only enough oil for one day - yet miraculously the oil lasted for eight days, known as the miracle of Chanukah.At Chanukah, it's traditional to eat fried foods - especially doughnuts and latkes (fried potato pancakes like rosti) - and to play a game with a dreidel (a four-sided spinning top) for coins, nuts or chocolate. We give money called Chanukah gelt (or chocolate coins) to children, as well as to charity. Chanukah is often associated with presents, but that's not a Jewish tradition so I assume it's the influence of Christmas. You can now even buy Chanukah decorations, as sparkly as the Christmas ones.As a child, I would receive one Chanukah present each night (some small, some large), as did my two boys when they were younger. Now they are teenagers, the eight-present tradition has faded away in our house. But not the candle lighting - never that.Here, Chanukah is also a time for community, with activities and celebrations at our Synagogue each year. This year we will have an interfaith event with the local church for the first time - our Rabbi will light a large Menorah as the vicar beside him switches on Christmas tree lights. There will be mulled wine and kosher minced pies and doughnuts.Some people worry they'll offend me if they wish me Happy Christmas. But not at all. When I say I'm on the outside looking in, I don't mean this in a negative way. I enjoy watching friends building up to their big event of the year - my Twitter and Facebook feeds are filled with that positivity. After the last year of world politics, we all need plenty of that.As I mentioned above, I do understand the exhilaration and delight, the stresses and strains. Every Friday, I prepare for the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat), which seems like the equivalent of a mini-Christmas break, just without the tree and the presents and the festive TV. Friday morning involves the obligatory 'challah rush' at the local kosher bakery, along with a mad dash to the kosher butcher and the deli. (Challah is the plaited slightly sweet 'Jewish' bread, if you don't know, and tastes a little like brioche.) Then on a Friday, I'm often cooking one, or sometimes two, three-course (or even four-course) meals by mid-afternoon - for just the four of us, or sometimes for up to 12 or more if we have guests.Then we also have all the other Jewish festivals, from our month-long 'festive' season in September/October to Passover (eight days) in March/April, which involves upheaval of the entire house - the original 'spring clean' (don't get me started on all the stress involved).People who know I'm writing fiction often ask me what I'm writing. I'm often suitably very vague. But the truth is that I'm writing Jewish-themed crime fiction, and plan to finish this WIP in 2018. I'm very open about my Jewish heritage and proud of it too. So assuming I finish this book, maybe one day you'll learn more about Jewish traditions and the huge sense of family and community spirit that I know so well.This should be a happy time of the year. A time for families, long-lasting friendships, peace and harmony. A time for families to get together and put aside their differences - hopefully a time for friends to resolve their differences too.I wish you all a Happy Christmas, Happy Chanukah or whatever you're celebrating. Thank you for reading to the end of this non-bookish blog post and for supporting my blog, which turns three on 30th December 2017."},

Andshe's not talking. Newly promoted, out of his depth, detective Huldar turns toFreyja and the Children's House for their expertise with traumatised youngpeople. Freyja, who distrusts the police in general and Huldar in particular,isn't best pleased. But she's determined to keep little Margret safe. It may prove tricky. The killer is leaving them strangeclues: warnings in text messages, sums scribbled on bits of paper, numbersbroadcast on the radio. He's telling a dark and secret story - but how can theycrack the code? And if they do, will they be next? My verdictI loved The Legacy, with its excellent writing, sharp plotting and compelling story, all taking place in an atmospheric Icelandic setting.I hadn't read any of Yrsa Sigurdardottir's books before this one, so wasn't sure what to expect. But this book hit me hard - in a good way. It was a great introduction to the author's books, as The Legacy is the first in a new series, called the Children's House.The Legacy focuses on child psychologist Freyja, policeman Huldar and a case involving a traumatised seven-year-old girl who may have just witnessed her mother's murder. It's a very dark read, with horrific death scenes that made me shudder - and it takes a lot to do that. Most of the descriptions weren't overly graphic (at least not for me), but the author's twisted imagination certainly left its mark.The plot was filled with twists, turns, red herrings and surprises right until the end.  It certainly kept me guessing all the way through. I'm looking forward to the next book in this series, which is being published next year."},

AUTHORSI’m a big fan of Peter Swanson, particularly his novel AKind Worth Killing. I also utterly love Gillian Flynn’s stories and how sheweaves crimes, sociopaths and psychopaths in and out of a story with suchapparent ease. I’ve had the pleasure of interviewing Tom Rob Smith, author ofThe Farm and the Child 44 trilogy, a couple of times before for magazines I’vefreelanced at. I’m such a fan of his work and found him inspirational.... FILMS/MOVIESMy all time favourite film is the Quentin Tarantino penned, TonyScott directed, True Romance. I don’t know which film I’ve seen more times,that, Casino or Stand By Me. Other firm favourites include The Mosquito Coast,Terminator 2, Heathers, My Own Private Idaho and Donnie Darko.... TV DRAMASWhere to begin? The Americans set the bar for this for muchof the last decade, but with dramas like Doctor Foster, Sherlock, PeakyBlinders and Line Of Duty, us Brits are fighting back. I’ll opt for someclassics like Lost, Mad Men, The Sopranos, and more modern classics that willstand the test of time, including Game Of Thrones, The Bridge and The WalkingDead.... FICTIONAL KILLERSIn his more recent books and adaptations, Hannibal Lecterbecame too much of a caricature, but in both Silence Of The Lambs and HannibalRising, Anthony Hopkins was mesmerising. Tony Soprano was also a charismatickiller and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho is one of the all timegreatest unreliable narrators, along with Gone Girl’s Amy Dunne. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Does Batman count? I’m not really a fan of superheroes butChristopher Nolan’s three Batman movies were just incredible to watch. And Iknow James Bond is technically a spy, but he has to rely on detective work toget his villains, surely? Miss Marple, Poirot and Sherlock aside, I’m going tochoose John Rebus from Ian Rankin’s novels.... MURDER WEAPONSMy weapon of choice to write about is a knife. A bullet isboring, strangulation is one-dimensional. But you can be so creative with aknife and a body. In real life, I’m actually a little scared of blades.    ... DEATH SCENES(Possible spoiler alert!)  A Kind Worth Killing.Bumping off one of the main characters half the way through a book was so brave.And almost all of the deaths in American Psycho paved the way for acceptablegore. ...

{"title": "Sleeping with Pain by Dr Sue Peacock", "date": "Monday 4 December 2017", "text": "Sleeping with Pain: Strategies for a restful night from a pain management expertBy Dr Sue PeacockPublished by Ann Jaloba Publishing (10 December 2016)I received a copy of the book from the authorPublisher's descriptionA practical guide to helpanyone who finds it difficult to sleep because of pain. Dr Sue Peacock takesyou through a step by step system for getting a good night's rest.My verdictI don't publicise very often that I have a chronic pain condition, although I did write a blog post about it earlier this year (click here) - one of my most popular blog posts. I don't sleep that well, and occasionally struggle to get to sleep due to pain, and often wake unrefreshed in the mornings. New research from Mintel revealed that one in five Brits complain that constant pain interferes with their sleep, so I'm clearly not alone.Sleeping with Pain was an ideal book for me to read. Dr Sue Peacock is a consultant health psychologist and head of The Health Psychology Service at Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. So she should certainly know her 'stuff'.The book is split into several chapters. 'How does pain affect sleep?' and 'Understanding your pain' provide background into the link between chronic pain and insomnia. 'Understanding the sleep cycle' explains the different states of sleep to help the reader understand their own sleep patterns. There is also a chapter on insomnia itself. This is then followed by practical ways to improve sleep, with case studies, questionnaires and goal setting. The book takes a very practical approach, with tips on re-progamming sleep patterns and self-hypnosis for pain.Has it helped? That's a difficult question to answer as my pain comes and goes - and so does my ability to sleep well. I've been reading the book for a few months and have tried some of the exercises and answered the questionnaires. I definitely now know how to get myself into a more relaxed state if I'm struggling to get to sleep. Some of the tips were quite obvious to me, but there were also some new ideas.If you suffer from chronic pain with insomnia, and want a simple practical approach, it may be worth giving this book a try. There are no guarantees of any results though, and always remember that if you're suffering with relentless chronic pain or insomnia you should see your doctor for advice.WRITING TOOLKIT gives you an idea of an author's writing process through the tools they use. The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome EMMA CURTISAUTHOR OF ONE LITTLE MISTAKETO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITWriting spaceI don’tattach much importance to where I write;it tends to depend on weather and who is living in the house. Currently bothkids are renting flats with partners (Hurray!) so that frees up theirbedrooms.  I also have a writing shed,which though perfect in Spring, Summer and Autumn, can be a cold in winter.  It’s also used for a – ‘where shall I put this, I don’t want to get rid of it but’, itemsand outside furniture.  So, it’s notalways conducive.  The essential thing isto feel uninhibited and because I write using Voice Recognition (more of thislater), it can be difficult to find that space if my husband is home.Creative writing booksI keep my favoritecreative writing books in thebathroom to dip into when nature calls, a habit that bemuses my husband.  I love Stephen King’s On Writing, Sandra Newman and Howard Mittelmark’s hilarious How not to Write a Novel, HarryBingham’s How to Write.  You think you know it all when you get yourfirst book deal, but you really don’t. You’re only scratching the surface.  It pays to be humble and learn lessons.DragonI use Dragon Voice Recognition to write myfirst draft because I have chronic pain in my hands, arms and shoulders.  It’s great for pounding through thosechapters, but unfortunately it slows down the editing process to such an extentthat I end up getting angry and pulling the plug.  It can also be tricky when you need to writea sex scene.  I wait for an empty housefor that task.  Not that I write many!  I am very much a ‘less is more, use yourimagination,’ author.SilenceI can’tbear being able to hear the radio, my husband on the phone, sneezing or merelybreathing near me.  I can handle noisethat I have no control over – like those pesky parakeets and squirrels whoenjoy a prolonged screeching session, but if I can put a stop to something, Ican’t ignore it.  This morning there arebuilders outside my window.  I’m doing mybest to blank them out.Healthy eatingFood is definitely part of the writer’s toolkit,and a tricky one to balance.  The weightcrept on.  I started 2017 with a hashtag#ThisWritersArse to motivate myself to lose it and get healthy again.  I have strict rules (I am an all or nothingperson). No eating between meals, no carbs. I have porridge for breakfast, a huge salad for lunch and for suppermeat and veg – no potatoes!  It’s worked.I’m now down to a respectable ten stone. Chocolate after lunch and supper, is my pat on the head for keeping myhand out of the biscuit tin. I keep a supply in the fridge and can becomedisproportionately upset if it vanishes.ClothesI think mymost important material item for writing is clothes.  I dread neighboursturning up unannounced (which they do all too often) because I look awful inbaggy old sweatpants and hideous jumpers. But I just cannot cope with anything that fits snuggly.A good night's sleepI don’t work in the evenings because I have trouble sleeping so avoid over-stimulatingmy brain.  A TV drama followed by acouple of chapters of whatever I’m reading, usually does the trick.  I don’t like box sets because they go on forso long.  I prefer English serials like Missing, Doctor Foster and Paulaand love Scandi Noir.THANKS FOR TAKING PART, EMMA!About Emma CurtisEmma Curtis was born inBrighton and brought up in London.

(JAMES) LAWto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSI’m amassive Val Mcdermid fanboy and have been for a very long time. When I startedwriting and I was trying all kinds of genres, it was seeing all of Val’s bookson my shelf one day that made me realise that maybe I should be writing in thegenre that I love to read. I love her description and the way she portraysreally dark happenings in really readable and accessible language – she’s justa really great writer. I think, if it hadn’t been Val, then I’d have had to gofor William Mcilvanney  - I discoveredhim much later than Val, but another really great writer and one who understood‘sense of place’ like few other authors I’ve ever read.... FILMS/MOVIESThis is atough one as I’m not a huge film/TV buff. I loved LA Takedown, which was laterremade as Heat. Just a really good, honest, cops against robbers movie that Icould watch again and again. But other movies that stand out would be TheDeparted and Manhunter – the latter was definitely the best in the Lectorcollections.... TV DRAMASThe Shield– hands down, no questions. It was awesome. Vic Mackey was the hero/anti-herothat you can’t help backing, but who crossed the line far too many times. Theway he was presented was awesome, the way he’d do the wrong thing for the rightreasons and take the Strike Team with him. This was TV at its very best.... FICTIONAL KILLERSFrancisDolarhyde – just a superb killer – came to life in Red Dragon, which is stillone of my favourite books. I think, whether writers admit it or not, a lot of today’sserial killers have their roots in Francis Dolarhyde.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Holmes!It’s a cliché for a reason, but I reckon that if you polled writers on thedetective they wish they’d created the most, I think Sherlock Holmes would beyour winner. Multifaceted and bizarre, there’s so much to do with thischaracter. He’s practically a super hero (or maybe he is?) but if I were toever write fan-fic, this is who it’d be about. The fact that the character hasbeen reprised so many times, successfully, but so differently, tells youeverything you need to know about it – well done Conan-Doyle!... MURDER WEAPONSI likemurders to be part of a human fury, so I think my favourite weapon would be thehuman body itself. Murder by strangulation with bare hands, or beating/kickingsomeone to death – flesh on flesh. We don’t need weapons really, humans areideally built for killing each other.    ... DEATH SCENESWhen Holmesfalls over the Reichenbach Falls – or maybe the final scenes of  Stephen King’s Carrie…  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThe firstthree books in my series really focus on misogyny, and if you want to researchthat, there really is only one place on the internet to go – Twitter.I follow aload of really smart women and I simply check the replies to their thoughts andopinions – that’s how I get inspiration for Hamilton, who spent 30 yearskilling women. I hope, one day, that Twitter will take some action and actuallystop the misogyny and other hatred that flourishes on its site, but until then,it’s my go-to place to research men being horrible wankers to women. ... WRITING TIPSIf you wantto write, then don’t spend time stopping, checking, changing and secondguessing yourself. If you have a good idea, then get it down and finish thebook. You can always go back and edit thoroughly later – you can changeanything you like, re-write sections, delete them and/or add new ones, but Ispeak to a lot of people who, for varying reasons, won’t finish their novel;for me, that first draft is just gathering together the clay you need toactually start making something. So my writing tip would be - write first –edit later – finish the fecking book!... WRITING SNACKSI’m tryingnot to at the moment, because I’ve ballooned in the past few years (120kg – thebiggest I’ve ever been!!!), but…… when I’m on deadline and things are gettingtense, my body is composed of approximately 87.43% peanut M&Ms and youmight occasionally find traces of blood in my Irn-Bru system….About J.S. (JAMES) LAWJames Law joined the Royal Navy in 1993 as an apprentice andwent on to serve for twenty years, the majority spent in the Submarine Service.He rose through the ranks, taking a commission as an engineering officer in2001, and serving as a Senior Engineer and Nuclear Reactor Plant Supervisor,where his responsibilities ranged from the safety and operation of thesubmarine’s nuclear power plant to hydraulic plants, fridges and toilets; itwas the latter of these tasks that brought the majority of any pressure.His final years in service were spent training futuresubmariners in the role of Senior Lecturer in Nuclear Reactor Engineering,where he lectured and mentored future submarine operators of all ranks andrates.Having written short storiesand novels throughout his naval career, James completed an MA in CreativeWriting at Portsmouth University shortly before leaving the navy in 2013,completing his debut novel, Tenacity, shortly afterwards.James lives in Hampshire withhis wife, Elaine, and two children.

{"title": "Author catch up - Gillian McAllister", "date": "Thursday 30 November 2017", "text": "I decided it was time to catch up with Gillian McAllister's first book - Everything but the Truth - rather than just read her latest one, Anything you do Say. So here's a double review.The books are two very different standalone psychological thrillers. Both are well written, intriguing and tense, with multilayered plots covering deep ethical and moral issues. In both cases, I found myself relating these back to me - 'What would I do?' and 'What would I say?'Everything but the Truth is a tale of domestic noir set in our social media-driven society. Rachel is pregnant. Although she loves and trusts her boyfriend Jack, she hasn't known him that long. When she finds a seemingly suspicious email, Rachel wonders whether she knows him at all. What follows is a twisty journey into discovering more about Jack's past - and, as Rachel's obsession escalates, there are also big reveals about her own. The two of them appear to have been selective with the truth - not just with one another, but also perhaps with themselves.In Anything you do Say, Joanne realises she's being followed after a night out at the pub. Convinced it's the man who was bothering her there, she lashes out in a panic - one of those split-second decisions that you come to regret. The man falls down some steps and lies motionless in front of her. And this is when the main story begins, as the narrative splits into two - the big 'what if'. What if Joanna runs (the 'conceal' scenario)? Or what if she stays and calls for help (the 'reveal' scenario)?I enjoyed reading these books, with both of them making me think and question.Everything but the Truth is a love story filled with secrets and lies - a look at honesty in a relationship and whether it's necessary to reveal everything or just hope your past doesn't catch up with you. Is it better to not know the truth about loved ones' pasts and just live in the 'here and now'? Funnily enough, I actually thought Rachel's own secret was 'worse' than Jack's.Of the two books, Anything you do Say had the slight edge for me, probably because I often think about the 'sliding doors' scenario. The 'what ifs' of life. Whether choosing a different path would have led to a different 'now'. Both storylines in Anything you do Say worked well, with enough overlap to make them both believable but without repetition of two potentially similar narratives. I found myself racing through this novel to discover Joanne's fate/destiny.I look forward to seeing what's next from Gillian McAllister.About the booksEverything But The TruthPublished by Penguin (March 2017)Publisher's descriptionIt all started with the email.Rachel didn't even mean to look. She loves Jack and she'spregnant with their child. She trusts him.But now she's seen it, she can't undo that moment. Or thechain of events it has set in motion.Why has Jack been lying about his past? Just what exactly ishe hiding? And doesn't Rachel have a right to know the truth at any cost? Anything You Do SayPublished by Penguin (October 2017)Publisher's descriptionIt's the end of the night. You're walking home on your own.Then you hear the sound every woman dreads. Footsteps.Behind you. Coming fast.You're sure it's him - the man from the bar who wouldn'tleave you alone.You make a snap decision. You turn. You push. Your pursuertumbles down the steps. He lies motionless, face-down on the floor.Now What? Call 999Wait for the police to arrive. For judgement, for justice, whatever that maybe. You just hope you husband, family and friends, everyone you love, willstand by you.OR:RunStay silent. You didn't mean to do it. You were scared, you panicked. And noone saw. No one will ever know. If you leave now. If you keep quiet. Forever.Which is it to be?Sweet Little LiesBy Caz FrearPublished by Zaffre (29 June 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisherPublisher's descriptionWHAT I THOUGHT I KNEWIn 1998, Maryanne Doyle disappeared and Dad knew something about it?Maryanne Doyle was never seen again.WHAT I ACTUALLY KNOWIn 1998, Dad lied about knowing Maryanne Doyle.Alice Lapaine has been found strangled nearDad's pub. Dad was in the local area for both MaryanneDoyle's disappearance and Alice Lapaine's murder - FACTConnection?Trust cuts both ways . . . what do you do when it's gone? My verdictSweet Little Lies was one of those books that made me think as I read. I had no idea who could be trusted or even if anyone could be trusted (whoever they were). I found myself questioning everything - trying to guess what was going on, with little success I should add.Caz Frear not only writes with confidence, but has also managed to plot a very twisty tale. Sweet Little Lies is more than just a police procedural as it focuses heavily on the main protagonist, police officer Cat Kinsella. Cat's family background is carefully woven into the story when she realises her father has links with the murder victim. So the book is part-psychological thriller too.Cat is very real with sharp cynical observations and believable flaws. I found myself getting right inside her head, listening to (and feeling) her daily struggle between loyalty to her family and loyalty to her job. Much of the story is set in places I know very well, which really brought the book to life for me - it's not often that I find Radlett, Hertfordshire, mentioned in a book.With just the right mix of humour, darkness and well-written narrative, Sweet Little Lies is an impressive crime novel filled with unreliable characters and plenty of intrigue.The ChoiceBy Samantha KingPublished by Piatkus (10 August 2017)Publisher's descriptionThen:Madeleine lived for her children. She'd always believedshe'd die for them too. But on the morning of her twins' tenth birthday herlove was put to the test when a killer knocked on their door and forced her tomake a devastating choice: whichchild should live, and which should die - her son, or her daughter?Now:Madeleine stands silent on the periphery of her fracturedfamily, trying desperately to unravel why her world was so suddenly blownapart. But as memories of everything leading up to that tragic day return inagonising flashes, she begins to realise her family's life still hangsterrifyingly in the balance...My verdictImagine you have two children. You can save only one of them and have to make a split-second decision. You choose. That's the premise of The Choice. Madeleine was forced to make that terrifying choice and it's been haunting her ever since, as she recovers from a family tragedy.Intrigued? I certainly was when I chose to pick up this book, especially as it had received such rave reviews, and I certainly wasn't disappointed by my choice in doing so by the end.The Choice is chilling, brilliantly twisty and filled with suspense. It explores memories and the fragility of the mind and is an emotional well-constructed psychological thriller  - one that's difficult to review without giving anything away about the plot.This rollercoaster read played with my mind as Madeleine tried to make sense of recent events through her own memories of the past. I was glued to the pages, unable to put this book down, reading most of it in one sitting.  So many layers being unravelled as I turned the pages.I can't say much more than that, other than buy it, read it and discover the 'wow' moments for yourself.Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome SOPHIE GOODFELLOWCommunications ManageratFMcM AssociatesWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first job was working at ED Public Relations. I workedthere for over four years before moving to FMcM Associates. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve been a publicity manager at FMcM for just coming up toa year now – it’s flown by! Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?So many! Where do I begin? I’ve been working on the latestAri Thor book by Ragnar Jonasson, which is reliably a treat. I’ve also beenworking on another amazing Icelandic crime novel called Snare by Lilja Sigurdardottir, an amazing thriller about a singlemother forced into cocaine smuggling in the aftermath of the financial crisis.On the non-crime front, I’m also working on the most beautiful andheartbreaking Australian book called TheRestorer by Michael Sala, a devastating and thoroughly convincing novelabout the deep roots of domestic violence. There’s so much more…  Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?Well an English degree never goes amiss – mainly cos you cansay you have one! I’m also fairly chatty and like people on the whole, which isa good quality for a publicist – you have to talk to a lot of them! I alsogenuinely love books. I have to read a lot of them, so that’s lucky. How do you relax after a busy working day?I’m lucky enough to usually come home and find dinner on thetable, or at least in the works! We watch television, it’s Bake Off at themoment (#justiceforLiam #freethehackneyone), and I try to leave enough time toget some reading done. What was the last book you read for pleasure?I actually genuinely had to check my GoodReads to remindmyself, it’s been such a busy autumn.

Oneof the toughest things I’ve ever done – and I learnt that Whovians are thescariest bunch of people to piss off! But seeing it all come together on theday was just amazing. Peter Capaldi and Steven Moffatt came along! If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?It’s a toss-up between astronaut or bookshop owner. I thinkeveryone who works in publishing secretly wants to run a bookshop, and everyonewants to go to the moon secretly surely.

AUTHORSRuthRendell writing as Barbara Vine. A Dark Adapted Eye is one of my favouritenovels. Rendell explores the darkest facets of human nature in disturbinglyfamiliar settings. She creates tension and menace seemingly effortlessly,pushing her characters to their emotional limits (and beyond) but with verylittle actual violence or gore. Her prose is spare and elegant, her plotting ingenious. ... FILMS/MOVIESThe SecretIn Their Eyes. This film has it all – a tortured writer haunted by the past, anunsolved murder, obsession, sexual tension – it’s dark and twisted and theending left me speechless. ... TV DRAMASHappyValley. Sarah Lancashire is phenomenal as Catherine Cawood – such strength andvulnerability. The Yorkshire setting is just the right mix of grim and grittyhousing estates and starkly beautiful countryside. As for the plot, I thoughtthe second series was even better than the first – so eagerly awaiting the nextinstallment! ... FICTIONAL KILLERSJean-BaptisteGrenouille in Patrick Suskind’s deeply disturbing but utterly compellingPerfume. I love the way the story is told through this strange young man’seyes, how his search for the most exquisite scents drives him to murder. Thisis one of the few books I have read several times and it is Grenouille whichdraws me back each time. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’m goingto go for a duo here – Saga Noren and Martin Rohde in The Bridge. I love therelationship between these two – Saga’s unpredictable nature and brilliantdetective skills plus Martin’s quiet dependability make for the perfect team. ... MURDER WEAPONSI have avery old, very heavy Le Creuset frying pan. Every time I take it out of thecupboard I joke to my husband that were I ever to murder someone, the fryingpan would be my weapon of choice. He doesn’t seem to find it very funny but itmakes me laugh.     ... DEATH SCENESIn Ozark, adark thriller set in the Ozark Lake region in Missouri, a young woman rigs alight at the end of a dock, connecting the cable to the dock ladder andelectrifying the surrounding water. A wonderfully tense scene ensues, as herintended victims approach the dock. I may have closed my eyes during the actualelectrocution – it was very grisly.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI quiteoften find myself on Webmd.com investigating exactly which injuries can befatal and how. NHS.co.uk has also proved helpful in this regard. As my booksare based in the Channel Islands, I spend a lot of time on the local governmentwebsites checking points of law or policy. ... WRITING TIPSRead.Anything and everything but particularly the sort of thing you want to write.If you like a book, think about why it worked for you and how you can emulatethat in your own work.

AUTHORSPatrick Hamilton (1904-1962), author of Hangover Square, TwentyThousand Streets Under the Sky, and other novels, and plays including Gaslightand Rope. Described by J.B. Priestly as ‘uniquely individual… the novelist ofinnocence, appallingly vulnerable, and of malevolence, coming out of somemysterious darkness of evil,’ Hamilton is the best of the British Noir writers.... FILMS/MOVIESRififi (1955), a French adaptation by Jules Dassin ofAuguste Le Breton’s novel of the same name. It contains the best heist sceneever filmed – half-an-hour of pure tension, without music or dialogue.... TV DRAMASI have commitment issues with TV series, so rarely watchanything all the way through, but I did enjoy Big Little Lies (even though theending was a bit disappointing). ... FICTIONAL KILLERSMary Katherine ‘Merricat’ Blackwood, from We Have AlwaysLived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson, with Tom Ripley and Sweeney Toddrunning her a close joint-second. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I’ve always had a soft spot for Qiu Xialong’s policeman,Chen Cao (Death of a Red Heroine, A Loyal Character Dancer, etc). He has tobalance the interests of the Communist Party with the demands of his job in acountry where every case is, potentially, a political hot potato. ... MURDER WEAPONSTruth is always stranger than fiction. In 2012, a Louisianajury convicted a 47-year-old homeless woman called Debra Hewitt of murderingher boyfriend. She removed her prosthetic leg and – balancing on the other(organic) one – used it to beat Dwayne Ball to death.     ... DEATH SCENESBill Sikes’s murder of Nancy inOliver Twist is utterly horrific: ‘Thehousebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty of immediatedetection if he fired, flashed across his mind, even in the midst of his fury,and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned facethat almost touched his own.’ Sikes finishes Nancy off with a ‘heavy club’,which he then burns, but he cannot get rid of the blood, which is everywhere(‘the very feet of the dog were bloody’). Dickens is thought to have based thisscene on a true crime: the murder of prostitute Eliza Grimwood.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThere isn’t one in particular, because I have to researchdifferent things for each book. For The Other Woman, I spent quite a lot oftime googling stuff about chest freezers… ...

AUTHORSMan, that’stough. There are a zillion crime authors I admire. But I’m going to plump for TanaFrench. She is a master-plotter, a stickler for detail and a creator ofcharacters who walk right off the page. I’ve read every single one of hernovels and what I love most is her writing smarts. For me, French proves that apolice procedural can also be a literary masterpiece. ... FILMS/MOVIESGoodfellas.I don’t think you can match Scorsese’s gangster movie for pace, energy and(very) dark humour. Joe Pesci’s ‘do I amuse you’ speech still gives me chills. ... TV DRAMASFargo.Fargo. Fargo. I love everything about it. The plots, the characters, the music,the cinematography. The first series starred Billy Bob Thornton as thecreepiest villain in TV history. Doesn’t make me want to visit Minnesota,though. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSRight,don’t laugh but I’m picking the killer(s) from the Wes Craven Scream movies.That mask – oh my god. I hate beingscared. Ironic, given that I’m a crime writer, I know. I remember wanting toflee the cinema but I couldn’t because my friends would take the piss. Ihaven’t toughened up since then. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES SherlockHolmes. My fixation with crime started with him. In fact, while myschool-friends were lusting after Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, I was allabout Arthur Conan Doyle’s creation. The aquiline nose! The pipe! The violinsolos! I was so obsessed that, aged 13, I forced friends to attend my SherlockHolmes-themed birthday party, complete with deerstalker cake (perhaps the realmystery is how I had any friends). ... MURDER WEAPONSMy favourite is Umberto Eco’s genius technique in The Name of the Rose. A monkpoisons the pages of Aristotle’s Poetics so that anyone who lickstheir fingers to turn the page is poisoned.     ... DEATH SCENESHannahTinti’s new book The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley is phenomenal. Halfwaythrough the story you see how the protagonist’s mum died and I’ve never grippeda book so hard in my life. ... WRITING TIPSStop making excuses. As Jodi Picoult says: ‘You can’t edit ablank page’. When you sit down to write, hammer out 350 words. Don’t thinkabout it, just do it. This technique forces you past the ‘horror of the whitepage’ stage. Yes, you’ll end up deleting ninety percent of it, but at leastyour fingers are warmed up and your brain is engaged. ... WRITING SNACKSIt’s a simple formula, really.Draft 1 = fruitDraft 2 = chocolateStructural edits = gin About CORRIE JACKSONCorrieJackson has been a journalist for fifteen years.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Adam Hamdy", "date": "Thursday 23 November 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome ADAM HAMDYto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSDeonMeyer.  I absolutely loved hispost-Apocalyptic epic, Fever, and have just started reading his crimefiction.  Late to the party, I know, butI’m glad to have learned of this cracking author.  I believein supporting new talent and know how hard it can be to get a signal boost whenyou’re starting out, so here are a couple of highly recommended forthcomingdebuts.  The Seven Deaths of EvelynHardcastle by Stuart Turton is unlike any other crime book you’ll have everread, a true rollercoaster for the mind. The Devil’s Dice, by Roz Watkins is a well-written modern detective talethat deals with a controversial contemporary theme.  ... FILMS/MOVIESPrisonersis a crime thriller that really sticks in the mind.  Written by Aaron Guzikowski and directed byDenis Villeneuve, it is about the abduction of two girls and the responses oftheir families and the police.  It is apowerful, often challenging film that kept me gripped until the finalframe.  Brilliantly written andexceptionally well put together with compelling performances from a cast thatincludes the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Viola Davis and MariaBello. ... TV DRAMASI loveAmazon’s adaptation of the great Michael Connelly’s Harry Bosch novels.  Titus Welliver is perfectly cast, theproduction values are great, and season three has to be one of the bestexamples of how to script a detective story. I can’t wait for the new series, which is due early next year.  My all-timefavourite crime show has to be The Wire. I loved the realism and complexity. Watching an episode felt like one hour spent cruising the mean streetsof Baltimore. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHow manypeople say Hannibal Lecter?  He’sprobably the only fictional killer I’d have to dinner, provided I was doing thecooking.I’ve got tosay John Doe, the serial killer played by Kevin Spacey in Seven.  He wasn’t just taking lives; he was trying toenlighten people.  I always findphilosopher killers far more sinister than those who simply perpetrate mayhem. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES William ofBaskerville, the protagonist in Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose.  He’s a man out of time, possessed of anintelligence and open-mindedness that would be more at home in the modernworld.  How much has been lost to theworld because of ignorance and superstition? Not just physical objects, such as the one at the heart of the book, butopportunity and advancement.  How farmight humanity have come if it hadn’t been constrained by repressive dogma?And beforewe get too heavy, and because detectives don’t always trade in doom and death,I’m going to share my guilty pleasure; The Big Lebowski.  Jeff ‘The Dude’ Lebowski is the mostchilled-out detective one could ever encounter, and a couple of hours in hiscompany puts a smile on most people’s faces. ... MURDER WEAPONSI have adoozy in my new book, but I’m not going to pimp my own twisted tools.  Probably a bowling alley.  David Mitchell’s novel, Number9Dream, has agruesome sequence in which one of the characters, a Yakuza gangster, takes hisenemies to a bowling alley and uses their heads as pins.  Twisting something as innocent and fun asbowling and turning it to murder is devious. The victims have that horrible five or six seconds of anticipation asthe heavy ball comes thundering down the lane…    ... DEATH SCENESSo manymemorable death scenes, but I’m going to go with Willem Storm’s death inFever.  The book opens with Nico Stormtelling us about his father’s murder, so I’m not giving any spoilers away.  Even though I’d known it was coming forhundreds of pages, Willem’s death was an emotional gut punch, a mark of trulygreat writing.  And it was all a…to sayany more would be a spoiler, so I’ll just leave it there.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESWhen Istarted out, I learned a lot from Wordplay (http://www.wordplayer.com/) a website created by Ted Elliot andTerry Rossio.  It’s aimed atscreenwriters, but there’s lots of useful information on character developmentand the essentials of good storytelling.Like a lotof writers, I’m a bit of a research junkie. I use hundreds of obscure blogs and websites to research weapons,national foods, clothes, locations, local dialect, countless things.  In addition to the less travelled paths,there’s lots of good information available from big beasts like the CIA andFBI.  Both publish thousands of documentson their websites.  If you’re an authoror filmmaker, the FBI has a special liaison office to assist with research intothe Bureau or its work.... WRITING TIPSA writer’slife tends towards solitude.  If I didn’tmake a concerted effort, I’d happily live as a hermit.  Beneath the bravado, I’m very shy, so much sothat I’m often queasy with nerves before social events.  But I learned long ago that living to thefullest and taking an interest in life is the best research.  Talking to people, learning about the detailof their lives, learning new skills, putting yourself in unusual, uncomfortableor challenging situations, all of these things can add depth and realism toone’s writing.  Highlights from my manyreckless episodes include picking up hitchhikers, becoming a temporary guardianto a pair of traveler children, impersonating a military official to travelthrough security checkpoints in the Middle East, and spending a lot of timewith a number of serious organized criminals and at least two murderers, all ofwhich was nerve-wracking, but led to some creative nuggets. ... WRITING SNACKSIf I get upto stretch my legs, I invariably find them leading me to the kitchen.  Luckily I’ve figured out that if the snackcupboard is bare, my weak will can’t betray me. Roasted and salted pistachios are my snack kryptonite, so I can’t havethem in the house.  The sedentary life ofa writer makes snacks the enemy, so my one daily indulgence is a cup of freshlyground black coffee with a shot of double cream.  About ADAM HAMDYAdam Hamdy is the author of the Pendulum trilogy, a series of conspiracy thriller novels.  James Patterson described Pendulum as ‘one of the best thrillersof the year’.  Adam is currently adaptingPendulum into an eight-part seriesfor Hardy, Son & Baker and NBC Universal.Prior to becoming a writer, Adam was a strategy consultantand advised global businesses in the medical systems, robotics, technology andfinancial services sectors.

The book was published by Orenda Books on 15 November 2017, Read my review...The CWA Anthology of Short Stories: Mystery TourPublished by Orenda Books (15 November 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionCrime spreads across theglobe in this new collection of short stories from the Crime Writer’sAssociation, as a conspiracy of prominent crime authors take you on a worldmystery tour. Highlights of the trip include a treacherous cruise to FrenchPolynesia, a horrifying trek in South Africa, a murderous train-ride acrossUkraine and a vengeful killing in Mumbai. But back home in the UK, life isn’tso easy either. Dead bodies turn up on the backstreets of Glasgow, crimewriters turn words into deeds at literary events, and Lady Luck seems to guidethe fate of a Twickenham hood. Showcasing the range, breadth and vitality ofthe contemporary crime-fiction genre, these twenty-eight chilling andunputdownable stories will take you on a trip you’ll never forget.Contributions from:Ann Cleeves, C.L. Taylor, Susi Holliday, MartinEdwards, Anna Mazzola, Carol Anne Davis, Cath Staincliffe, Chris Simms,Christine Poulson, Ed James, Gordon Brown, J.M. Hewitt, Judith Cutler, JuliaCrouch, Kate Ellis, Kate Rhodes, Martine Bailey, Michael Stanley, MaximJakubowski, Paul Charles, Paul Gitsham, Peter Lovesey, Ragnar Jónasson, SarahRayne, Shawn Reilly Simmons, Vaseem Khan, William Ryan and William BurtonMcCormick My verdictWhen diving into a short story collection, I am often reminded of a box of chocolates crammed full of sweet treats. Which one do I try first? Do I go with my usual favourites? Do I go for an author I've never read before? Do I read the stories in a logical order, working my way down the list? Or do I jump into the centre, picking and choosing as I fancy?Oh decisions, decisions...On picking up the CWA Anthology of Short Stories: Mystery Tour, I decided to follow the natural journey of the book, starting at the beginning and reading straight towards the finish line. After all, this is a 'mystery tour' so I figured I may as well head into the unknown.The book contains contributions by an impressive A to Z of some top crime authors, starting with Ann Cleeves' perfectly placed and brilliant The Queen of Mystery (set in the world of crime fiction conventions) and ending with William Ryan's dark and tense The Spoils (about a wronged woman). Although I had come across quite a few of the authors before, several were new to me - and I may never have discovered their talents if I hadn't picked up this book.The stories are very varied, in length, voice, setting and subject matter. I paused between them, reflecting on what I had just read, before embarking on the next stage in my journey - through the chilling and haunting Snowbird by Kate Rhodes to the cleverly plotted No Way Back by JM Hewitt and the very twisted A Slight Change of Plan by Susi Holliday. Ragnar Jonasson's A Postcard from Iceland is one of the shortest stories yet packs a powerful punch. And Christine Poulson's Accounting for Murder, consisting of a series of letters, receipts and other documents, is very clever and highly memorable. The locations are varied too - some set in the UK, others much further afield.The CWA Anthology of Short Stories is a great stocking filler or birthday present - although you can also just treat yourself. This is an excellent collection of high quality crime stories, ranging from psychological thrillers to crime scene investigations, providing something for everyone - and the chance to get out of your usual 'crime reads' comfort zone.Follow the Blog Tour:"},

{"title": "Whiteout by Ragnar Jónasson - Blog Tour", "date": "Monday 20 November 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Whiteout by Ragnar Jónasson. Whiteout was published by Orenda Books on 1 November 2017. Read my review...WhiteoutBy Ragnar JónassonPublished by Orenda Books (1 November 2017)I bought the ebook and pre-ordered the hardback, then received an ARC from the publisherPublisher's descriptionTwo days before Christmas, ayoung woman is found dead beneath the cliffs of the deserted village ofKálfshamarvík. Did she jump, or did something more sinister take place beneaththe lighthouse and the abandoned old house on the remote rocky outcrop? Withwinter closing in and the snow falling relentlessly, Ari Thór Arason discoversthat the victim's mother and young sister also lost their lives in this samespot, twenty-five years earlier. As the dark history and its secrets of thevillage are unveiled, and the death toll begins to rise, the Siglufjordurdetectives must race against the clock to find the killer, before anothertragedy takes place.  My verdictYet again, Ragnar Jónasson has written a compelling crime novel. I often compare his books to those of Agatha Christie (many of which he has translated into Icelandic). Whiteout, in particular, has a cosy crime feel to its plot, with a fairly small cast of suspects and a 'locked room (house, in this case)' scenario. Yet it's much darker than the Christie books - and obviously covers modern themes.The book is intriguing from the first page, introducing readers to a young woman called Ásta Káradóttir who has returned to her childhood home. This fleshes out Ásta's character straight away, so that when she's found dead at the base of some cliffs you already feel something for her. She's not just a random dead body - she's already someone the reader 'knows'. For me, this certainly made me want to discover what happened to her, and whether her death was just an accident. The fact that her mother and younger sister also died in the same spot, 25 years earlier, suggests something more sinister is going on. It's up to Ari Thór and his colleague Tómas to investigate.I read most of the book in one sitting. As expected, Whiteout is atmospheric and well written (and well translated), with haunting poetic descriptions of the old lighthouse and nearby abandoned house. Each of the suspects was present in the house that night. All appear to be harbouring secrets and may have a possible motive. I spent my time going round in circles trying to work out the 'whodunnit'. In the end I gave up trying, realising I just had to wait until Ragnar Jónasson revealed the truth at the end.Whiteout is full of secrets and surprises. It has left me wanting more - in a good way, I should add. I'm (almost) tempted to learn Icelandic, so that I don't have to wait too long to read the next book in this series. In the meantime, I'll have to head back to the beginning of this Dark Iceland series and read the books again.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Because there arefour doors left, and four murders will fill them...It's shaping up to be a deadly little Christmas. My verdictI'm a great fan of Susi (SJI) Holliday's writing, having enjoyed her Banktoun series - Black Wood, Willow Walk and The Damselfly. So I was very excited to read her new book, The Deaths of December. This is a police procedural with a Christmas theme. Someone has sent negatives of crime scenes in an advent calendar to the police. I loved the new characters - DC Becky Greene and DS Eddie Carmine - who have to figure out whether this is a prank or if there's a serial killer on the loose. I have no idea if this is the start of a new series, but I really hope it is, as I'd love to watch them develop.The Deaths of December is definitely Susi Holliday's best one yet. It reads very differently from her others, proving the flexibility of her writing skills. I feel like I've watched her grow as an author over the last couple of years. This chilling book has a great twisty plot, with a race against the clock, and is lots of fun (in a sinister murderous kinda way). It also has realistic dialogue and great descriptive writing. It kept me guessing and I couldn't put it down.I have to be honest - I don't 'do' Christmas, not in the way most other people do (please don't hate me for writing that). And I don't read Christmas-themed fiction. Or rather, the only Christmas-themed fiction I usually read involves crime, thrills and... erm... murder.So The Deaths of December was a perfectly wrapped festive read for me. And I'm sure it will be a perfect Christmas stocking filler for other crime fiction fans too. Buy it!!!!"},
{"title": "Deep Blue Trouble by Steph Broadribb", "date": "Wednesday 15 November 2017", "text": "Deep Blue TroubleBy Steph BroadribbPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 15 November 2017; Paperback - 5 January 2018)Publisher's descriptionHer daughter Dakota is safe,but her cancer is threatening a comeback, and Lori needs JT - Dakota's daddyand the man who taught Lori everything - alive and kicking. Problem is, he'sbehind bars, and heading for death row. Desperate to save him, Lori does adeal, taking on off-the-books job from shady FBI agent Alex Monroe. Bring backon-the-run felon, Gibson 'The Fish' Fletcher, and JT walks free. Teaming upwith local bounty hunter Dez McGregor threatens to put the whole job in danger.But this is one job she's got to get right, or she'll lose everything...My verdictWow! Steph Broadribb has done it again. Yes, kick-ass bounty hunter Lori Anderson is back in Deep Blue Trouble  - which is even better than the first book in this series, Deep Down Dead.I read this book early - really early - thanks to an error at Amazon UK, which delivered the e-book to my Kindle nearly three weeks before it was actually published. Well, I couldn't NOT read it straight away, could I?!I devoured Deep Blue Trouble in just a few hours (three short sittings overall), reluctantly having to put it down to go to sleep and then leave the house but diving straight back in as soon as I could do so.Lori is doing an off-the-books job for FBI agent Alex Monroe, searching for an escaped felon. But is Agent Monroe being as straight with her as he claims to be? Or is he putting her life in danger? When Lori teams up with a local bounty hunter, McGregor, there's tension from the outset. She is being threatened too, and has everything to lose if this job goes pear-shaped. So no pressure then...Yet again, Steph Broadribb has written a fast-paced action thriller.  Lori is fearless but also has plenty of heart, as well as determination and skills and maybe some luck too. This time, she leaves her nine-year-old daughter Dakota behind while she does her job, but that doesn't mean motherhood is out of her mind. In fact, everything Lori does is for Dakota's benefit, even trying to get JT (Dakota's father) out of jail and away from death row. She's constantly in fear that Dakota's cancer will come back, and will do anything to keep her daughter safe.In Deep Blue Trouble, Lori isn't working alone, as there are several others helping her behind the scenes. JT is back too, and this time he has a voice, so you can really get inside his head. I'm loving this series - it's fresh, fun and a rollercoaster read each time. There's a short story (The Last Resort) you can download too, which provides even more background to Lori and JT's relationship. I can't wait for the next book (though I know it will be a long wait) - I'm (not-so-)secretly hoping there will be even more of JT in there!WRITING TOOLKIT gives you an idea of an author's writing process through the tools they use. The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome SALLY EMERSONAUTHOR OF BROKEN BODIESTO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITNightI definitely have werewolf tendencies. I’m perfectly niceand normal during the day but as night settles in,I want to write. The darker it is the easier it is for me to write. I simplycannot understand how anyone can write in the day in their homes when there isall that LIGHT. I can’t concentrate when all the objects all around me arelolling around fully lit. How can anyone leave the ordinary world and enteranother one when there is daylight outside making everything look so ordinary?Don’t get me wrong, I like the day but find it completely uncreative. This isnot, incidentally, convenient as exciting life like parties and theatres anddinners happen at night (because night is fun and dangerous).MusicI am over my gangsta rap period (how I loved 50 Cent) but I dolike worrying music to be raging around me when I work. I can’t be doing withpeaceful classical music. Why? Because where is the excitement there? Atthis moment I am listening to the desperation in Placebo’s ‘Running Up ThatHill’. Music helps to create my mood for writing I suppose. Patti Smith’s‘Horses’ is still a favourite because it is on the edge. Her songs cry out,nothing is settled, and that quality of stifled panic makes me want to write tobe safe again.InkWhen I begin writing in the evening I usually start in longhand, with a fountain pen, in turquoise ink. It gives me a sense of the physicalpleasure of writing, the age-old relationship between the hand and the paperand the shape of the letters the writer makes on the page, the crossings out,all helped by the look of the ink. It’s a great way to get started, a treat.  Fountain PensI have a number of pens. Hmm. About twenty. But myfavourites of the moment are a gold Waterman pen with a great nib, and a newblue one. But I also love the little silver pen someone gave me which I cancarry in my bag. In the age of the i-phone, when people seem to avoid writinganything anywhere but on their phones I like the weight of the pen and thesheer beauty.  Once I start writingproperly I do move onto my desktop mac or my little silver mac because mywriting goes wild once inspiration strikes and I can hardly read what I write.NotebooksOpen my cupboards and notebooks of all shapes and sizestumble out, some with a couple of pages of notes, some with every page urgentlycovered with observations or records of conversation. Sylvia Plath wrote thatTed Hughes said he’d teach her how to concentrate and observe, and that’s whywriters have notebooks. In the right mood, with a lined notebook (not toosmall, not too big, just the right size) anything can be extraordinary. Thetrick of observing is to look and look until you no longer just see what otherssay you see – a green tree – but all the shades, the light, the shapes. Anotebook comes with me, wherever I am, in a park, in a street, in a shop, readyto help channel that concentration. And when it comes to descriptions, aremembered scene tends to be muted compared to an account sketched down at thetime.CafésIf I have to write in the day the only way I can function isto go out to a noisy café. Goodness knows why this works. I suppose thedaylight doesn’t worry me so much because it’s not shining on MY objects withall their connections. The jollity of other people creates a sense of isolationin me which is perhaps similar to that created by night. I wrote the screenplayof ‘Fire Child’ in an office off Carnaby Street, really fast.LondonIt inspires me, and always has. I can still remember firstcoming to live in Victoria as a teenager and finding it strange and disturbingin a good way – the sex shops, the river Thames, the way no one spoke to anyoneelse, all that mixed with the beauty of the squares with their mighty trees. Myfirst novel ‘Second Sight’ is set in Vincent Square, where I used to live.  ‘Fire Child’, a real London novel, full ofdarkness and energy, is set in Highbury in north London. My later novels including‘Separation’ which is set by the Thames, and about a new family, are morelight-filled. ‘Broken Bodies’ opens with my rival hero and heroine standing infront of the white glory of the Parthenon Marbles in the British Museum. It’s astory about love, but many kinds of love.Fear I like to be afraid when I write, afraid for my characters,afraid of what will happen next. It doesn’t do to be complacent in life so Ihope my stories take the reader on a big dipper ride. In ‘Listeners’ , justreissued, the heroine is at the end of her tether after her husband leaves heralone and she turns to a very dangerous woman for help. Reading back, the rawpanic of the heroine is disturbing (Like my protagonist, I’d broken up with myhusband but I had left him!)Black CoffeeObviously. It used to be cigarettes, in the good old days. THANKS FOR TAKING PART, SALLY!About Sally EmersonSally Emerson has lived in London most of her life. The first writing prize she won was for a poem about Highgate Cemetery. She climbed into the cemetery after it had snowed and it became her inspiration. Winning the prize gave her the confidence to know she could write (and that sometimes it’s good to be bad).  It’s just what her wicked, luminous heroine in ‘Fire Child’ would have done. She has edited magazines and won the Vogue Talent Contest and other awards. Her novels have been published in various languages to great literary and commercial acclaim. Included in the series of six Rediscovered Classics from Sally Emerson is the ‘twisted love story’  Fire Child and the ‘mysterious, compelling and strangely erotic’ tale of  Broken Bodies, where an intelligent love story becomes a thriller against the backdrop of the story Elgin’s extraordinary wife and the Elgin marbles. This is published alongside the chilling ‘Listeners’.Find Sally on her website, on her Facebook page and on Twitter - @sallyemerson8About Broken BodiesPublished by Quartet Books (26 October 2017)Publisher's descriptionPatrick Browning first sees Anne Fitzgerald in the British Museum infront of the Elgin Marbles – both young historians are fighting to uncover thesecrets of Mary Nisbet, the notorious wife of Lord Elgin. Anne thinks the present is frightening, but finds the past compelling;Patrick lives life at one remove, preferring the women in books to those inreal life. Before long, their research spills over into an all-too-realrivalry, a rivalry charged with tension and attraction – a rivalry which twiststheir own scarred love affairs to breaking point...

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with A J MacKenzie", "date": "Tuesday 14 November 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome A J MACKENZIE(Marilyn Livingstone and Morgen Witzel)to share their BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSML:  So many to choose from, but I've decided upon Lawrence Block, who was introduced to me by David Torrens of No Alibis Bookshop in Belfast.  Block writes a range of series from the comic to the very hard boiled, and most are imbued with the soul of New York. Reading his novels awakened a real interest both in harder edged crime fiction and in the city where they are set.MW: Almost impossible to choose with somuch talent out there, but Donna Leon hits the spot for me. The stories aresimple but subtle, the characters are great, and they’re set in Venice. Whatmore could you ask?... FILMS/MOVIESML: Rear Window. Not only is it a wonderful film with terrific performances by James Stewart and Grace Kelly and the ever-fabulous Thelma Ritter, but it is also an excellent mystery.  The audience is invited to join the film’s characters in their attempts to solve the puzzle of the Thorwalds and become co-voyeurs.MW: KeyLargo, with Humphrey Bogart and the great Edward G. Robinson. It’s about agang of criminals, rather than a murder mystery per se, but the writing is terrific. Nothing much happens, but italways feels like something is just about to happen.... TV DRAMASML:  I have happy memories of watching James Garner as Rockford with my mother as a child; more recently, I have really enjoyed Foyle's War; the final post-war series was particularly well done. MW: Sherlock.Great stories, great villains, great plots and inspired casting. Nuff said.... FICTIONAL KILLERSML: For meticulous planning (although notfor strong morale fibre) it is hard to beat Lawrence Block’s hit man, Kellerwho is the anti-hero of 4 collections of short stories and one novel.MW: this is a toughie, because killers inmost crime fiction are either rather weak or rather unpleasant or both. So I’mgoing for a rather obscure one:  IvanDragomiloff, played by Oliver Reed in the film The Assassination Bureau. Stylish and deadly, he even accepts acontract that names himself as the target to be killed. Okay, some people wouldsay The Assassination Bureau is athriller, not a crime story. But it does have ‘assassination’ in the title.Surely that’s not cheating?... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES ML: VI Warshawski. She is brave, with a complex character and interestingback story. The books are different in nature and there is a development ofVI's character over time.  They areintense reads, but with a leaven of humour.MW: Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmesis up there, but top of the list for me comes Marcus Didius Falco from LindsayDavis’s excellent series set in Rome in the time of Vespasian. He’s a man ofaction but also very human, cocky and self-deprecating, arrogant and fallible,constantly fighting with both his family and the Roman bureaucracy, and notalways winning. He has some great one-liners, too. ... MURDER WEAPONSML: The one that really intrigued me the first time I read it was in DorothyL SayersUnnaturalDeath was the use of an tiny air bubble as a murderweapon, which I learned later was not possible (at least not with smallbubble). A warning to all crime writers to check before using an ingeniousmethod to kill someone off!MW: I’ve just finished re-reading Robertvan Gulik’s The Chinese Maze Murdersand can’t stop thinking about a writing brush that, when heated, releases asmall compressed gas capsule, which in turn shoots a poisoned knife into thevictim’s throat. We’re going to have to steal that at some point, that issimply too good.    ... DEATH SCENESML: both of my favourites involve wine. The first is in Vintage Murder by Ngaio Marsh where the victim is killed by a jeroboam of champagne descending onto his head. The second is in an episode of Midsomer Murders where the victim is staked out on the ground and killed by bottles of wine being launched at him.MW: the killing of the Roman spy Anacritesby Falco and his friend Petronius at the end of Nemesis. I like the subtlety; the killing takes place in a darkalley, and is described using only a few sounds, no visual images at all. Andyet, if you have followed the series, there is such satisfaction in knowingAnacrites is dead. Why Falco didn’t rub him out a long time before is beyondme.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESML:  https://www.kent.ac.uk/english/ladys-magazine/index.htmlThe University of Kent’s The Lady’sMagazine (1770-1818): Understanding the Emergence of a Genre project hasbeen a great help in providing at guide to a superb resource for the lives andinterests of women in the late 18th century.  The free availability of the relevant yearsof the journal for our Hardcastle & Chaytor mysteries has also be very useful,but the Project’s index has saved a great deal of time (although browsingthrough the journal is always a temptation...)MW: www.timeanddate.com enables you to know the dayof the week and the phase of the moon at any time in the past. From the phasesof the moon you can also work out tide times. Our novels are set on the coastof Romney Marsh in the 1790s, and it’s great to be able to get these detailsright.... WRITING TIPSML: I like a bit of public writing, eitheron laptop or tablet or with pen and notebook. Years of working in noisy records offices (yes, really, the can be verynoisy places) has made me very comfortable working amongst the busyness ofothers.  Sometimes I spend a day with anantiques dealer friend as she buys in auctions rooms.  They always have good chairs and I get a lotdone!MW: Everyone writes differently. Find outwhat recipe – location, type of chair, music on or off, etc – works for you andthen stick to it. Don’t worry about what other people are doing or how theywrite; do what enables you to write and be happy.... WRITING SNACKSML: Tea, lots of tea.  On particularly cold days (we have a draughtyold house) hot chocolate is required. Also, the excellent cake made by Helen, a local friend and farmer’s wifewho makes the best coffee cake in the world.MW: Chocolate hobnobs are the fuel thatkeeps the AJ MacKenzie writing machine turning over.  Dark chocolate ones for preference, the milkchocolate ones are too sweet.About A J MACKENZIEA J MacKenzie is thepseudonym of Marilyn Livingstone and Morgen Witzel, an Anglo-Canadianhusband-and-wife team of writers and historians.

AUTHORSIf I had topick just one (which is a cruel and unusual punishment) Lee Child. An amazingcentral character in Jack Reacher. Great plotting that pulls you through thepages. Great writing. Clean. Pacy. Stripped-down in its elegance. The qualityof Lee Child’s writing can get overlooked because of the phenomenon that isJack Reacher, but he can write a fight, a moment, or a place that makes you feel like you’ve been thereyourself. ... FILMS/MOVIESShadow of a Doubt. I love black and white movies but for the sheerquality of the script (by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson and Alma Reville), ithas to be this story of small town America. Young Charlie Newton (played by Teresa Wright) lives in Santa Rosa,California. She’s bored, but her life is about to be turned upside down whenUncle Charlie (yes, she is called after her mother’s suave handsome brother - playedby Joseph Cotten) arrives in town. Uncle Charlie is no ordinary uncle, in facthe is in the frame for being a serial killer dubbed the “Merry Widow Murderer”.Uncle Charlie it turns out, thinks elderly widows are “fat, wheezing animals”and poses the blood-chilling question: “What happens to animals when they gettoo fat and too old?”. Nightmare Uncle-in-the-house territory and an utterlybrilliant movie. ... TV DRAMASThe Wire. Does everyone say The Wire? Ambitious. Epic.Engaging. Intelligent. Heart-breaking. You committed to it and you went with itwhere-so-ever it chose to take you.  Myfavourite season was probably the first – the illegal drugs trade, but franklywatching it from start to finish should be required viewing to understandmodern society. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSDexter. I came quite late to Dexter, so binge watchedit. I then had to ration myself, because it was giving me such vivid,blood-splattered nightmares that they had my nearest and dearest convinced I harbouredmurderous tendencies. How can a serial killer engage the viewer in the wayDexter did? Because despite the serial killing habit, he was trying to be agood guy? Trying to understand himself and others, in a world that only madesense to him if he was allowed to wrap a lot of bad guys in clingfilm, stabthem, and drop their bodies in the bottomless ocean? ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Marcus Didius Falco from Lindsey Davis’ fantastic Romandetective novels set in the ancient world. You get to find out that preservedfish made for good sauce, that books came in scrolls, and the expectations on aRoman matron who has no intention of behaving like she ought to, plus you getto travel with Falco through the hot, cobbled, stinking streets and into thevillas of the wealthy and wicked to solve grisly and unexpected murders. What’snot to love? The next best thing to time travel. ... MURDER WEAPONSAn icicle features in The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.It’s not a murder, but it’s how a murderer dies. Although I’m torn between that,and The Name of the Rose when UmbertoEco had someone poison the pages of a book so that anyone licking their fingersto turn the pages promptly died. Mad monks don’t you love them?     ... DEATH SCENESRed Dragon by Thomas Harris. The idea of the broken mirrorshards being placed on the eyes of the slaughtered victims is awful.Particularly when the victims were picked out because psycho Francis Dolarhyde feltdrawn to the mothers when he processed the family’s films.   ...

Listen and learn. ... WRITING TIPS*readeverything. If you don’t read, you won’t get better. I attended an eventrecently with bestselling writer Martina Cole (who is utterly lovely by theway) and there are times she reads a book a day. Martina Cole has an amazingwork ethic. If she can find time to read, you can.*sit downand make yourself write, even if you don’t feel like it. However good youridea, if you don’t get the words on paper, it ain’t happening.*read booksabout the craft. They help.*if you arestuck with something, write yourself a letter in the form of a conversation andkeep it going. It’s amazing what comes out when you ask yourself questions.I’ll recommend a book that I found particularly useful: “Writing from theInside Out” by Dennis Palumbo. Recommended to me by David Morrell (the fatherof Rambo.) *tell yourfriends and family you take your writing seriously and ask them to respectthat. *don’t riseto the bait when someone informs you they have a really great idea for a bookand they’d write it but the fact they simply don’t have the time.*this isyour book and your career. No one can do it for you. Own it. *get theword “Relentless” tattooed somewhere ...

{"title": "Author catch up - Helen Fields", "date": "Friday 10 November 2017", "text": "Helen Fields' first book - Perfect Remains - had been sitting on my shelf for several months when Perfect Prey arrived. They were actually only published six months apart, but it felt like a lot longer, as I had seen people raving about them on social media. Since this is the beginning of a series, it made sense to review them together.Soon after reading Perfect Remains, I suspected that this serial killer series would become one of my favourites. After reading Perfect Prey, I can definitely say it's now in my top crime series list. Both books feature DI Luc Callanach and DI Ava Turner and are set in Edinburgh.In Perfect Remains, DI Luc Callanach arrives in Scotland and is drawn straight into a murder investigation. Women are being taken and murdered by a serial killer, with very little of their remains being left behind. Can Callanach and Turner prevent another death? Time is running out....In Perfect Prey, Callanach and Turner are back, investigating a series of gruesome murders. Each victim seems to be a pillar of the community. Their name is featured on graffiti around the city - graffiti that appears BEFORE the crime takes place. What's going on?I can't praise these books highly enough. I read them in two sittings each, totally engrossed in the chilling plots, kept on the edge of my seat, barely taking a breath.In both books, the killings are very dark and very twisted with a hint of horror. The writing is stunning and compelling, with vivid descriptions of people and places. It's also emotional - the detectives are very real, flawed but realistically so. Callanach is French/Scottish origin, which provides an intriguing backstory.This would be a perfect series for the big (or little) screen. There are SO many twists and turns and 'gasp out loud' moments - these intelligent crime thrillers are a brilliant rollercoaster read.  No cliches here - these plots are totally unique. If you're a fan of Fiona Cummins' Rattle (one of my favourite serial killer books), you're likely to enjoy Helen Fields' books too (and vice versa). I'm looking forward to seeing how Callanach continues to develop as a character, and also his relationship with Turner as the series goes on. So I can't wait to read Helen Field's next book, Perfect Death, which is out in January 2018.About the booksPerfect RemainsPublished by Avon (26 January 2017)Publisher's descriptionOn a remote Highland mountain, the body ofElaine Buxton is burning. All that will be left to identify the respectedlawyer are her teeth and a fragment of clothing.In the concealed back room of a house inEdinburgh, the real Elaine Buxton screams into the darkness…Detective Inspector Luc Callanach has barely set foot in hisnew office when Elaine’s missing persons case is escalated to a murderinvestigation. Having left behind a promising career at Interpol, he’s eager toprove himself to his new team. But Edinburgh, he discovers, is a long way fromLyon, and Elaine’s killer has covered his tracks with meticulous care.It’s not long before another successful woman is abductedfrom her doorstep, and Callanach finds himself in a race against the clock. Orso he believes … The real fate of the women will prove more twisted than hecould have ever imagined.Perfect PreyPublished by Avon (27 July 2017)Publisher's descriptionWelcome to Edinburgh. Murder capital ofEurope.In the middle of a rock festival, a charity worker is slicedacross the stomach. He dies minutes later. In a crowd of thousands, no one sawhis attacker.The following week, the body of a primary school teacher isfound in a dumpster in an Edinburgh alley, strangled with her own woollenscarf.D.I. Ava Turner and D.I. Luc Callanach have no leads and nomotive – until around the city, graffitied on buildings, words appear describingeach victim.It’s only when they realise the words are being writtenbefore rather than after the murders, that they understand the killer isannouncing his next victim…and the more innocent the better."},
{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Matthew Smith", "date": "Thursday 9 November 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest MY PUBLISHING LIFE feature, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome MATTHEW SMITHPublisher DirectoratUrbane PublicationsWhat and when was your first job in publishing?I actually started as a Waterstones bookseller in 1991, butmy first ‘proper’ publishing role was as an editorial assistant at Routledge in1993. Based in the glamour of New Fetter Lane (the building is gone now andreplaced with a ‘shiny’ vision of the future) I supported two editors in theheady and glamorous world of academic publishing – I even had preferential useof the floor’s only fax machine. Happy days. I genuinely learnt a great dealabout the publishing world in that first role, as well as earning big bucks (a whopping£9250 a year no less!). How long have you been working in your current job/role?I walked away from a director role at a publishing house andset up Urbane in early 2014. I don’t think I’ve had a complete day off since!It’s been a constant positive challenge, and despite 25 years of publishing I’mlearning every single day. There are occasionally huge frustrations (don’t getme started) but they are always outweighed by the simple wonder of publishingnew books. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I’m just about to publish a brilliant crime debut – DeadLands – a thrilling 70s set police procedural. Lloyd is definitely a writer towatch and I’m over the moon to bring his work to the world. I’m also veryexcited about Javelin by Roger Pearce. Roger was an established thriller writerwith Hodder but decided to publish his third book with Urbane – it’s a hugeboost for everyone involved with the company that an author has shifted fromone of the big five to publish with an independent. We’re actually in theprocess of presenting our Spring 2018 titles as well – keep your eyes peeledfor HellCorp by Jonathan Whitelaw, Trouble Boys by E.R.Fallon and The Kindnessof Strangers, Julie Newman’s second novel after this year’s gripping debut,Beware the Cuckoo. Excited? You bet I am! Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?On a practical level many publishing jobs still demand adegree, so that helped get a foot in the door, but it’s a total nonsense.Because much of publishing is about people, whether you’re dealing with authorsor trying to predict reader interests. I spend most of every day either talkingto people or responding to messages. I once compiled a list of skills for atypical commissioning editor, and they ranged from social worker andpsychiatrist to accountant and operations manager. Whatever role you have inpublishing it will always be varied and change day-to-day – it’s never dull!And three things you must have in huge doses are commitment, persistence andpatience (particularly when dealing with authors. Only joking. Honest!).  It also helps if you can read! 😉 How do you relax after a busy working day?I find it very hard to switch off from the business as thereis ALWAYS something else that needs doing, but I do try and read as much aspossible (and not just scripts that get sent to me – see next question), andspend as much time with my children as I can (much to their annoyance!) 😊 I also have a motorbike and that is agreat stress-buster. Though only at legal speeds officer. What was the last book you read for pleasure?I try to read two to three books a week that are not directly relatedto Urbane and I have very eclectic tastes. I buy from bookshops, but alsosupport the local library as much as possible. Current books on the readingpile are May Day (a novella by F.Scott Fitzgerald), He by John Connolly, andStephen King’s latest blockbuster Sleeping Beauties. Describe your job in 15 words or less...Believer in dreams. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farFar too many to list! Seeing two authors make the WHSmithFresh Talent list was very special (Adrian Harvey and Tom Hocknell), and I’malways delighted when an author gets positive coverage of any kind. But thegenuine highlight comes with every new book and the sheer thrill and excitementthat inspires not just in me but the author and readers. I f I ever lose thatfeeling it’s time to give up. Though there was that night I went drinking with StevenBerkoff…. If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I’ve given up the dream of starring in Baywatch so I’d haveto go with motorcycle mechanic. I have no skill in that area whatsoever butwould love to learn - and there’s something very appealing about fixing upbroken bikes and making them work again. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Extraordinary tales from an ordinary lifeThanks so much for taking part, Matthew!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "A Legacy of Spies by John Le Carré", "date": "Wednesday 8 November 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for A Legacy of Spies by John Le Carré. A Legacy of Spies was published by Viking on 7 September 2017. Read my review...A Legacy of SpiesBy John Le CarréPublished by Viking (7 September 2017)Publisher's descriptionPeter Guillam, staunch colleague and disciple of GeorgeSmiley of the British Secret Service, otherwise known as the Circus, hasretired to his family farmstead on the south coast of Brittany when a letterfrom his old Service summons him to London. The reason? His Cold War past hascome back to claim him. Intelligence operations that were once the toast ofsecret London are to be scrutinised by a generation with no memory of the ColdWar. Somebody must be made to pay for innocent blood once spilt in the name ofthe greater good.Interweaving past with present so that each may tell its ownstory, John le Carré has given us a novel of superb and enduring quality.My verdictThere's no doubt that John Le Carré is the master of spy thrillers. Like many people, I grew up reading his books, loving the tension and intrigue of his multi-layered plots and his ability to tell an intelligent spellbinding story.In A Legacy of Spies, I loved the mix of 'old and new' and 'past and present' and changing values and attitudes (politically and socially) over the years. It was entertaining reading how the younger characters viewed the older ones, and vice versa. The book definitely felt 'old school', with an air of nostalgia. It's as if John Le Carré was pitting his old characters against these new ones to see how they all get on - and who would have the upper hand.The dialogue is brilliantly written, with sharp observations and descriptions of characters that made me smile. I couldn't help but admire the author's writing, plotting and characterisation. This is a 'must read' for John Le Carré fans.I have to admit that it's been years since I read one of his books, so I 'almost' read A Legacy of Spies as a standalone. It would probably have made sense if I had recapped on The Spy Who Came in from the Cold first, as there are many references to this and previous major characters. I did struggle in a few places to understand what was going on. But some memories of past books did come flooding back, and this has now prompted me to pull the older books off the shelf.Follow the Blog Tour"},

AUTHORSArthur Conan Doyle. I absolutely love our crop of modern crimewriters but I find reading Sherlock Holmes stories so comforting as well asconstantly surprising. My husband bought me a huge compendium of Arthur ConanDoyle’s collected works and it’s as big as a bus. I’m working through it veryslowly and savouring the hell out of it.... FILMS/MOVIESRear Window. Anyone who has read my second novel willunderstand just how much of an influence this was. My middle son and I areobsessed with Alfred Hitchcock. We love the films but also his ingenious TVseries Alfred Hitchcock Presents… which ran for about a million years andfeatured a short twisty TV play each episode. ... TV DRAMASThe Killing. There have been many other Scandi crime seriesthat I’ve loved, but this was the very first I experienced and it blew me away.I think this was the first time in our ten-year marriage that my husband and Iwatched a murder mystery together. It felt like an icy blast of refreshing airand, looking back, I can now see what an effect Sarah Lund had on mycharacters.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSSilvio Dante from The Sopranos. If you’ve watched this iconic series(and if you haven’t, I implore you to!) you’ll know which killing in particularmade me say this. Silvio was one of my favourite characters anyway, so dry andblunt but always human. I wept watching this scene. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Hercules Poirot. I’m a sucker for a brilliant jerk, and Poirotis the best of the best. Even though he can be a total arse, you forgive himhis pomposity because he’s always three steps ahead and because he’s such asnappy dresser. ... MURDER WEAPONSSpike of ice. I’m a big fan of weapons that don’t leave atrace and love this classic idea of a weapon that simply melts away.     ... DEATH SCENES*spoiler alert*Han Solo. A collective gasp rang through the cinema whenI watched The Force Awakens, followed by sobbing (mostly mine). Although I lostinterest in Game of Thrones after series one, I also loved how it killed offbig characters early doors. It’s brave and thrilling when that happens.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThe British Newspaper Archive. I recently treated myself to anannual subscription and it’s an absolute treasure trove! All human life is there,in its ugliness and its joy. It’s incredibly useful for historical research, awonderful way to see the concerns of the time as well as learn patterns ofpopular words, terms and names. And of course it’s a rich vein of inspirationfor plots. ... WRITING TIPSTake a break. If you’re getting bogged down in detail, ifyou’re trying to write yourself out of a plot hole, if you don’t quite believein your characters, if you’re writing words just to hit a daily target andyou’re not really feeling any of them… take a break. Put it down, go for awalk, take a few days off without thinking about the book. If you’re minted,book a last minute holiday! I used to fall into the trap of over-writing andlosing all perspective. Now I’m precious about time away from my manuscriptsand (in terms of re-writing guff) it’s more efficient that way.   ... WRITING SNACKSKaas blockjes (cheese blocks). I live in the Netherlands, which ischeese mad and every supermarket plus plenty of corner grocery shops sell tubsof cheese blocks. Dutch is a wonderfully literal language and you can generallychoose between ‘jong kaas blockjes’ (literally young cheese blocks – mild and deliciously rubbery) or ‘oud kaasblockjes’ (you guessed it, old cheeseblocks – mature, crumbly and tangy).

{"title": "They All Fall Down by Tammy Cohen", "date": "Monday 6 November 2017", "text": "They All Fall DownBy Tammy CohenPublished by Transworld (13 July 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionHannah had a normal life – aloving husband, a good job. Until she did something shocking. Now she’s in a psychiatricclinic. It should be a safe place. But patients keep dying.The doctors say it’s suicide.Hannah knows they’re lying.  Can she make anyone believeher before the killer strikes again?My verdictTammy Cohen has done it again with this twisty psychological thriller. They All Fall Down is a brilliant read and I highly recommend it.Set in a private psychiatric clinic, the book has the perfect claustrophobic setting and a whole host of unreliable fragile characters who all have something to hide. It's clear that you probably can't trust the patients, who suffer from a range of mental health problems and emotional traumas, but can you trust anyone else in the book either?The story is told from several points of view - all potentially unreliable and very convincing. It's an emotional read and highly thought-provoking, looking into the often-taboo topic of severe depression and hospitalisation. A brave decision to use this setting, I thought when I first saw the blurb, as there's the potential to get it wrong. Yet Tammy Cohen has handled her characters' mental health issues with sensitivity and compassion, carefully weaving them into her plot and raising awareness of some difficult psychiatric issues. She has an amazing ability of getting right inside her characters' heads.The book is cleverly plotted, unpredictable and different from the current psychological thriller trend. So many layers to peel back, and so many twists, turns and surprises that kept me guessing - and they kept on coming right until the very end. I ignored the rest of the world while I read the book, unable to put it down. This wasn't always an easy read in terms of subject matter, but the gentle dark humour helped to break up the tension.Tammy Cohen's books get better and better. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next."},

It’sfantastic to leave behind the world of DNA, CCTV, smartphones and technology toread about people and Christie’s wonderful perspective on what motivates peopleto murder each other. ... FILMS/MOVIESMurder on the Orient Express. Probably a little predictable thatI love this film. I’m eagerly awaiting this year’s release and one of the fewfilms I would make a point of seeing at the cinema. ... TV DRAMASLife on Mars and Ashesto Ashes were genius TV dramas. I must admit, it took me some time to catchon as I very rarely watch crime dramas, but I’m so glad I did. I lovedeverything about them.... FICTIONAL KILLERSSorry, Idon’t have one. It’s probably the job I do but I’ll never have a favouritemurderer, even a fictional one. It goes against the grain. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Briggs and Louis from TheDetectives. Jasper Carrott and Robert Powell portrayed the most realisticdetectives I’ve ever seen on television, and managed to make me laugh at prettymuch anything they said and did. I think part of the reason I like them so muchis because they were normal, and very daft. ... MURDER WEAPONSAn icicle would make a genius murder weapon.

I rip each post-it into three raggedy piecesand use them to mark paragraphs I want to remember in my research books. Thebest books end up with hundreds, like a bizarre kind of plumage. It saveswriting on the pages, which I hate, but it’s a real pain taking them off if Idecide to donate books to a charity shop. 'Work hard' signThis hangs behind my desk as a reminder. I used to have ahand-scrawled sign until a lovely friend painted this on wood for me. My dadwas a workaholic and I think he’s passed on a bit of a gene because I’m notgood at taking days off.

{"title": "Tin Man by Sarah Winman", "date": "Tuesday 31 October 2017", "text": "Tin ManBy Sarah WinmanPublished by Tinder Press (27 July 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionIt begins with a painting won in a raffle: fifteensunflowers, hung on the wall by a woman who believes that men and boys arecapable of beautiful things.And then there are two boys, Ellis and Michael,who are inseparable.And the boys become men,and then Annie walks into their lives,and it changes nothing and everything.My verdictTin Man is only a short book but it packs a powerful punch and is filled with emotion. It's packaged beautifully, inside and out.This book was clearly written to be read slowly and savoured at every sentence - with its stunning poetic writing and the compelling haunting tale. It's a book about love, loss, loneliness, desire, friendships, sexuality and relationships. There are no speech marks, which means all of the writing flows into one, taking you on a journey through the characters' lives.It's a melancholy book, though it made me smile in places, and certainly made me think - about what's important in life and how to hold on to those friendships that mean the most. I cared about each of the characters, and they seemed very real. I felt as if I knew them by the end - their hopes and dreams, likes and dislikes.I don't think Tin Man will appeal to everyone, but I think many people will be reaching for the tissues. I think it helps if you know what to expect before you dive inside. This isn't a book of action or fast-paced plotting. This is very much a book about thoughts and emotions, how different people belong together and how the right or wrong choices can influence our future. A highly moving book about that 'what might have been' feeling that touches so many people."},

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome JONATHAN RUPPINFounder (& Literary Agent)ofThe Ruppin AgencyWhat and when was your first job in publishing?A Christmas temp at Dillons – a chain swallowed by Waterstonesat the end of the 90s, for those too young to remember it. I got called up forjury service the week I was supposed to start, but the manager was patientenough to let me start a few days late, and I loved it. I was running theFiction section by New Year. Booksellers are wonderful people. It’s the only job – apartfrom perhaps librarian or primary school teacher – where people can ask you aquestion about literally anything and expect you to know what they’re talkingabout.How long have you been working in your current job/role?The agencylaunched at the beginning of September although it was in the works for a longtime before. I am sure your inbox is overflowing with submissions. What is most likely to grab your attention at present?The submissions that have stood out for me so far have hadscope, ambition, boldness of imagination. I want something that resonates, thatlives beyond the page. I don’t just want novels with plot and character ornon-fiction that’s well-informed – I want a perspective on life, on the worldaround us.I’d really like to find fiction that has something to sayabout the state of society today. British fiction can be very stuck in the past,and at a time when Brexit has shown many of us that we live alongside peoplewhose lives we know little about, there’s an opportunity to take advantage ofthe fact that people do explore the world vicariously through fiction.Non-fiction projects that put their topic in the context of the humanexperience would be very welcome too.I’m building contacts to try to find more writing fromunderrepresented voices – working-class, BAME, LGBT, writers with disabilities,writers from beyond the book world’s south-east bubble – many of whom can offernew perspectives, although I certainly wouldn’t turn down a talented writer whohappened to come from a background similar to my own. Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I’ve done a lot of different things in the book world. Myretail experience covers the shopfloor, head office and online for indies and chains.I’ve bought for just about every adult trade category and I’ve done events andmarketing and social media. I’ve worked for agents and a publisher and adigital publishing start-up. I’ve interviewed authors on the stage and thepage, stood on committees for a whole range of literary organisations, writtenand edited, judged awards, consulted hither and yon, popped up all over thetrade and national press. But most of all, I’ve spent over two decades reading newtitles constantly and watching the way every category of trade publishing hadebbed and flowed, flourished, folded and reinvented itself anew. That and theinspiration of working with and learning from so many other passionatebook-lovers who’ve managed to turn their passion into a career, especially mypartner, Emma. How do you relax after a busy working day?Music. I don’t stream – I still believe in albums and I seemto buy as many as ever. My taste is pretty catholic, but the 70s is the decadeI couldn’t do without; David Bowie is my guiding star.What was the last book you read for pleasure?Croatian War Nocturnalby Spomenka Štimec,translated by Sebastian Schulman. Its Croatian author is a major figure in Esperantoliterature and the novella consists of poignant fictional sketches of thedevastation and trauma caused by the Balkan Wars. I’m also making my way through Know Your Place, a crowdfunded anthologyof essays on British working-class life and identity by working-class writers,including Kit de Waal, Catherine O’Flynn and Andrew McMillan. Describe your job in 15 words or less...Reading,networking, research, editing, email, communication, negotiation, pedantry, teaand more reading. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farThe bestpart of my job at Foyles was looking after all the authors who came into signtheir books, so I met thousands of them. I’ve also had the chance to interviewa few of my favourites on stage: talking with David Mitchell about TheThousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet was about as much fun as I’ve ever had atwork. Being a literary prize judge has also always been fun: it’s a chance toread dozens of new books and recommend the best to loads of people at once. If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?Thisquestion seems to have brought out my inner five-year-old: a train driver.Looking out of the front window while the train races past goods yards, throughvalleys and over bridges would be a thrill. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Have YouRead This? I’m always interested in what people are reading and which booksthey especially love, and it always gets me wondering what I can recommend.Once a bookseller, always a bookseller.

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome PHOEBE MORGANCommissioning EditoratHarperCollinsWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first job in publishing was as a Publishing Assistant atOctopus Books, specialising in non-fiction. I was working across children’s andadult, and my job involved editorial and administrative duties as well as somespecial sales tasks. Octopus is a really lovely company and I remember being soexcited on the day I got the job, as I’d had quite a few interviews by thatstage and kept losing out! Getting into publishing can be hard but once youhave a foot in the door it’s such a rewarding, welcoming industry. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve been working at HarperCollins for coming up to a yearand a half, and I’ve been a Commissioning Editor for the past few months. Priorto that I was an Editor, and I now work across a range of crime, thriller, sagaand women’s fiction, buying books from agents and taking them through theeditorial process to publication. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I’m very lucky to have a wonderful list of authors includingSunday Times bestsellers KaterinaDiamond, who writes crime, and Kitty Neale who writes saga. I’ve just startedworking on C.L Taylor’s psychological thrillers too, which get more brilliantwith every book. Her latest, The Fear,will be out in 2018. The first book I acquired for HarperCollins was called Obsession by Amanda Robson, which wasso much fun to work on, and the second was 99Red Balloons by Elisabeth Carpenter which has one of the cleverest plottwists I’ve ever read. Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I actually trained as a journalist which gave me a goodgrounding in the skills needed for publishing, particularly meeting tightdeadlines, writing short, snappy copy and liaising with other people. I’ve alsodone several proof reading courses, and of course, I’m a huge reader – myKindle is my prized possession and I think you have to read an awful lot inorder to get a feel for what will and won’t sell in the competitive commercialmarket. I’m part of the events team for the Society of Young Publishers andthat has been very helpful too; I’ve met so many wonderful, inspiring peoplethrough the SYP who have all helped to get me where I am today. How do you relax after a busy working day?It can be hard to relax in my job because it does spill overinto my home life because I’ve always got submissions to read and several bookson the go, but to switch off I love a good drama, something like The Affair or Happy Valley. I’m a writer as well and at times, that can berelaxing – if the book is going well, that is! Otherwise, it’s essentiallywine… What was the last book you read for pleasure?I read and thoroughly enjoyed Conversations with Friends by Sally Rooney, a more literary novelabout relationships, friendship and the confusion of being a young woman. Iabsolutely loved it from beginning to end and would highly recommend. I alsodevoured Maggie O’Farrell’s memoir, I AmI Am I Am, which tells the story of her seventeen brushes with death – areally fascinating read with her trademark beautiful writing style. Describe your job in 15 words or less...Getting paid to read and drink lots of tea! What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farOoh, I think probably getting the job at HarperCollins, asI’d always wanted to make the move into fiction and it was just so exciting tofinally do so. And acquiring my first book was a moment I’ll never forget, Iwent across the road with a colleague afterwards and had a celebratory glass ofwine! I’m incredibly proud of all of my authors and their books and it isamazing seeing them fly up the charts and into readers’ hands. I’m also veryproud of everything the SYP have achieved – I worked on our London Conferencein 2016 and seeing it all come together after months of planning was brilliant. If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I’ve always wanted to see what being a lawyer would be like– but I’m essentially too lazy to spend so much time on paperwork! I’d onlywant to do the exciting parts, like arguing in court in an Ally McBeal-esqueoutfit…a bit unrealistic, I’m sure, but it always looked so much fun to build acase and convince a jury of the truth. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Hmm, probably something like Fake It Til You Make It – I always felt like such an imposter whenI was first starting out in publishing, and it’s only recently that I’vestarted to feel more confident and I think that’s a sensation a lot of peopledeal with too. But it is true – if you keep going at something and pretendyou’re confident even when you’re not, eventually, true confidence will come.Thanks so much for taking part, Phoebe!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "Before It's Too Late by Sara Driscoll", "date": "Wednesday 25 October 2017", "text": "Before It's Too LateBy Sara DriscollPublished by Kensington Books (26 September 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley.Publisher's descriptionIn this powerful K-9 crime thriller, FBI Special Agent MegJennings and her trusted search-and-rescue Labrador, Hawk, must raceagainst the clock before a diabolical killer strikes againSomewhere in the Washington, D.C., area, a womanlies helpless in a box. Beneath the earth. Barely breathing. Buried alive. InQuantico, the FBI receives a coded message from the woman’s abductor. He wantsto play a game with them: decipher the clues, find the grave, save the girl.The FBI’s top cryptanalysts crack the code and Special Agent Meg Jennings andher K-9 partner, Hawk, scramble to the scene of the crime. Cryptic clues leadthem astray and by the time they solve the puzzle, it’s too late. But thekiller’s game is far from over . . .Soon another message arrives. Another victim istaken, and the deadly pattern is repeated—again and again. Each kidnappingtriggers another desperate race against time, each with the possibility ofanother senseless death. That’s when Meg decides to try something drastic.Break the Bureau’s protocol. Bring in her brilliant sister, Cara, a genius atword games, to decipher the kidnapper’s twisted clues. Meg knows she’s riskingher career to do it, but she’s determined not to let one more person die underher and Hawk’s watch. If the plan fails, it could bite them in the end. And ifit leads to the killer, it could bury them forever . . .My verdictI loved Lone Wolf, Sara Driscoll's first FBI K9 crime thriller. I found that to be a fast-paced read and a great start to the series. I couldn't put Before It's Too Late down either.This is an emotional book from the outset. A woman is buried alive somewhere in Washington, D.C. On receiving a coded message, Special Agent Meg Jenning and her dog Hawk have a race against the clock to find the victim, but unfortunately it's too late. Then another woman goes missing and another coded message arrives...Before It's Too Late is a great lesson in pacing and plotting. It's well-researched too, though the references to American history did pass me by - I'm not great on British history, let alone US history - but that didn't detract from the plot at all. The book is filled with thrills, action and suspense, and I'm sure I barely took a breath for most of it.This crime thriller has plenty of heart, featuring some great teamwork, not just between the human characters but also between the humans and their canine partners (especially Meg with Hawk, her Labrador). So pleased that helpful journalist McCord back is back - journalists are often depicted very negatively in crime fiction. Love the return of Todd, Meg's firefighter boyfriend, too.You get to know a lot about Meg's family life and background - she even involves her sister Cara (a whizz at codes and puzzles), which puts Meg's career on the line. As she embarks on this cat-and-mouse chase, she realises this is personal - and her past is coming back to haunt her.While I'm sure Before It's Too Late could be read as a standalone, I still think it's a good idea to read Lone Wolf first - partly because you'll be missing out on another good book if you don't. This is turning out to be a favourite series of mine - and I can't wait for the next book!"},
{"title": "Witch Dust by Marilyn Messik", "date": "Tuesday 24 October 2017", "text": "Witch DustBy Marilyn MessikPublished by Matador (12 June 2017)I received a copy from the author.Publisher's descriptionA red gash of a mouth rimmedwith impossibly tiny, razor-sharp teeth yawned wide, then swift as a snake, shebent and struck…For Sandra, daughter ofillusionists, Adam and Ophelia, life’s never been run of the mill! But whenAdam’s wandering eye lights on yet another conquest, it proves a chorus girltoo far, and Sandra’s caught in the reverberations of her parents acrimoniousparting. Coerced into restoring her depressed Mother to the bosom of a familySandra never knew existed, she’s sucked into a situation that even for her isunnerving.From being without a singlerelative, she suddenly acquires several she’d rather do without, and learns afew home truths she’d prefer not to know. Ophelia, it appears, has not beenentirely honest about any number of things. There’s no doubt in Sandra’s mind,the sooner she puts as much distance as possible between herself, her newlydiscovered nearest and dearest, their peculiar tendencies and their failinghotel business, the happier she’s going to be.Dire straits call fordesperate measures and Sandra reluctantly rises to the occasion. A hangedhousemaid, a fly-on-the-wall documentary, The Psychic Society and a quasico-operative journalist all handled correctly should, she reckons, get thefamily business up and running, which will allow her to do the same – as fast asshe can, and in the opposite direction. Things unfortunately move swiftly frombad to farce and then get a hell of a lot darker. One moment Sandra’sstruggling to save the family’s income, the next, she’s battling to save theirlives. Turns out, some darknesses, once buried, are best left undisturbed.My verdictWitch Dust was great fun to read. It's about a hotel in financial crisis, a completely unconventional upbringing and, literally, life-changing family secrets.Sandra has very dysfunctional parents - there's no other way to describe them. But it's only when she agrees to help her mother, Ophelia, recover from depression that she discovers her parents are just the tip of a very wobbly iceberg. When her mother leads her to a failing hotel filled with eccentric relatives (a family Sandra didn't even know existed), Sandra soon learns that there's no such thing as 'normal'.This book is a combination of Bewitched and Harry Potter, filled with magic, as Sandra discovers her family's talents - and some of her own. I laughed my way through most of it - plenty of dark humour in here. And the characters were so brilliantly described that they felt very real - whether I grew to love them or hate them. I think this book cast a spell on me as I raced through most of it, loving the rollercoaster story and the diversity of the people in it. I found myself willing good to win the battle against evil yet again.Witch Dust is certainly something a little different. A great Halloween read, especially if you love paranormal and fantasy."},

{"title": "Another Woman's Husband by Gill Paul", "date": "Wednesday 18 October 2017", "text": "Another Woman's HusbandBy Gill PaulPublished by Headline Review (17 August 2017)Publisher's descriptionTwo women who challenged the Crown.Divided by time. Bound by a secret...1997Rachel's romantic break in Paris with her fiancé ends in tragedy when the carahead crashes. Inside was Princess Diana. Back in Brighton, Rachel is haunted by the accident, andintrigued to learn the princess had visited the last home of Wallis, Duchess ofWindsor, only hours before the crash. Soon, the discovery of a long-forgottenlink to Wallis Simpson leads Rachel to the truth behind a scandal that shook theworld.1911At the age of fifteen, carefree Mary Kirk and indomitable Wallis Warfield meetat summer camp. Their friendship will survive heartbreaks, separation and thedemands of the British Crown until it is shattered by one unforgivablebetrayal...My verdictAnother Woman's Husband provided a welcome break from all of my usual crime reads. It was a timely read too - around the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death.This dual time frame novel is set in 1911 onwards and also 1997, focusing on the life of Wallis Simpson and the death of Princess Diana. This book is very much about the reaction to Diana's death, told through the eyes of Alex and Rachel in 1997, rather than about Diana's life. Wallis' story is mainly told through the eyes of her friend Mary Kirk.I don't feel that I preferred one thread more than the other. Both were filled with believable characters that jumped out of the page, fascinating periods of history and compelling storytelling. I did find it easier to relate to the 1997 thread though, as I still remember where I was when I first heard about Princess Diana's accident.Gill Paul certainly knows how to write a gripping story and it's clear that she also does a lot of research. This is a fascinating insight into the young woman who became Wallis Simpson, creating a national scandal, and also the public's reaction to the death of Diana, the People's Princess. Until I read this book, I didn't know much about Wallis Simpson's background (since I'm far more of a scientist than a historian). It's a clever idea to involve Alex and Rachel in the Diana story themselves, through Alex's job as a television producer making a documentary and Rachel's job as a vintage clothing shop owner. Their story provided a clever link between the two time frames.Another Woman's Husband is a beautifully written story of loss, hope, dreams, friendship, tragedy, secrets and betrayal. It seamlessly weaves fact and fiction together to provide a perfect blend of past and present (well 1997, rather than 2017). It's an easy read, with subtle twists and turns and ups and downs, taking the reader on a journey through time.Highly recommended!"},

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome JAMIE COWENDirectorofThe Ampersand AgencyWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first role in publishing was as a Contracts Assistant atHarperCollins, which I started during 2002. It was the only interview I gotfrom around a dozen applications for entry-level positions, and I got the job! Mumwas so proud. How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve been an agent with Ampersand for just over four years.Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?In the last few months I’ve been working on It Was Her, Mark Hill’s terrificfollow-up to Two O’Clock Boy; awonderful and yet-to-be-submitted real-world YA novel called Dealer No. 1, which is Billy Elliot crossed with Breaking Bad; and an upcoming sci-fithriller called  Steel Frame featuringa conscripted convict flying her artificially intelligent mech into a blackhole. This last is written by a frighteningly talented South African writercalled Andrew Skinner. Keep an eye out for him… Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?My work in contracts gave me plenty: negotiation skills,attention to detail and a total absence of fear when dealing with the legal aspectsof publishing. Latterly, my time as an editor confirmed what I already suspected:that working with authors to make their books better, then selling them to thewider world, is my dream job. But really, my family’s obsession with readingbooks then discussing them endlessly is arguably the most applicable life skillto my current role as an agent. It’s pretty much what we get paid for, whichreally isn’t work when you think about it. In terms of life skills, I thinkthat resilience and determination are crucial in our job as agents. We facerejection on a regular basis, and the ability to think clearly through adversitythen learn from any mistakes is hugely important. How do you relax after a busy working day?In my rare moments of downtime I play amateur football (fornorth London’s finest, Alexandra Park FC). Although you’re never truly off theclock as an agent; there’s always another intriguing submission to read, or aneditor to berate… What was the last book you read for pleasure?I read Nicholas Eames’ Kingsof the Wyld whilst on holiday in France this summer. It’s a brilliantfantasy novel that balances tongue-in-cheek humour with sharp, heart-meltingpathos. I loved it. Describe your job in 15 words or less...I help talented writers become published authors. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farThe real highlights of being an agent are the simple things:hearing the excitement in an author’s voice when you tell them of an offer,finally getting the chance to pitch a spectacular new book to publishers,reading the first few lines of a submission and knowing it’s going to blow yoursocks off, and – best of all – holding a finished book in your hand. Those arethe really good bits. If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?Astronaut. Is there any other answer? If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?That’s really hard! Ok, let’s go with Tell It Like It Is. I’ve always tried to be honest and direct in mycareer, so that’ll do.

Agatha Christie, for giving us the masterful Hercule Poirot, andI’m going to throw in George Pelecanos,for the comprehensive detail in some of his storytelling. ... FILMS/MOVIESThe Godfather 1 & 2. What great adaptations of Mario Puzo’sbooks, and they are done so well. The acting is out of this world from Sonny(James Caan) to Michael (Al Pacino) and Connie (Talia Shire) and of course TheDon (Marlon Brando). ... TV DRAMASIt’s difficult to ignore The Wire for its sheer scope in storytellingbut there’s also Romanzo Criminale which charts the rise of Italianfriends, Lebanese, Freddo and Dandi. It’s pretty much in-your-face stuff but it’sfrighteningly engrossing, watching these friends make their way up in the crimeunderworld. I thought Southland was really good too, as it brought asharp sense of realism, no matter how uncomfortable. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’m going togo for Patrick Bateman from AmericanPyscho.

With her back to the wall, she resorts to smuggling cocaine into Iceland, and finds herself caught up in a ruthless criminal world. As she desperately looks for a way out of trouble, she must pit her wits against her nemesis, Bragi, a customs officer, whose years of experience frustrate her new and evermore daring strategies. Things become even more complicated by the fact that Sonja is in a relationship with a woman, Agla. Once a high-level bank executive, Agla is currently being prosecuted in the aftermath the Icelandic financial crash.Set in a Reykjavík still covered in the dust of the Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption, and with a nail-bitingly fast-paced and chilling plot and intriguing characters, Snare is an outstandingly original and sexy Nordic crime thriller, from one of the most exciting new names in crime fiction.My verdictSnare is fresh and different, raw yet sophisticated with fleshed out characters and beautiful literary writing. This is a very dark yet easy read, with plenty of heart within its pages. Both drug-smuggling young mother Sonja and soon-to-retire customs officer Bragi have hard exteriors yet are soft inside once you delve further into their lives. I found myself wanting a happy ending for both characters, even though in Sonja's case I realised I shouldn't - she's smuggling cocaine, a drug that is likely to kill people and ruin lives. Yet I just couldn't help but feel for her, stuck in a situation with no easy way out and driven by her love for her young son. The airport scenes left me holding my breath - would Sonja find a way to beat the system?Snare is a cat and mouse game. It's a fast paced read, but it's not one filled with car chases. It's a slower, more intelligent and more measured chase. Sonja is always planning ahead, trying to keep one step ahead, but Bragi isn't far behind. He knows something is going on, but isn't quite sure who is involved or how - and even when he works out the who, he realises Sonja isn't a straightforward cocaine drugs mule. She doesn't fit the mould. I loved the depth not only of the characters, but also the situation they find themselves in - even Bragi isn't as 'straight laced' as he appears. Agla wasn't someone I warmed to so well. She's a businesswoman, and likes to be in control - a major problem for her as when she's with Sonja she isn't in control at all. She becomes someone she doesn't recognise - and someone she isn't sure she wants to be - but just can't help her feelings. She's being investigated for financial crimes - again something that's out of her control, and she feels trapped.This is a book about love - and how far people will go for it, whatever the consequences. A mother's love, a young son's love, a husband's love, a lover's love ... and maybe even a father's love. Love of money, drugs, sex, thrills and control. It's also a book about hate - and how far people will go for that too.Set in Iceland, with its short days and volcanic ash at a time of a major financial crash, Snare is a compelling, suspenseful and chilling thriller. I must also add that the translation by Quentin Bates is top notch - it doesn't read like a translation at all. I can't wait for the next book from Lilja Sigurdardottir. Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome SARAH WARDto share her BEST OF CRIME ......

AUTHORSThe Daddy for me will always be John le Carre. Hisperceptions of character are masterly, his writing so descriptive and thetension he creates is truly breath-taking. But underneath it all there is anaching sadness about what we’ve done – and continue to do – to our people andour beautiful planet. ... FILMS/MOVIESIt has to be The ThirdMan by Graham Greene. Even though it was filmed nearly 70 years ago, thedrama is just as fresh. Orson Welles stole the show but the moody backstreetsand haunting zither music set the scene perfectly. I went to Vienna to researchThe C Clef and found myself hummingthe tune.    ... TV DRAMASI wondered how they were going to portray The Night Manager as a TV Drama, giventhe complexity of the plot. It proved to be a real winner. I don’t think a filmcould have done it justice. Tom Hiddleston seemed a natural choice for JonathanPine but the casting of Hugh Laurie as Richard Onslow Roper was a stroke of puregenius. Think I would have stuck to le Carre’s ending though, much darker.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI loved the animal complexity of Martin Vanger in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. We had thecharming façade of the sophisticated CEO who knew his way around a wine listand seemed to have everything under control. But his dark side could not beconstrained. A chilling reminder that evil will always choose its owndisciples.      ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Jo Nesbo’s finest creation – Harry Hole, which I discovered is pronounced ‘Hooola’. Hisunorthodox methods, flawed logic and vulnerability really got me wanting tohelp him. It’s not often you find yourself shouting at a book; C’mon Harry, pull yourself together, theyneed you!! It was great to see Nesbo’s writing style grow in confidenceover his early books. For me his masterpiece – and Harry’s finest hour - was The Snowman. ... MURDER WEAPONSFirstly I must salute Jo Nesbo for creating the deadly appledevice in The Leopard. I nearlychoked reading it! But my favourite murder weapon has to be the Katana, theancient sword of the Samurai warrior and weapon of choice for the coolest dude ofall time, Nicholas Linnear. I must thank Eric van Lustbader for bringing themagical world of the Ninja to myhungry adolescence.     ... DEATH SCENESI really enjoyed Dan Brown’s early novels and will alwaysshiver at the swirling mass of hammerhead sharks circling in Deception Point. It seemed impossible toescape certain death. Brilliant writing. For me his genius for stretching thereader’s imagination came with Angels andDemons: the trial by fire was amazing.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESGot to be Amazon and Wikipedia. I’ve stocked up my librarywith reference books through Amazon. And although I don’t believe everything Iread on Wikipedia, it is a brilliant starting-off point for further research. Ioften wonder what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or HG Wells could have created withthe internet at their fingertips. ... WRITING TIPSBest advice – keep going. Sometimes the words just flow,other times every word is a struggle. But keep going and enjoy it. The story isin there trying to get out – your job is to let it. And don’t listen to thenegatives. It’s your story, you tell it your way. If people don’t like it, theycan read something else. Nobody dies, at least not in real life.... WRITING SNACKSGod invented marmite for a reason! The blessed union ofmarmite on toast, washed down with a mug of Yorkshire tea, has to be theultimate writing snack. New Zealand marmite is a sad imitation – a miserablesavoury plum jam. But you can still get the real thing over here. And Lurpakbutter. It must be full of creative antioxidants!About ANDREW HARRISAndrew Harris was born in Liverpool, survived a grammarschool education and graduated from the University of Leeds.

{"title": "Race to the Kill by Helen Cadbury - blog tour", "date": "Wednesday 4 October 2017", "text": "It's my turn on the blog tour for Race to the Kill by Helen Cadbury. Race to the Kill was published by Allison & Busby on 21 September 2017.Helen was one of the first crime authors I was in contact with before I even started blogging. She was one of the loveliest people I met in the book world. She supported everyone within the book community, from bloggers and reviewers to authors and publishers. I last saw her at the 2016 CrimeFest in Bristol, where she always had a smile on her face. Sadly, she passed away in June 2017. Race to the KillBy Helen CadburyPublished by Allison & Busby (21 September 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionIt is themiddle of a long night shift for PC Sean Denton and his partner PC GavinWentworth when they are approached by a dishevelled-looking woman desperatethat they follow her. She leads them to the old Chasebridge High School wherethey find the dead body of a Syrian refugee. The investigation which points tothe neighbouring greyhound stadium finds Denton caught up in a world ofimmigration, drugs and sexual abuse, and one in which his private life becomesincreasingly entwined.  My verdictI read the first book in Helen Cadbury's Sean Denton series (To Catch a Rabbit) a couple of years ago, when I first made contact with Helen. I immediately warmed to Sean Denton and Helen's Yorkshire setting. Like so many books, the next book in the series, Bones in the Nest, sat on my 'To Be Read' pile and I assured Helen so many times that I would 'get to it'. As soon as I was asked to take part in the blog tour for this third book, Race to the Kill, I took Bones in the Nest off my shelf and read it so that I was up to date.As with the first two books, I loved Race to the Kill from the start. This is character-led crime fiction, mixing police procedural with believable characters. Sean has now worked his way up from PCSO to PC, not letting his dyslexia get in the way of his career progression. He is a very bright and determined character who will do everything he can to investigate a crime. This makes a change from most other police procedurals, which tend to focus on more senior officers. Sean has a complicated family life too, which ends up intertwined with his professional life in this book.There are two parallel stories here. Firstly, that of a homeless man found beaten to death at an abandoned school. And secondly, that of a young woman, Sarah, who lives at the local greyhound course, next to the school. The story is told through three distinct voices - that of Sean, his half-sister Chloe and Sarah. There's clearly a link somewhere, and the clues gradually reveal themselves in a twisty gripping plot.Race to the Kill is very much a crime novel of modern times, covering key social issues such as drug use, poverty, sexual abuse, homelessness and refugees. I was totally absorbed from beginning to end, and felt very sad when I reached the final pages, realising that this is the last Sean Denton book.Helen Cadbury was a talented writer, a warm person and is sadly missed.Follow the Blog Tour"},

James - blog tour", "date": "Tuesday 3 October 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Sleep No More, a collection of six short stories by P.D. James. Sleep No More is published by Faber & Faber today, 3 October 2017.Sleep No MoreBy P.D. JamesPublished by Faber & Faber (3 October 2017)Publisher's descriptionAs the six murderous tales unfold, the dark motive ofrevenge is revealed at the heart of each. Bullying schoolmasters receive theircomeuppance, unhappy marriages and childhoods are avenged, a murder in thesmall hours of Christmas Day puts an end to the vicious new lord of the manor,and, from the safety of his nursing home, an octogenarian exerts exquisiteretribution.The punishments inflicted on the guilty are fittinglysevere, but here they are meted out by the unseen forces of natural justicerather than the institutions of the law. Once again, P. D. James shows herexpert control of the short-story form, conjuring motives and scenarios withcomplete conviction, and each with a satisfying twist in the tail.My verdictSleep No More contains six short stories filled with murder and intrigue. All are very twisty tales, featuring varied voices, settings and characters, proving P.D. James' versatility as a writer. This book offers a masterclass in the planning, plotting and execution of short stories that not only entertain and thrill but also explore the dark nature of humanity.P.D. James has given 'Golden Age of Crime'-style stories an emotional and psychological feel, fitting in well with current trends of psychological thrillers and domestic noir. These are all tales of revenge and justice, filled with dark humour and highly atmospheric writing.Which was my favourite? I'm torn between three of the stories: The Yo-Yo (very disturbing school boy memories), The Victim (very much in the vein of today's psychological thrillers) and Mr Millcroft's Birthday (which made me laugh).Sleep No More packs a powerful punch. This is a perfect Christmas stocking filler for a crime fiction addict.Follow the Blog Tour"},

{"title": "Laura Wilkinson's Writing Toolkit", "date": "Thursday 28 September 2017", "text": "WRITING TOOLKIT gives you an idea of an author's writing process through the tools they use. The tools can be anything (real or virtual) that they think is essential for their writing - serious, fun or even a fetish (that they're willing to own up to)! I am delighted to welcome LAURA WILKINSONAUTHOR OF SKIN DEEPTO SHARE HER WRITING TOOLKITAn ideaOne with legs. I have lots of ideas but theydon’t all have legs or those that are strong enough. Thinking a lot is part ofbeing a writer and why gazing out of a window constitutes work. Sometimes.A notebookStationery, I love it! There’s a fantasticshop in the North Laine here in Brighton; it’s great to go in and dribble overthe exquisite notebooks even when I don’t need another one. I have a newnotebook at the start of a new project in which I pour every thought and idea –regardless of how bonkers they seem. I keep it by my bed at night. It’s easy tobelieve that when we’re struck by a ‘brilliant’ idea, we will remember itbecause, well, it’s brilliant. I have learnt to my cost this isn’t always so.Write everything down is one of my rules. Alongside my novel notebook, I havean ‘everyday’ one, which I carry everywhere, transferring to another book whenI’m home – and another for my editing and mentoring jobs, plus a spare.My writing denUntil March of this year I worked inwhichever corner of our average-to-small sized house I could squeeze into: mybedroom, the dining room, the living room. My husband is a musician andcarpenter; my eldest son plays guitar, my youngest piano, so I am forevertripping over instruments and gear. I work best without distraction or noise soit’s a pleasure and privilege to escape to my den. I find a beautiful spaceconducive to creativity and I wonder now how I ever managed.Post-it notesAs you can see I am a huge fan of post-itnotes of all sizes and colours. I use them to map out a narrative – notimmediately, I’m not that much of a planner. It’s something I do once I’maround a third in. Commonly, I begin a novel knowing where the story kicks offand roughly where it might end, though I will often be surprised by mycharacters who lead me down a different path to the one I anticipated. I usesmall post-its to tag a MS once I’ve done ‘the big read through’ – differentcolours mean different things: yellow to cut or move a scene, blue where themajor plot points are and so on. I use them to write character essence quotesand stick them around the screen; I write useful maxims like ‘action notactivity’ on them and stick them around the screen and on my desk. I’msurprised I can see the screen at all by the time I write ‘The End’.Microsoft WordI have friends who swear by Scrivener and Idid try it for a month. There was a lot I liked about it – the ability to movescenes around quickly and easily for one thing, the cork board another – but inthe end I reverted to Word because the MS looked so ugly when pieced togetherfor printing. I am sure with more time, I could learn how to prettify it but Iwas up against a deadline. I worked as a journalist and copywriter beforeturning to fiction so Word has been one of my best working friends since themid-90s and I am so used to it and competent with it too that it’s hard toabandon. I cannot imagine writing a novel long hand. Notes I write in pencilbut in terms of an actual narrative – novel or short story or article – nothingseems ‘real’ till it’s before me on screenNo internetMy attention span often resembles that of a feeble-mindedgnat. Social media is both my best friend and worst enemy. When the den wasfinished I decided it would be an internet free zone. Of course, I can accessthe internet on my iPad and phone and will do for the teeny-tiny researchpoints… but not having access on the desktop does help me focus. Tea and cakePlenty of herbal tea (and the occasional mugof builder’s) keeps me going, along with ‘reward’ slabs of cake: Battenberg,French Fancies, Fruit, Lemon Drizzle. As long as it’s sweet I’m sorted – whichis more than can be said for my waistline during intense periods of writing. Iadore my teapot, cup and saucer set gifted from a dear friend.A blanketClothes are not important to me when writing(very important otherwise – I love all things concerning fashion and style),though I do wash, brush my hair and slap on make-up sometimes. But my blanket…that is important. I have heating in my writing den but I do not possess thebest circulation in the world and get cold easily.  Sometimes I don’t move for hours. My blanketis my saviour. That and fingerless gloves in winter.These are some of the drills, screws andratchets I use for writing. But everyone’s toolbox – or shed – is stockeddifferently.

Today, Phoebe talks about her own writing rituals and traditions. The Doll House was published by HQ Digital on 14 September 2017.Writing rituals and traditionsBy Phoebe MorganI usuallywrite best in the evenings. I like to have (depending on the mood and the sortof day I’ve had!) either a good cup of tea or a glass of red wine, and I’lleither seat myself at the table in our living room or (I know, it’s bad) in mybed. I find it easier to write if I am comfortable (hence the bed) and thereforeI can’t distract myself with things like my back hurting or my chair beinguncomfy. That’s if I’m writing at home. With The Doll House, I actually did a lot of the writing in cafes –there is a crepe place in Angel Islington, which is my favourite because it haslovely yellow flowers on the tables, and I spent a weird amount of time in Pretby Leicester Square as well when my offices used to be over that way. When I’mwriting, I can’t have any music or podcasts on – I used to be the same when Istudied at school or at university. I don’t mind the sound of people talking ina café, but I can’t have headphones playing because it just distracts me too much.If I really need to get some serious word count going, I have to put my phonein another room so that I don’t fiddle with it (I’m terrible for playing withmy phone). I have to train myself to leave it in the other room for an hour orso at a time, and that’s usually when I can actually be most productive.If I’mwriting at home, I quite like having a candle lit as it’s softer than a lightand can be quite calming. I usually have a notebook and pen to hand to in caseI need to scribble notes down for future scenes, and I can then refer to mycharacter notes as I go too. I do keep little lists in my iPhone as well, whenI’m out and about – most of which I look back on in utter bafflement. For example,looking now at one from when I was editing TheDoll House, it says: court case, rich girl’s shoes, her face flushes,repetitive is terrible when they’re in the loft, high chair, remove full stop.Not particularly helpful to anyone other than me, and not always then. I writelittle observations as well if I see something interesting in a café orwherever – recently on holiday I liked the way a sailboat was trailing acrossthe sea so I made a note saying ‘boat white line.’ Not overly coherent!I reallyadmire authors who get up at the crack of dawn and bash out 2000 words, butI’ve come to accept the fact that that will probably never be me. I write asmuch as I can around a full time job, and when I get into it, I love every minute– especially if I’ve gone for the red wine rather than the tea!About Phoebe MorganPhoebe Morgan is a commercial fiction editor as part of Avon atHarperCollins publishers working on crime, thrillers, women’s fiction and saga. She started out in publishing working as a non-fictionpublishing assistant.Find Phoebe on her website and Facebook page and follow her on Twitter - @Phoebe_A_MorganAbout The Doll HouseThe Doll HouseBy Phoebe MorganPublished by HQ Digital (14 September 2017)Publisher's descriptionYou never know who’swatching…Corinne’s life might lookperfect on the outside, but after three failed IVF attempts it’s her lastchance to have a baby.

Snow Sisters was published by Honno Press on 21 September 2017.Snow SistersBy Carol LovekinPublished by Honno Press (21 September 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionTwo sisters, theirgrandmother’s old house and Angharad... the girl who cannot leave.Meredith discovers a dustysewing box in a disused attic. Once open the box releases the ghost ofAngharad, a Victorian child-woman with a horrific secret she must share.Angharad slowly reveals her story to Meredith who fails to convince her morepragmatic sister of the visitations, until Verity sees Angharad for herself onthe eve of an unseasonal April snowstorm.Forced by her flighty motherto abandon Gull House for London, Meredith struggles to settle, still hauntedby Angharad and her little red flannel hearts. This time, Verity is not sureshe will be able to save her...My verdictSnow Sisters is a wonderful book, with beautiful writing and eerie and haunting prose.This is a ghost story filled with magic. A story of relationships, mothers and daughters and family dynamics. A story with a mystery at its heart. It ticked so many boxes and I couldn't put it down.Meredith and Verity have had a very unconventional upbringing. Home schooling, a dysfunctional mother and an absent father who they know little about , set in an isolated house filled with memories and ghosts. This highly atmospheric book is a gothic tale set in April, with snow clouds threatening overhead, bringing a sense of unease but also natural beauty.It's an enchanting and addictive read filled with stunning descriptions of people and places. Descriptions that filled my heart and stimulated all of my senses, bringing people, nature and surroundings to life. So many passages that I wanted to read again and again, filled with amazing imagery that will stay with me.The characterisation is outstanding, with several distinctive voices - Verity, Meredith, their mother Allegra (who is almost a ghost herself with her lack of empathy and her emotional distance from her daughters), grandmother Mared (the main female role model for the girls) and ghostly Angharad (who is determined to be heard - and then seen). No major male characters here - this is definitely a book about women.The story itself is quirky, different and off-beat, with poetic writing. Although it is a ghost story, it feels very believable. Angharad seems as real as Meredith, Verity and the other characters. It is sad in places and pulled at my heartstrings and yes, I did shed a tear or two by the end.Snow Sisters is a book that's so easy to get lost in. A perfect book for escapism on cold wintry nights. I highly recommend that people read it so that they can feel the magic too.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "MY PUBLISHING LIFE with Hannah Robinson ", "date": "Wednesday 20 September 2017", "text": "Welcome to MY PUBLISHING LIFE, an interview with a literary agent, publisher, publicist or editor about their publishing career to date. Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome HANNAH ROBINSONPublicity Directorat Quercus BooksWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first job was PA to the MD at the independent publisherMichael O’Mara, where I worked for almost four years. It was a very varied rolewhich touched on rights, special sales, PR and office management as well as PAduties. I enjoyed all of it but felt that my skills and personality suitedpublicity best and was lucky enough that a publicity job came up there and Isuccessfully got the role.How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve been at Quercus for coming up to four years. I joinedjust before the company was sold to Hachette so I’ve seen lots of changes butwe are having a great year and have lots of amazing books coming in 2018.  Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?We publish a wide range of books at Quercus but I tend tofocus on non-fiction and crime fiction. On the fiction side I’m heading intoautumn with our biggest crime book of the year The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye by David Lagercrantz, the nextin Stieg Larsson’s Millennium series and the new Elly Griffiths The Vanishing Box. On the non-fictionside I’m working with one of our biggest non-fiction authors Damien Lewis on afantastic WW2 book SAS Ghost Patrol andI’m super excited about the new lifestyle book The Little Book of Ikigai by Ken Mogi which I know is going to be apopular gift purchase this Christmas.   Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I’ve got a degree in Art and English but I didn’t gostraight into publishing from university and I think that helped. I also thinkworking in a small publisher at the start of my publishing career was reallyhelpful because I got to see and understand how different of areas of thebusiness worked. Those entry level office assistant roles might seemunglamorous but they can allow you the time to learn before choosing what you’dlike to specialise in. How do you relax after a busy working day?I love interior design and sewing and am planning to set upa blog later this year. For now, you can see what I’m up to on Instagram: @Hannah_is_sewing! What was the last book you read for pleasure?I just finished He Said/She Said by Erin Kelly which Ithought was excellent. It’s just a bit different from a lot of psychologicalcrime and I finished it the day of the eclipse which if you’ve read the bookyou’ll know is quite relevant. Describe your job in 15 words or less...I tell people how great our books are and ask them to tellother people.What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farBeing part of unexpected successes like Norwegian Wood byLars Mytting winning Book of the Year at the British Book Awards last year, wethought we had something special in that book but none of us expected it to beso big. I used to do a lot of celebrity books and had some amazing (ifsometimes stressful) times with huge book tours. It’s one of the few parts of apublicist’s job where you can immediately see the effect of your work in booksales. Also, seeing my team do well, for example Elizabeth Masters winning aPPC Award (publishing publicity campaign award) for our Enid Blyton for Adultsseries Five Go and Olivia Mead being named one of The Bookseller’s Rising Starsthis year. If you could try out any other job for one day (with no limits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?I’d be a house renovator/ interior designer. I’m in theprocess of renovating and redecorating our new flat which has been hard workbut I really enjoy it. If I had lots of money I’d buy old houses and do themup. If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?Oh God, this is why I’m a publicist and not an editor!Something like: Blagging It: A memoir of white wine and Twitter.  Follow Hannah on Twitter: @Hannah_RobboFollow Hannah on Instagram (books): @Hannah_RobboThanks so much for taking part, Hannah!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.Click here to read more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, please contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "Ngaio Marsh Awards Blog Tour: In Dark Places by Michael Bennett", "date": "Tuesday 19 September 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for the Ngaio Marsh Awards. I've read and reviewed the true crime book In Dark Places by Michael Bennett, which is one of the finalists for the Best Non-fiction Award.The Ngaio Marsh Award for Best Crime Novel (popularly calledthe Ngaio) is a literary award presented annually in New Zealand to recogniseexcellence in crime fiction, mystery, and thriller writing. The Award wasestablished by journalist and crime fiction reviewer Craig Sisterson in 2010,and is named after Dame Ngaio Marsh, one of the four Queens for Crime of theGolden Age of Detective Fiction. The Award has traditionally been presentedeach year in Christchurch, the hometown of Dame Ngaio.In Dark Placesby Michael BennettPublished by Bookbaby (4 April 2016)Publisher's descriptionTeina Pora, a 17-year-old carthief, was wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder ofSusan Burdett, who had been beaten to death with the softball bat she kept nextto her bed for her own protection.Tim McKinnel, en ex-copturned private investigator, discovered the long forgotten case 18 years later,saw an injustice had been done and set out to win Teina’s freedom. Reaching from the meanstreets of South Auckland to the highest court in the Commonwealth, this is thestory not just of Tim’s quest, but also of how an innocent man who was leftrotting in a prison cell for two decades found the inner strength to rise abovethe dark places to which he had been condemned.My verdictIn Dark Places is one of the best books I've read all year. The story is not only fascinating but also heart-breaking - of a man sentenced to life in prison for murder, a crime he didn't commit. And of the 18 years he spent there (more than half his life) before he was finally freed.I was glued to the story of New Zealander Teina Pora and private investigator Tim McKinnel's quest to determine the truth about Susan Burdett's death. The book is compelling and fast-paced from the outset and reads like fiction.There are cliffhangers, twists and turns, tensions and drama - everything you'd expect to find in a crime novel. Except this isn't fiction -  these are real life events and real people involved. I had to keep reminding myself of that. With his brilliant writing, Michael Bennett makes the people, places and events leap out of the pages.The police procedure, legal framework and forensics are described in detail, yet very easy to understand. During his research, Tim McKinnel explored the science of false confessions and racism in the New Zealand justice system. This devastating miscarriage of justice left me with one word:Why?In Dark Places is perfect for true crime fans and those who followed Making a Murderer. But I also urge people who don't usually read true crime to pick up this book. I hadn't read any true crime for years, but now, thanks In Dark Places, I'll be reading lots more.I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Michael is taking part in my new blog feature, sharing his essential writing toolkit. House of Spines was published by Orenda Books on 15 September 2017.I am delighted to welcome MICHAEL J MALONEAUTHOR OF HOUSE OF SPINESTO SHARE HIS WRITING TOOLKITBackground TVWhen I moved into my current home the floored attic space was a big draw. The plan was to geta nice desk, line the walls with bookcases – and have a comfy armchair for writingbreaks, or for reading my research. It would be quiet and peaceful and withoutdistractions. I did all that, but I’ve never actually written there, Instead, Iwrite at my dining room table with the telly on in the background.Laptop standThatinitially caused me neck and shoulder pain. Not sure why. A combination of thetable height and my chair perhaps. A quick question to my friends on Facebookand someone recommended a stand for my laptop to lift the top of the screen toeye level. This necessitated a free sitting keyboard and mouse (you try typinginto a laptop keyboard that’s sitting at an angle.) From the very first writingsession, the pain vanished.CoffeeCoffee is a must,to get me going in the morning. I use an espresso pot and it has to be myfavourite thing in the house.YouTubeIt turns out Ineed some noise in the background while I’m writing. Hence the neglect of mynoise- free zone in the attic. I’ll either have the TV on a low volume –without choosing any programme in particular. Or I bring up YouTube and selecta musical backdrop. The last one I worked to was a two hour long selection ofMozart. Apparently listening to him increases your I.Q. I have no idea if itworked or not. My son gave me a strange look when I told him why I had chosenthat. As if to say, yeah, right.NotebooksI use a notebookfor each book I’m writing. I’ll take notes for research purposes and also jotdown ideas for plot and character development as they occur. I can’t be arsedwith the time it takes to set up any writing apps  – some writers swear by them – but I do needto keep track of the book as I write. So, I write up a very short breakdown ofeach chapter as I finish it, which means it’s less likely that I forget whatthe hell I’m banging on about.Gym (& paper towel & pen)I need toexercise to help keep me sane, so I always make sure I take a break to hit thegym. And often that break works well to help me winkle out plot problems as Ioften come up with solutions while sweating over a piece of exercise equipment.Cue me tearing off a piece of paper towel and borrowing a pen from a passinggym instructor.WiFiA famous authorsaid (I’m paraphrasing) that no writer could work with a functional WIFIsignal. Don’t you love a generalisation? It’s crucial for me. A quick search onGoogle – other search engines are available – often gets me out of a bind. Ialso take regular breaks online. A quick scan of FB or twitter – it’s like Ineed to temporarily connect with the world beyond my writing space - and I’mgood to go again.HuelDespite mywillingness to allow a social media distraction, I can’t be doing with the disruptionof having to make myself a meal when I’m in the zone. So I found this stuffcalled Huel. Perfect nutrition apparently. I just add a few scoops to 500ml ofwater with some frozen fruit and Bob’s your whatsit.THANKS FOR TAKING PART, MICHAEL!About Michael J MaloneMichaelMalone is a prize-winning poet and author who was born and brought up in theheart of Burns’ country, just a stone’s throw from the great man’s cottage inAyr.

A young, lonely and frustratedwriter, and suffering from mental-health problems, he discovers that hislong-dead mother was related to one of Glasgow's oldest merchant families. Notonly that, but Ran has inherited Newton Hall, a vast mansion that belonged tohis great-uncle, who it seems has been watching from afar as his estrangedgreat-nephew has grown up. Entering his new-found home, it seems Great-UncleFitzpatrick has turned it into a temple to the written word - the perfect placefor poet Ran. But everything is not as it seems. As he explores the Hall'sendless corridors, Ran's grasp on reality appears to be loosening. And then hecomes across an ancient lift; and in that lift a mirror. And in the mirror...the reflection of a woman...Here's a snippet of my reviewIn House of Spines, I felt like I was living the story with Ran - seeing what he saw, feeling what he felt. The pictures the author paints within his prose, of the smells, sounds and sights of old Newton Hall, are as chilling and disturbing as the story itself.To read the rest of my review of House of Spines, click here.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "The Man Who Died by Antti Tuomainen", "date": "Friday 15 September 2017", "text": "The Man Who DiedBy Antti TuomainenPublished by Orenda Books (10 October 2017)I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Publisher's descriptionA successful entrepreneur inthe mushroom industry, Jaakko Kaunismaa is a man in his prime. At just 37years of age, he is shocked when his doctor tells him that he's dying. What ismore, the cause is discovered to be prolonged exposure to toxins; in otherwords, someone has slowly but surely been poisoning him. Determined to find outwho wants him dead, Jaakko embarks on a suspenseful rollercoaster journey fullof unusual characters, bizarre situations and unexpected twists. My verdictThe Man Who Died's first line certainly welcomed me straight into protagonist Jaakko's nightmare diagnosis. He's just been told by his doctor that he's dying, being slowly poisoned by an unknown toxin, after experiencing a whole host of distressing symptoms.This leads into a black comedy as Jaakko tries to discover the culprit and why they have it in for him. There are plenty of potential poisoners in his life, considering his job is the successful entrepreneur in the mushroom industry. With some slapstick scenes, chases that don't go quite as planned, a whole host of bizarre characters and plenty of dark humour, Antti Tuomainen takes us on a journey into Jaako's working life and personal relationships. There's much philosophical discussion about life and death and hopes and dreams, with a running theme of betrayal (and also love).I was glued to this book. It made me laugh and grimace at times, and also made me sad. It's very different from anything else I've read in a while, with some brilliant twists that I really didn't see coming at all. The writing is stunning with vivid and intense descriptions of people and places - I could visualise it all so clearly. I learnt a lot about growing mushrooms too!Definitely a book for those who like something deliciously dark and delightfully different."},

AUTHORSThere are so many brilliant crime writersout there it's almost impossible to narrow it down to one, but I know I must soI will choose Agatha Christie. She was my introduction to crime novels –I would, ahem, borrow my mum's library books and read them under the covers bytorchlight, long after I was supposed to be asleep. Christie had an unrivalledtalent for weaving a compelling story within an intricately crafted framework, allwhile making it seem effortless.... FILMS/MOVIESGah, thisis so difficult. But Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill had a profound effecton me. Is there anything more kick-ass than a bride who seeks to avenge thewrongs wrought upon her in the most brutal of ways? I know some will balk atthe violence, but there is something incredibly powerful about a woman gettingit done (or maybe it's only me who has dark revenge fantasies...).... TV DRAMASI don'twatch a whole lot of television but I loved American Horror Story, abouta family who move into a house with a dark past. For me, it contained theperfect ratio of psychopathic killings and the supernatural. The openingcredits were so creepy I had to fast-forward them, though. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSDrHannibal Lecter.No-one else comes close. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Hmmm. Toughone. By rights, I should say Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, but I want tospread the love so I'm going to say  JohnConnolly's Charlie Parker, a private investigator and ex-cop with atragic past, who has to confront supernatural foes as well as human ones.... MURDER WEAPONSLamb tothe Slaughter, ashort story by Roald Dahl. Is there anything more genius than a housewife whokills her husband with a frozen leg of lamb and then serves up the murderweapon to the detectives investigating his violent demise?     ... DEATH SCENESInitially, I was going to talk about the icepick in Basic Instinct, but that got me thinking about the infamous rabbitscene from the 1987 film Fatal Attraction starring Glenn Close and MichaelDouglas. Close's character Alex, who has a fling with happily married Dan(played by Douglas), places his family's pet in a pot of boiling water on thestove. It's not a death scene as such (well, I guess it is for the rabbit), butthe threat is so implicit and so shocking that it spawned the phrase 'bunnyboiler', dictionary definition: a woman who acts vengefully after having beenspurned by her lover.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI often useforensic guides from individual police forces to help me with proceduralelements, and the internet is the perfect research tool.

AUTHORSI’m goingto say Raymond Chandler because it was partly through his work that Idiscovered crime fiction, though Daphne Du Maurier has a lot to answer for inthat regard as well. Were it not for devouring Chandler and Du Maurier when Ishould have been revising for my A-levels, I would probably not have got that Din chemistry. ... FILMS/MOVIESIabsolutely love almost everything the Coen Brothers have ever made, so it’s atie between their first movie, Blood Simple, and the later, brilliantly wittyFargo. There’s a kind of dark, macabre and yet grimly funny tone which I loveand is all their own, and they always manage to get amazing performances fromtheir cast. No one does dysfunctional small town America better.... TV DRAMASWe’re slapbang in the middle of a golden age of crime drama, so I’m surprising myself bypicking a relative oldie, The Sopranos. It’s art. Simple as that.... FICTIONAL KILLERSKathy Batesas Annie Wilkes in the movie adaptation of Stephen King’s Misery. I enjoycrackpots who think they are perfectly sane, and there are none more crackedthan Annie, romance writer Paul Sheldon’s ‘number one fan.’ Also a dark satireon the perils of success.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I know he’sa terrible womaniser and borderline misogynist, but I can’t help myself wantingto spend time with Philip Marlowe, for his droll wit and self-deprecatoryhumour.... MURDER WEAPONSThere was atrue crime case in the US not so long ago where a woman had attempted to killher husband by lacing her genitals with poison and persuading him to perform asex act. It really doesn’t get much weirder than that.    ... DEATH SCENESI can watchthe death scene in Thelma and Louise over and over on a loop.

I work best earlier on rather than later in the day. Many writers Iknow do it late into the night. That’s not for me. Aside from the fact that Iwork evenings in a theatre, my brain is mush once you get me past about six pm.I get up at about seven am, even if I’ve worked late the night before, and amat my desk by eight am. This is when my ideas and thoughts are the freshest.I’m usually good until about three pm (with lunch and a walk or work-out inbetween).TidinessI amtotally OCD. I cannot work in chaos. My head is a complete mess most of thetime, so I need my surroundings to be spotless and in order. I’m the first toadmit that I need serious help. But when my environment is immaculate I feel Ican go wild and let rip with the words. Makes no sense, but it’s true. Don’ttell anyone, but I can’t go to bed and leave messy cushions. There I’ve saidit. Come and cart me away.MusicOh, I needthat music. It inspires me. Certain songs get me in a certain mood. There areentire albums that remind me now of the time I wrote particular novels. I’lllisten to just about anything. At the moment I’m loving everything by TheWeeknd. His gritty, dark lyrics match the mood of novel five at times.SwearwordsI’mterrible for swearing. I’m not a very good typist (two fingers, one from eachhand, haha) and so there’s quite a bit of cursing when my brain goes fasterthan my hands can! Sometimes, if I forget someone else is on the house, theycome downstairs to ask who the heck I’m shouting at. So perhaps solitude shouldbe another essential, though it’s not likely to ever happen...My deskI onlywrite ‘properly’ at my desk. I scribble notes on physical bits of paper whileout and about, which I then import into my work. Now that I travel a lot morewith my writing, and all the events, I’m thinking of investing in a laptop. Butuntil then, my computer and my desk is the place I am for writing.TissuesI often crywhen writing. I do - I’m a big, fat wuss! If I’m writing an emotional scene, Ifeel every part of it. Just as if I write a funny scene, I tend to laugh outloud. These are even more reasons why no one should be near me when I write. Itreally isn’t pretty. I’m an OCD tidy, sweary, sobby mess.ExerciseWhensitting to write for long periods you can end up with your mind going incircles. So I usually take an hour out mid-write to either go fo a long hike ordo a work-out at home. Boxercise is great! You find that the ideas flood inwhen you’re physical! Plus there is of course the danger of eating too muchwhile sitting and I need to try and compensate for that. Of this I am alsoguilty.

Then one day she stopped calling me it. I try now to remember why, but I just can't.' Thirty-two-year-old Catherine Hope has a great memory. But she can't remember everything. She can't remember her ninth year. She can't remember when her insomnia started. And she can't remember why everyone stopped calling her Catherine-Maria.

But when she loses her home to the devastating deluge of 2007 and volunteers at Flood Crisis, a devastating memory emerges ... and changes everything.

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome ANNE WILLIAMSAssociate AgentatKate Hordern Literary AgencyWhat and when was your first job in publishing?My first permanent job was publicity assistant at VictorGollancz in the mid-1980s. Before that Idid a freelance project for Faber (paid £50) and worked on a non-fictionproposal, a mixture of Jane Fonda's Workout and Ignatius Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises, also paid £50, for Waterstones Publishers. Their idea. They asked me to be the author, but I declined… How long have you been working in your current job/role?Eight years. Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?I have just finished working through the first draft of anew cosy crime novel, a 21st-century Miss Marple, with aheroine who rehomes needy cats and dogs in Lincolnshire. I have just started working on the seconddraft of a spy novel from a very talented female author, with a UK heroine –really excited about this one now. I hope it’s nearing submission time. Again, a first novel. In the last six months I’ve been working onLyn Andrews’s new saga, The Liverpool Matchgirl and million-copy-ebookbestseller Kathryn Hughes’s third novel, The Key. Also Julie Houston’s fantastic newcontemporary women’s fiction novel, Little Acorns, and Sam Carrington’s second,Bad Sister – to name just a few…   Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped you get to where you are today?I guess my 15 or so years as an editor, 13 of themcommissioning fiction at Headline, is by far the main one for my current roleas an agent.  But, further back, I did doan English Literature and Language degree at a university that allowed me to comeup with my own theories about texts which, though probably puerile, were my ownand encouraged me to think independently about literature and have theconfidence to assess novels.  I alsoworked as a travel guide in Europe, which again gave me confidence andindependence.  We had a family friend,when I was growing up in Bradford, who was the local librarian and gave myparents boxfuls of used book proofs every month or so. I loved the excitement of thosecardboard boxes – a huge and random selection – and still have some of them,including, for example, Norman Lewis’s Naples, 1944. I’ve always seen books asa way into the world, and have been fascinated by how they are sold and packaged – I‘packaged’ my Latin translation book, full of our class’s O’level translationsof Virgil and Catullus, covered it in tin foil and called it Words of Silver,writing a fake blurb and reviews on the back. I also used to give books I’dread grades in the back of my teenage diary. Animal Farm – A-… You could say Ifound my way to my dream job as an editor and agent.How do you relax after a busy working day?During the week, I watch TV with my husband – I’m a late andzealous convert to Game of Thrones which my son and husband loved from thestart, whilst I was sceptical. I think I like it more than them now. Qualitycrime series – I’m loving the wacky, funny, moving Top of the Lake 2 at themoment. Then a bit of reading in bed.What was the last book you read for pleasure?I always have a non-fiction and a fiction book on the go atonce. If I’ve been working all day on fiction, I can’t read fiction before I goto sleep. The last non-fiction was Kathryn Hughes’s incredibly readableVictorians Undone (she’s not the Kathryn Hughes I represent) which I loved – afascinating chapter at the end about a gruesome crime, the killing of sweetFanny Adams, might be of interest to historical crime enthusiasts. The lastfiction I read was A Rising Man by Abir Mukerjee, which I thought was a reallyimpressive first novel – I admired the way his characters evolved throughoutthe novel and weren’t at all static. I’m going to India for the first time in theautumn and am reading up about it!Describe your job in 15 words or less...Selecting, editing, angling and selling fiction and naturewriting; looking after my authors’ interests. What have been the highlights of your publishing life so farGetting an author to be a number one paperback fictionbestseller.

{"title": "Yesterday by Felicia Yap", "date": "Wednesday 6 September 2017", "text": "YesterdayBy Felicia YapPublished by Wildfire Books (10 August 2017)Publisher's descriptionThere are two types of people in the world: those who canonly remember yesterday, and those who can also recall the day before.You have just one lifeline to the past: your diary. Eachnight, you write down the things that matter. Each morning, your diary tellsyou where you were, who you loved and what you did.Today, the police are at your door. They say that the body ofyour husband's mistress has been found in the River Cam. They think yourhusband killed her two days ago.Can you trust the police? Can you trust your husband? Can you trust yourself?My verdictYesterday is very different from the norm. It's a traditional murder mystery that's set in a dystopian society - a cross between fantasy and crime. A debut thriller that's sure to do well this summer and beyond.In Yesterday, society is split into two tiers - monos and duos - based on their memory capacity (one day or two) as they grow up. Monos are deemed as inferior to duos and given more lowly jobs, yet many strive to improve their status. Everyone has to make sure their digital diaries are as in-depth as possible to 'remember' past events. Some memories can be learned and memorised as fact. The reliance on technology means it's easy to manipulate the past, creating 'false' memories and therefore 'false' facts. Not easy, then, if you're trying to investigate a murder.The plot focuses on a rare mixed marriage, between duo Mark and mono Claire. When a woman is found dead, she has links to Mark. Can Claire trust her husband? On reading her own diary, can she even trust herself? And will Hans, the police officer investigating the crime, discover the truth?The dystopian society isn't that dissimilar from our own, filled with prejudice, infidelity, secrets and lies. It's more a parallel society than an alternative one, with some clever references to companies and industry figures that we're all familiar with. I found this fascinating and would love to know more about how the society worked, in terms of structure and jobs and building personal and professional relationships.Yesterday is a fascinating exploration into memory - how it shapes us, defines us and directs us - and also into social divide. The complex plot is an intriguing murder investigation, based mainly on diary entries and with several twists. The story alternates between four characters' points of view. I didn't particularly like any of the characters (Hans, the detective, was the most likeable for me), but then it's not easy to get to know them that well due to their limited memory spans. They can't really get to know each other that well either, which creates the tension and unease.What made this book so different for me is the concept of investigating a murder when no one can remember much of the past. It's a perfect thriller for the big screen, with its high concept core and focus on technology. I reckon, like many of the bestselling psychological thrillers (Girl On A Train, Gone Girl, Before I Go To Sleep, to name just three), it will create much discussion among readers in years to come.I received an Advanced Reader Copy from the publisher."},

My conclusion on reaching the end of this book was that Colette McBeth is a plotting & writing genius.The book has a multilayered complex plot that had me gripped all the way through. I thought it was going one way, and then there was a major change of direction, increasing the suspense, tension and intrigue. The great writing and fast-paced plot are as concise as you can get, with no unnecessary facts or superfluous words. I loved how all of the threads wound round each other, twisting one way, then another, teasing the reader, and then finally welded together by the end to create a satisfying conclusion.Using multiple viewpoints, Colette McBeth has created a whole host of believable characters, putting you right into their heads with her well-written dialogue and narrative. This is an intelligent psychological thriller and a rollercoaster read.Highly recommended!"},

AUTHORSWhen it comes tocrime I would have to say Jim Thompson. Even if he was little-recognized in hislifetime, his literary heritage lives on. He wrote about 30 novels and a numberof his books became movies after his death. Only two books have been translatedinto Swedish, but I’m pushing for more to come every chance I get. I’m quiteinto a few writers whose work borders the crime genre as well, like CormacMcCarthy, or Hubert Selby Jr. ... FILMS/MOVIES”Lonelinesshas followed me my whole life, everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores,everywhere. There is no escape. I’m God’s lonely man.” Again, even if it’s not crime per se I would saythat Taxi Driver has a noir feel to it so I’m gonna go for that one. ... TV DRAMASArsène Lupin. A more modern one: The Wire. An even moremodern one: Fargo.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSGonna go with JimThompson again here: Lou Ford, a small town sheriff and a complete sociopath inThe Killer Inside Me. Casey Affleck did agood job in the movie based on the book as well. I must say he is one of myfavorite actors. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Mickey Spillane’sMike Hammer without question. My parents taught literature (and so do I) and myfavorite play when I was about seven or eight was Hamlet. Secretly Iread a lot of pulp fiction after bedtime though. ... MURDER WEAPONSI tend to like aproper good old beating.     ... DEATH SCENESI kind of likeone of my own which happened to be one of the first scenes I wrote for my firstnovel Clinch. A man gets stabbed in the throat with a meat thermometer:it ticks up, and ticks down.   ... WRITING TIPSRead theclassics. If you want to write good dialogue have a look at Hemingway’s shortstories or Moby Dick. There is no writing class that can teach you thatstuff.  ... WRITING SNACKSIt used to beanything with alcohol in it but I’m trying to cut down so it’s coffee andprotein bars if anything at all.

Some serious questions, and some just for fun!Today I'm delighted to welcome JULIA SILKLiteraryAgent(in association with MBA Literary and Script Agents)What and when was your first job in publishing?As an production editor on medical journals at Chapman & Hall. I had no medical backgroundat all but I learned a lot and got very good at diagnosing the patients on Casualty and ER before the characters themselves did!How long have you been working in your current job/role?I’ve been an agent for 14 months, working in associationwith MBA Literary and Script Agents.Which books have you worked on recently/are you working on?The books I’ve sold in my first year include a pregnancybook that will empower women to advocate for their rights in pregnancy and childbirth;a brilliant dual-timeline reimagining of Wuthering Heights; and the first twotitles in a heartwarming new women’s commercial fiction series by an author I’dbeen watching for ages and who became my first client when I made the move frompublishing to agenting. I also have a client who’s writing a thriller that I’mreally excited about – we’re describing it as Apple Tree Yard meets TheNight Manager. She’ll be delivering her first full draft in September and Ican’t wait to read the whole thing!  AndI have two completely amazing literary fiction titles out on submission at themoment, about which editors are so far saying lovely things, so fingers crossed.Which qualifications/life skills/experience have helped youget to where you are today?Mostly perseverance. Also learning to just go ahead and dostuff, rather than asking permission; learning to exceed my remit, to take theinitiative. I’ve worked in lots of different areas of publishing – bookselling,production, editorial – as a result of which I can usually see situations fromall sides, and I really enjoying finding solutions to the kind of problems thatoften arise from people not seeing things from all sides! And I’m verysociable, which is pretty crucial in this business, and equally interested inthe detail and big picture.How do you relax after a busy working day?Ah yes, relaxing, I remember it well. I have two small(ish) childrenand by the time the oldest is in bed I don’t have a huge amount of eveningleft. I’m often catching up on work reading as I’m always behind on submissionsbut I’m also addicted to Netflix, and will often stay up too late watching mylatest fixation – this week I’ve been mainlining season one of Top of the Lakeso I can catch up with season two on iPlayer next week.What was the last book you read for pleasure?I’ve just been reading Lucy Caldwell’s linked short stories,Multitudes, and I’m recommending itto everyone – it exposes so much we prefer to keep hidden about ourselves. Itfeels almost as if she’s in your head – quite painful but also compulsivelyreadable. Also, I finally read Renée Knight’s Disclaimer, which I thought was so clever and multi-layered, andthe way she constructed the ending was masterful; a lesser author would haveleft off earlier, but she just kept building and building to it. It pleased megreatly. Non-work reading is just as important as reading submissions andclient work – your judgement is compromised if you don’t have context.Describe your job in 15 words or less...Reader, editor, business manager,hand-holder, catalyst.What have been the highlights of your publishing life sofar?One highlight was launching Orion’s digital crime imprintThe Murder Room – it folded after three years or so, but I learnt SO much inboth practical terms and about myself. But the best thing for me was probablymaking my first sale as an agent in a six-way auction to Penguin; I alwaysfinish that story ‘and then I woke up’.If you could try out any other job for one day (with nolimits on money, travel etc.), what would you choose?Dressmaker. I love the magic of a well-cut garment, how itcan change the way you feel, transform your whole day. Imagine having the skillto do that for people.If your publishing life was a book, what would the title be?It would be called TryAgain. Fail Again. Fail Better. Publishing people love to quote SamuelBeckett’s famous line, because this industry is as much about failure andrejection as it is about success – and each enhances the other.Thanks so much for taking part, Julia!Look out for more MY PUBLISHING LIFE features coming soon.If any literary agents, publishers, publicists or editors would like to take part, contact me through my blog or Twitter for the full list of questions."},
{"title": "Glass Houses by Louise Penny - Blog Tour", "date": "Thursday 31 August 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for Glass Houses by Louise Penny. Glass Houses was published by Sphere on 29 August 2017.Glass HousesBy Louise PennyPublished by Sphere (29 August 2017)Publisher's descriptionOne cold November day, a mysterious figureappears on the village green in Three Pines, causing unease, alarm and confusionamong everyone who sees it. Chief Superintendent, Armand Gamache knowssomething is seriously wrong, but all he can do is watch and wait, hoping hisworst fears are not realised. But when the figure disappears and a dead body isdiscovered, it falls to Gamache to investigate.In the early days of the murder inquiry, andmonths later, as the trial for the accused begins, Gamache must face theconsequences of his decisions, and his actions, from which there is no goingback . . .My verdictI haven't read a Louise Penny book before (dare I admit it), so wasn't sure what to expect, especially as this is number 13 in the Chief Inspector Gamache series. But I'm so glad that I picked this one up. It's easy to read as a standalone, although obviously I'm missing the back story of all of the main characters and will need to start at the beginning of the series to satisfy my inquisitive self.Glass Houses is part courtroom drama (think John Grisham) and part murder mystery (think Agatha Christie). Set in a small fairly isolated village called Three Pines, this is a highly chilling book, involving the appearance of a mysterious figure who appears to be watching someone in the village? And then there's a murder. Who's the victim? Who's on trial? And why?Glass Houses is a complex multi-layered plot with multi-character viewpoints and different timelines. The writing is brilliant and the story itself is gripping all the way through. It didn't matter that I hadn't been introduced to Gamache before.I highly recommend Glass Houses as a standalone crime fiction novel, even though it's part of a series. This isn't just a simple 'whodunnit'. The varied but small cast of characters and atmospheric descriptions really made this literary crime fiction novel stand out from the crowd for me.On a side note, as I was about to read this book I received an email from a distant cousin who lives in St Louis, Missouri, USA. I hadn't heard from her for a while. She said she had noticed I review crime fiction on my blog. Had I read any Louise Penny books as she's a huge fan? Life is full of coincidences.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Nadia Dalbuono ", "date": "Wednesday 30 August 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome NADIA DALBUONOto share her BEST OF CRIME ...  ... AUTHORSIt would no doubt be more interesting to name some obscure,hitherto overlooked crime writer from a remote island no-one has heard of butI'm afraid my choice has to be Michael Connelly. As far as I'm concerned, he'sthe master. From plot to pacing to characterisation, he never puts a footwrong. Apart from creating such strong and compelling characters in Haller andBosch, I'm still fascinated by the backdrop of LA and the vastly differentexistences jostling for survival there. ... FILMS/MOVIES The Insider by Michael Mann would easily be my first choice.Mann is a superb director and apart from his extraordinary eye for composition,this powerful true story was absorbing in its ability to elicit a range ofdifferent emotions, anger being foremost among them. Mann managed to wrestleone of the best ever performances from Russell Crowe as conflicted tobaccoindustry whistleblower, Jeffrey Wigan - it was an unsanitized, provocativeportrayal and at times painful to watch. ... TV DRAMASI would contend that the opening scene from the firstepisode of TV series Billions is one of the cleverest openings in the historyof TV pilots! And it just gets better from there on in. Billions is amasterclass in direction, editing and scriptwriting and the silent dance of predatorand prey between US Attorney Chuck Rhoades and hedge fund king Bobby Axelrod isfascinating to watch. There is one particular scene where Axelrod stages a fakeargument to distance himself from potential insider dealing charges that Ibelieve is one of the funniest/exciting/bizarre two minutes of drama ever made.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI couldn't ever say I like him but I've always beenimpressed by Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. The way he leaps sowholeheartedly into despicability with no instinct for self preservation; theway he tries to rouse his fellow 80s zombies from their brainwashed existence;the way he tries to come clean to his lawyer but to no avail. I guess I'vealways felt sorry for him: he never finds catharsis. All that effort andcreativity in his killing but at the end he's condemned to return to the samesuffocating existence of materialism, narcissism and greed. American Psychoseems to start out as a comedy of manners with Bateman taking a similar role toElizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice but then he descends into hell andwinds up like Dante in the Inferno - yet with no Virgil to guide him. That'sbeen Bateman's problem from the start: he's totally alone and nobody wants tolisten.Obviously, all this depends on your reading of the book. Asunreliable narrator supreme, Bateman may have made the whole thing up and neverhad the courage to carry out such daring murders... ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES It has to be Harry Bosch. Bosch appeals on so many levels:his terrible childhood, his troubled love life, his continued conflict withauthority and strong sense of right and wrong, often at the expense of his owncareer. I feel as if he's become a friend - the unstinting effort he puts intohis relationship with his teenage daughter and his relentless pursuit of thetruth makes him very real. I think we're about 21 books in now and he stillholds my interest. ... MURDER WEAPONSI quite liked when Patrick Bateman dropped a chainsaw onChristie from several floors above and I'm sure there are scenes from some DeanKoontz novels which I no longer recall but I think the prize has to go toHannibal Lecter for his sixth victim who is savagely murdered in his workshopusing an array of different tools. (I seem to remember that he is then laced toa pegboard in a manner reminiscent of illustrations in early medical textbooks.)     ... DEATH SCENESI've read a lot of Lee Child but I have to say the ending toMake Me really freaked me out. I was actually quite angry with Lee because Ifelt like he'd departed from his usual, more palatable mainstream territory anddragged me unawares into the nightmare niche of the dark web: a place I reallywasn't prepared to visit just yet.Spoiler alert! Why is the end so disturbing? Maybe not somuch for the torture as for the callousness, the pure evil of the conceptbehind it and the fact that so much is left to our imagination. Despite orperhaps due to the deeply chilling finale, Make Me is a great book. The qualityof the writing is superb - I think it's his best yet.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI read Corriera Della Sera frequently for Italian news:there's always a strange little story in there involving organised crime orlocal politicians that might provide the kernel for a new idea. I also take mybreaks from writing by reading Trump's stream of consciousness on Twitter.Twitter is a great way to plumb the depths of the human condition. ... WRITING TIPSIf it's not convincing you, it won't convince anyone else.I've hoodwinked myself on numerous conditions only to regret it later. Also:plan, plan, plan. For my first two books I wrote detailed synopses, for thenext two I slackened off a bit and paid the price while I was writing - it feltso much harder. I've now returned to having a detailed scheme to work from. ... WRITING SNACKSJust these two words ‘Writing snacks’ cause me considerableanxiety. When I was pregnant with my second child and writing my second novel,The American, I was hit by extreme tiredness and used to polish off a 100g barof Lindt milk chocolate by midday just to keep going. The situation got worseand worse and 6 months into my pregnancy I developed gestational diabetes. (Nofun, believe me - oatcakes just didn't give me the same buzz.) I now am 7 timesmore likely to contract diabetes and have to watch my sugar intake. As aresult, I no longer snack when I'm writing: a lesson in the pitfalls of poorself-control. About NADIA DALBUONONadia Dalbuono worked as a documentary director and producerfor Channel 4, ITV and Fox before turning to crime writing.

He may be one of the last honest men in Italy. But when Scamarcio is handed a file of extremely compromising photographs of a high-profile Italian politician, and told to ‘deal with it’, he knows he’s in for trouble. And when a young man is found stabbed to death in Rome, and a young American girl disappears on a beach in Elba, Scamarcio’s job gets a whole lot more complicated. Worst of all, every lead seems to implicate the prime minister ― a multi-media baron, and the most powerful man in Italy. As the case spins out of control, and his own past catches up with him, Scamarcio must navigate the darkest currents of Italian society ― only to find that nothing is as it seems, and that the price of truth may be higher than he can pay. The Hit was published by Scribe on 9 February 2017.Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},
{"title": "House of Spines by Michael J Malone", "date": "Tuesday 29 August 2017", "text": "House of SpinesBy Michael J MalonePublished by Orenda Books (e-book: 16 August 2017; paperback: 15 September 2017)Publisher's descriptionRan McGhie's world has beenturned upside down. A young, lonely and frustrated writer, and suffering frommental-health problems, he discovers that his long-dead mother was related toone of Glasgow's oldest merchant families. Not only that, but Ran has inheritedNewton Hall, a vast mansion that belonged to his great-uncle, who it seems hasbeen watching from afar as his estranged great-nephew has grown up. Enteringhis new-found home, it seems Great-Uncle Fitzpatrick has turned it into atemple to the written word - the perfect place for poet Ran. But everything isnot as it seems. As he explores the Hall's endless corridors, Ran's grasp onreality appears to be loosening. And then he comes across an ancient lift; andin that lift a mirror. And in the mirror... the reflection of a woman... My verdictHouse of Spines is a gothic tale of love, lust, loneliness and lies.When struggling writer Ran McGhie learns he has inherited Newton Hall, he jumps at the opportunity to move in straight away. The vast mansion belonged to Ran's great uncle, someone he not only never met but never even knew existed. Ran knows very little about his parents, who died when he was 18.With its huge library, Newton Hall is an ideal place for a poet. His great uncle's will stipulates that if Ran chooses to live in the house, the books there must never be moved. Sounds simple enough, doesn't it? But Ran, who suffers from bipolar disorder, seems overwhelmed by his new living arrangements, with its endless array of rooms and corridors, gardens and swimming pool and an ancient lift. He has strange visions, feels a woman's touch, hears her voice - but is everything all it seems or is his grasp on reality swinging out of control?Michael J Malone is a very vivid writer, putting the reader right into the head, and heart, of his protagonist. In House of Spines, I felt like I was living the story with Ran - seeing what he saw, feeling what he felt. The pictures the author paints within his prose, of the smells, sounds and sights of old Newton Hall, are as chilling and disturbing as the story itself.The plot builds up gradually, immersing the reader in Ran's daily life as he explores his surroundings and meets some of the locals. It's creepy and unsettling, with a unreliable protagonist - in fact a whole host of unreliable characters. I worked out some things, but not everything, and there were plenty of surprises to come.For me, this was less of a 'psychological thriller' than a great gothic mystery of a man's descent into mania and a family steeped in secrets and lies.Highly recommended if you like creepy spine-tingling twisty tales.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome SIMON LELICto share his BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSTough one.I could name dozens. But when TanaFrench publishes a new novel, it always leapfrogs to the top of my readingpile. I’ve been a fan of her writing since her first novel, In the Woods, and since then she’s gonefrom strength to strength. I love the way each of her books inhabits the sameworld, but she never limits herself to experiencing it through oneprotagonist’s point of view. ... FILMS/MOVIESAnything directedby Alfred Hitchcock. Literally, anything.If I stumble across a Hitchcock movie showing on TV, I stop what I’m doing andI watch it, even if I’ve seen it twenty times before (which, with some of hismovies, I surely have). Rope for meremains his most under-appreciated masterpiece, but I adore Rear Window, too. ... TV DRAMASThe Shield, a cop drama set in the fictionalLA district of Farmington, is myall-time favourite when it comes to crime dramas. I’ve watched it from start tofinish three times now.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSAnton Chigurh is surely one of the most terrifyingantagonists ever written. He’s the killer in Cormac McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men, and he shows nocompassion, no remorse – just an alarming dexterity with a bolt gun. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I tend notto read crime series featuring the same detective very often. I much prefer toread (and write, not coincidentally!) standalone novels. One notable exception,however, is the Shardlake series byCJ Sansom. Matthew Shardlake is the hunchbacked lawyer who has to navigate thepolitics and pitfalls of sixteenth-century London, and he’s brilliantlyperceptive, vulnerable and humane. ... MURDER WEAPONSThe rat in AmericanPsycho. I don’t think I need to say more.     ... DEATH SCENESGoing backto NoCountry for Old Men, and avoiding any major spoilers, there is a deathof a fairly central character (a deliberately vague understatement) thathappens between chapters. Ie, the character is there on one page, gone thenext. It remains one of the most surprising deaths in literature, for my money– cruelly depriving the reader in a way that perfectly mimics death itself.... BLOGS/WEBSITESThe Paris Review website featuresa vast vault of author interviews dating back to the 1950s. There’s a wealth ofknowledge in there – invaluable to any reader or writer. It used to be free toaccess, but now you have to subscribe. Still, it’s well worth doing so, Ireckon. ... WRITING TIPSBe careful which writing tips you follow.

{"title": "At First Light by Vanessa Lafaye", "date": "Saturday 26 August 2017", "text": "At First LightBy Vanessa LafayePublished by Orion (1 June 2017)Publisher's description1993, Key West, Florida. When a Ku Klux Klan official isshot in broad daylight, all eyes turn to the person holding the gun: a96-year-old Cuban woman who will say nothing except to admit her guilt.1919. Mixed-race Alicia Cortez arrives in Key West exiled indisgrace from her family in Havana. At the same time, damaged war hero JohnMorales returns home on the last US troop ship from Europe. As love draws themcloser in this time of racial segregation, people are watching, includingDwayne Campbell, poised on the brink of manhood and struggling to do what'sright. And then the Ku Klux Klan comes to town...My verdictAt First Light is historical fiction with crime at the heart of it. Not just murder, but also bigotry, racism and violence. This novel is very much a book of modern times, even though most of the story is set in 1919. For me, the saddest realisation on reading it was that many things still haven't changed, almost 100 years on.This is the story of Alicia Cortez, a 96-year-old Cuban woman who admits to shooting a Ku Klux Klan official in Key West, Florida. Alicia arrived in Key West from Havana, exiled by her family, and found love at a time of racial segregation, just as the Ku Klux Klan came to town. Vanessa Lafaye has set this love story during a fascinating period of history. Thanks to her flowing writing and vivid descriptions, I found myself totally immersed into Key West's daily life.I loved Vanessa Lafaye's first book, Summertime, and never expected to love At First Light even more. Yet I did. I cried my way through the final chapters and shared for my love for it on Twitter soon after I finished. It is stunning from beginning to end, with so many diverse believable, real characters. The book is inspired by real events and real people. There's a Pinterest board (the link is at the back of the book), which really brings the story and characters to life after you've finished reading.I was offered an ARC of At First Light to review on my blog, but I turned it down, not because I didn't want to read it, but because I didn't know when I'd read it. I was reluctant to say yes, as I have such as huge TBR pile. But when I saw the book in Waterstones soon after publication, I knew I had to buy it, read it and review it as soon as I could.I'm so glad I did.I'll be recommending this book to everyone, not just now but for years to come."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Lynda La Plante", "date": "Friday 25 August 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome LYNDA LA PLANTEto share her BEST OF CRIME ... ... AUTHORSI am anavid fan of Michael Connolly. His knowledge of police procedure and intricateplots keeps the reader enthralled, but he also brings to life very strongcharacters that drive the narrative. It is no wonder that many of his novelshave been adapted for film and television series. ... FILMS/MOVIESI was astudent at RADA and used to go to a small cinema showing foreign films with subtitles in Hampstead. I have never forgotten watching Anthony Quinn andGiulietta Masino in the stunning film La Strada directed by Frederico Fellini.The characters are emotionally compelling and the simplicity of the storylineis made powerful by the brilliant performances of the stars. I now have it onDVD and still watch it every year and it never ceases to touch me; it is a veryhaunting film.... TV DRAMASI loved theCROWN as I think it is the best drama we have made in the UK for many years. Itis exquisite to watch. I love everything about it.... FICTIONAL KILLERSI thinkHannibal Lecter has to be one of the best fictional killers ever written. SirAnthony Hopkins portrayal of the character in the movie made him even more of aterrifying character. I was in the same year as Anthony at RADA and he is abrilliant actor. Nobody else could play Lecter like him. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES I loveanything written by Raymond Chandler. His Philip Marlow was a fore runner forall the detectives and his creation was yet another fictional detective thatmade it to the big screen. Chandler's writing has great humour and his abilityin a few strokes to describe characters that leap off the page and drive hisplots is for me the biggest incentive to encourage writers to read his works. ... MURDER WEAPONSKnives and guns are obvious murder weapons but they leave behind a trail of evidence forthe police to track down and make an arrest. Poison has become a veryfrightening silent weapon of death. Numerous victims have died from being givendoses of anti-freeze to such an extent the manufacturers were forced to add adistinct smell and colour. Strychnine also retains a strong odour of almonds. Rat poison likewise, but someone intent on killing can gain from the internet afrightening array of toxic poisons that are difficult to trace.    ... DEATH SCENESI recentlyread the brilliant Patricia Cornwell’s book tracing the Jack the Ripper crimes.Her research and narrative is very compelling as she uncovers the identity ofthe infamous killer. We also had the repellent Yorkshire Ripper, who inmany ways mirrored the Victorian murderer and attempted to replicate hisgruesome disemboweling of his victims, making his capture a relief. However, theoriginal mad man was never caught and Miss Cornwall creates such compassion andempathy for the tragic victims that their death scenes are still able toinstill great sadness at the brutal way their lives were taken. There is neverany pleasure in a death scene, nor is there any humour in dying. However I wasvery amused when I read about the 1920’s high society Emerald Cunard asking hermaid for a glass of champagne on her death bed. When the maid brought her thechilled champagne in an elegant fluted glass she said ‘It is for you’. About LYNDA LA PLANTELynda La Plante was born inLiverpool.

{"title": "The Hit by Nadia Dalbuono", "date": "Tuesday 22 August 2017", "text": "The HitBy Nadia DalbuonoPublished by Scribe (9 February 2017)Publisher's description Detective Leone Scamarcio, the son of a former leading mafioso, has turned his back on thefamily business, and has joined the Rome police force. He may be one of thelast honest men in Italy. But when Scamarcio is handed a file of extremelycompromising photographs of a high-profile Italian politician, and told to‘deal with it’, he knows he’s in for trouble. And when a young man is foundstabbed to death in Rome, and a young American girl disappears on a beach in Elba,Scamarcio’s job gets a whole lot more complicated. Worst of all, every lead seems to implicate the primeminister ― a multi-media baron, and the most powerful man in Italy. As the casespins out of control, and his own past catches up with him, Scamarcio mustnavigate the darkest currents of Italian society ― only to find that nothing isas it seems, and that the price of truth may be higher than he can pay. My verdictThe Hit is the third in the Leona Scamarcio detective series, which is set in Rome. This is a new series for me, and what better place to read the book than in stunning Rome itself. I took The Hit away with me on my six-day summer break last month.I enjoy reading police procedurals, but even more so when they're set in another country, as you learn so much about the culture there through the eyes of the locals. This twisty police procedural contains enough description to give the reader a great sense of place, but not too much to slow down the plot. This was an enjoyable gripping read, filled with tension and humour and a lead detective with murky family roots.The book can easily be read as a standalone, although I'm now intrigued enough to buy the first two books to catch up on Scamarcio's family background. I also loved the insight into Italian culture, organised crime and police corruption.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher."},

AUTHORSI’ve lovedboth of Liz Nugent’s books because they’re so fresh and different. Belinda Bauer’soriginality makes her stand out in the crowded terrain of psychologicalthrillers. I’ve always loved Lisa Jewell’s writing, but her more recent ventureinto psychological suspense has given her books a darker edge, but still withher trademark focus on totally rounded, utterly believable characters, which isan unbeatable combination. Recently I’ve loved The Dry by Jane Harper, set inthe parched outback in Australia. You can feel the relentless heat coming offthe page. ... FILMS/MOVIESStrangerson a Train is still the ultimate crime movie for me. The central concept of thePatricia Highsmith novel on which it is based – two random strangers swapmurders - is so neat and perfectly self-contained. And the character of BrunoAnthony is such a brilliant psychological study. Oh, and all the most crucialaction takes place in an amusement park, ending in an out-of-control carouselride. Who could resist? ... TV DRAMASLikemillions of others, our household was hooked on the first two series of Narcoswhere two DEA officers try to bring Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar tojustice. It’s the combination of a powerhouse central performance from WagnerMoura which shows the violence and cruelty of Escobar, who went from nothing tobeing one of the richest men in the world, and at the same time hisvulnerability. But also the psychological interplay between the DEA agents andtheir quarry, and between Escobar and his various key henchmen. And all setagainst the breathtaking backdrop of Colombia itself.... FICTIONAL KILLERSAs soon asI read Caroline Kepnes’ brilliant psychological thriller ‘You’, I fell a littlebit in love with Joe Goldberg, a charming, witty, razor-smart New Yorkbookseller, who just happens to be a stalker. And a psychopath. But somehowthat doesn’t stop the reader from secretly willing him on. Genius.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES CommandantCamille Verhoeven, the invention of French crime writer Pierre Lemaitre is abrilliant creation. At just four foot eleven (due to his mother’s heavy smokingduring pregnancy), what he lacks in height he makes up for in intellect anddetermination and old-fashioned nobility. His own tragic past, which involvedthe murder of his beloved wife, has made him more intuitive to evil, but alsoto love.... MURDER WEAPONSI’m such a totalwuss, I can’t read or watch very graphic violence.

BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m a bigbeliever in the old adage ‘the truth is stranger than fiction’ and when I’m ata loose end for plot ideas, I’ll invariably end up googling ‘weirdest real lifecrimes’ or some variant thereof and then spending the rest of the day lost downthe wormhole of bizarre human behavior. Although all too often I’ll getenthused about an idea before ruling it out on the basis that if I tried to putit in a novel, readers would claim it was too far-fetched.... WRITING TIPSDon’t showyour first draft to anyone – unless you want to find yourself pulled in amyriad of conflicting directions.If yourinterest is flagging, chances are your readers’ will be too. Think about themost shocking thing that might happen at this point. And then write it. Youmight not end up keeping it in, but at least it might have re-energised you.Accept thatsome people won’t like what you write. That’s fine. Most of my favourite bookshave a low to average rating on Amazon. That’s because the writer hasn’t playedsafe. Which, conversely, is why those are my favourite books! ... WRITING SNACKSI drink alot of coffee and green tea (not together, that would be weird), so the idealwriting snack has to be one that is eminently dunkable.

{"title": "The Collector by Fiona Cummins - VERY EARLY REVIEW", "date": "Sunday 20 August 2017", "text": "I don't usually do such early reviews. So apologies. This isn't out until 2018 but I couldn't wait to read it. Now I've read it, I couldn't wait to review it. If you haven't read Rattle, Fiona Cummins' first book, I suggest you buy it now (out in paperback on 24th August). Then the wait for The Collector won't seem quite so long.The CollectorBy Fiona CumminsPublished by Pan MacmillanPublisher's descriptionJakey escaped with his life and moved to a new town.His rescue was a miracle but his parents know that the Collector is still outthere, watching, waiting...Clara, the girl he left behind, is clinging to the hopethat someone will come and save her.Life has fallen apart for Clara’s mother as she starts to lose hope.The Bone Collector has a new apprentice to take over hisfamily’s legacy. Buthe can’t forget the boy who got away and the detective who had destroyed hisdreamsDetective Etta Fitzroy’s life collapsed when the Collectorescaped. With Clara still missing,and a new wave of uncannily similar murders beginning, will she be able to findhim again?The Collector is back and this time he has nothing to lose. . .My verdictFiona Cummins is one of the most talented crime writers I've stumbled upon in recent years. Not only is she a plotting genius, but her writing is sublime. I loved Rattle - an outstanding crime thriller - and couldn't wait to read The Collector. Well, not only has Fiona done it again but she's totally surpassed herself.The Collector is harrowing, gruesome, chilling, terrifying, horrific, gripping, compelling... I could go on. This is a very dark plot, and descriptions may turn your stomach, get right under your skin and (dare I write this) rattle your bones. BUT the horror is dabbled with moments of tenderness and hope, with characters to believe in and invest in. This is a return to old characters and an introduction to new ones. Could this be read as a standalone? Probably. Yet why do so, when you can read Rattle too?The plot moves at a cracking pace, with short concise chapters - I barely took a breath all the way through. This is a book that's hard to put down once you've started reading. It tackles all of your senses in one go, with such powerful writing in every word, every sentence, every paragraph, every page...Fiona Cummins' books are perfect for fans of top authors Mo Hader and Thomas Harris. I suspect in years to come, though, that Rattle, The Collector and many more of Fiona's books themselves will be on the lists of crime fiction masterclasses to study pace, tension and creepiness.The Collector is, without doubt, going to be a top recommendation of mine for 2018, just as Rattle has been this year. I can't wait to see what Fiona Cummins writes next - unfortunately, I suspect I'll have to wait a while, considering this book isn't out for several months.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Here's the link to my review of Rattle: http://off-the-shelfbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/rattle-by-fiona-cummins.html"},
{"title": "The Last Resort by Steph Broadribb", "date": "Thursday 17 August 2017", "text": "The Last Resort: A Lori Anderson Short Story (Rookie Bounty Hunter)By Steph BroadribbPublished by Orenda Books (1 August 2017)Publisher's descriptionDone with a life ofexploitation and violence, Lori Anderson is training to be a bounty hunter.Holed up in the Georgia Mountains with her reclusive mentor, JT, Lori isdetermined to put her new skills into practice. Behind JT's back, she breakshis rules and grabs the chance she's looking for. Will her gamble pay off, orwill she have to learn the hard way? My verdictIf you're a Lori Anderson fan, you're in for a treat with The Last Resort. You're also in for a treat if you haven't yet read Steph's Broadribb's Deep Down Dead, the first novel in her Lori Anderson series. This was the best action thriller I had read in a long time and it's sure to be in my top reads this year.I'm not going to give anything away about the plot (other than the blurb above), because it is a short story. But The Last Resort is a fun quick read (with a rookie female bounty hunter with attitude and a sexy bounty hunter pro) while you're waiting for the next Lori Anderson book, Deep Blue Trouble, which is being published by Orenda Books in January 2018. We get a snippet of Lori's life while she was training with bounty hunter JT, well before their story in Deep Down Dead.The Last Resort is also a great introduction to Steph Broadribb's Lori Anderson series, as you get the added bonus of the first three chapters of Deep Down Dead at the end - and they're certain to leave you wanting more. They left me wanting more, and this is my third time reading them, having read Deep Down Dead twice (yes, I am a 'bit' of a fan).If you're a fan of Janet Evanovitch and Lee Child, buy this short story and buy Deep Down Dead! Oh, and pre-order Deep Blue Trouble too!Fierce KingdomBy Gin PhillipsPublished by Transworld (15 June 2017)Publisher's descriptionLincoln is a good boy. At theage of four, he is curious, clever and well behaved. He does as his mum saysand knows what the rules are.'The rules are different today. The rules are that we hide and do not letthe man with the gun find us.'When an ordinary day at the zoo turns into anightmare, Joan finds herself trapped with her beloved son. She must summon allher strength, find unexpected courage and protect Lincoln at all costs – evenif it means crossing the line between right and wrong; between humanity andanimal instinct.It's a line none of us would ever normally dreamof crossing.But sometimes the rules are different.My verdictFierce Kingdom was a powerful, intriguing and emotive story, with a chilling opening chapter, although it wasn't all as fast paced as I expected. It explores the behaviour of a mother and her young son during an emergency situation, rather than reading like an action-packed thriller all the way through.The book focuses mainly on Joan and four-year-old Lincoln, who are caught up in a shooting incident at their local zoo. This is a place they know well, so Joan knows exactly where to hide when the shooting begins. The focus is on their relationship and the difficult decisions Joan has to make to keep them safe.Fierce Kingdom is beautifully written, with vivid descriptions of the zoo, although this did slow down the pace at times. Most chapters follow Joan's thoughts, as she works how to keep Lincoln calm at a time of immense danger. Being a typical young child, he gets bored easily, needs food and struggles to keep quiet. But we do 'meet' another couple of the people in hiding, as well as one of the gunmen.The tension ramped up as the book progressed, once Joan and Lincoln left their hiding place in search of food. The ending was fairly dramatic but also a little abrupt, leaving me to wonder what had happened to some of the other characters. Plus, being set in a zoo, I would have loved more animal involvement.Overall though, this was an enjoyable read and certainly made me think 'what would I have done in that situation?'I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalley."},
{"title": "Maria in the Moon by Louise Beech", "date": "Monday 14 August 2017", "text": "Maria in the MoonBy Louise BeechPublished by Orenda Books (15 August 2017)Publisher's descriptionLong ago my beloved Nanny Evechose my name. Then one day she stopped calling me it. I try now to rememberwhy, but I just can't.' Thirty-two-year-old Catherine Hope has a great memory.But she can't remember everything. She can't remember her ninth year. She can'tremember when her insomnia started. And she can't remember why everyone stoppedcalling her Catherine-Maria. With a promiscuous past, and licking her woundsafter a painful breakup, Catherine wonders why she resists anything approachingreal love. But when she loses her home to the devastating deluge of 2007 andvolunteers at Flood Crisis, a devastating memory emerges ... and changeseverything. Dark, poignant and deeply moving, Maria in the Moon is anexamination of the nature of memory and truth, and the defences we build toprotect ourselves, when we can no longer hide...My verdictMaria in the Moon is yet another stunner from Louise Beech.Set in Hull, just after the floods of 2007, the book focuses on Catherine Hope, who can't remember her ninth year. All she knows is that this was when her father died. She's volunteering at Flood Crisis, helping people resolve their own problems even though she can't deal with her own. She's filled with so many questions. When and why did her family stop using her full name (Catherine-Maria)?  When did her insomnia and other health problems begin? Why does she shy away from real love? Then her childhood memories start coming back.Maria in the Moon features more humour than Louise Beech's other books, yet the underlying story is even darker and more evocative. The writing is simply stunning, so vivid and descriptive that it takes you right into the heart of the story and into the lives of her diverse, larger-than-life and highly realistic characters. I couldn't help but be transported into Hull at a time of crisis.I wanted to read this book slowly, to savour every moment, yet found myself racing ahead, just to see what had happened to Catherine in the past and what was going to happen to her next. The book is filled with surprises - some good, some bad and some that turned me into a total wreck.All of Louise Beech's books are different in subject and plot, yet they evoke the same emotions - or rather, all the emotions. I defy anyone to read her books with at least a tear in their eye, although it's more likely to be a trickle or maybe even a flood. Keep the tissues handy!I received an Advance Reader Copy."},
{"title": "The Marsh King's Daughter by Karen Dionne", "date": "Friday 11 August 2017", "text": "The Marsh King's DaughterBy Karen DionnePublished by Sphere (13 June 2017)Publisher's description'I was born two years into my mother's captivity. She wasthree weeks shy of seventeen. If I had known then what I do now, things wouldhave been a lot different. I would have been a lot more understanding of mymother. I wouldn't haveadored my father.'When the notorious child abductor known as the Marsh Kingescapes from a maximum security prison, Helena immediately suspects that sheand her two young daughters are in danger.No one, not even her husband, knows the truth about Helena'spast: they don't know that she was born into captivity, that she had no contactwith the outside world before the age of twelve - or that her father raised herto be a killer.And they don't know that the Marsh King can survive and huntin the wilderness better than anyone... except, perhaps his own daughter. My verdictI loved The Marsh King's Daughter from the first page. It hooked me in straight away and I couldn't put it down. I read most of it in one sitting - being reluctant to leave the house and socialise until I finished it. I ended up reading it late into the evening, realising I wouldn't sleep until I knew the full story. Not many books recently have had such an impact on me.This is the story of Helena, a girl born in captivity after her father abducted her mother, who was a young teenager at the time. Now Helena is an adult with a family of her own. When her father escapes from prison, Helena suspects he's coming for her - and decides to turn the tables on him, knowing him better than anyone else.This book is certainly a fast-paced read, with beautifully flowing writing. It's very visual too, with chilling descriptions of the marshland setting. I love Helena - she's a fantastic gutsy lead character, a mother determined to do whatever she can to protect her family. As for the underlying plot - wow! This may be a child abduction novel, but it's certainly in a league of its own.The Marsh King's Daughter is totally different from anything else around at present - a breath of fresh air, although it's very very dark and haunting. A book that's difficult to forget. I urge everyone to buy it and read it! I just wish I hadn't left it on my reading pile for quite so long.Highly recommended!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalley."},

{"title": "Author catch up - Mary-Jane Riley", "date": "Wednesday 9 August 2017", "text": "I've had Mary-Jane Riley's two books - The Bad Things and After She Fell - on my Kindle for a very long time (an embarrassingly long time). But I finally managed to read them a few months ago. And I'm so glad I did.Both books feature journalist Alex Devlin, who is investigating crimes and cases that are personal to her. As a journalist, I do have a soft spot for crime fiction featuring journalists although only when they're portrayed realistically, as Mary-Jane Riley has done here.In The Bad Things, Alex is looking into the abduction and murder (15 years earlier) of her sister Sasha's two small children - Harry's body was discovered soon afterwards, but Millie's remains have never been found. When the woman who was jailed as an accessory to murder is released, Alex is determined to discover what really happened all those years ago. She wants her troubled sister to find closure as Sasha still struggles to cope with the aftermath of the past.In After She Fell, Alex is investigating the death of the teenage daughter of an old friend. Seventeen-year-old Elena was found at the bottom of the cliff near her boarding school. In this book, we hear Elena's voice in the form of her diaries, providing a snapshot of her life - the teenager is portrayed realistically.I loved both of these books. Alex is a very believable character. She's warm and sensitive when she needs to be, but also determined and not one to take no for an answer. These books are as much about the characters as the investigations.Both books are filled with family dynamics, secrets and lies. They are well plotted and gripping, with enough tension and pace to keep me intrigued all the way through. Mary-Jane Riley certainly kept me on my toes, with her twists, turns and red herrings. The endings were unexpected, but also neat, leaving no loose threads.You could read After She Fell as a standalone, but it does reveal information about The Bad Things, which could act as a spoiler. It's probably best to read this books in the right order.I look forward to seeing what's next from Mary-Jane Riley.About the booksThe Bad ThingsPublished by Killer Reads (August 2015)Publisher's descriptionAlex Devlin’s life changed forever fifteen years ago when her sister Sasha's two small children were snatched in broad daylight.

{"title": "The Music Shop by Rachel Joyce", "date": "Tuesday 8 August 2017", "text": "The Music ShopBy Rachel JoycePublished by Transworld (13 July 2017)Publisher's description1988. Frank owns a musicshop. It is jam-packed with records of every speed, size and genre. Classical,jazz, punk – as long as it’s vinyl he sells it. Day after day Frank finds hiscustomers the music they need. Then into his life walks Ilse Brauchmann.Ilse asks Frank to teach her about music. Hisinstinct is to turn and run. And yet he is drawn to this strangely still,mysterious woman with her pea-green coat and her eyes as black as vinyl. ButIlse is not what she seems. And Frank has old wounds that threaten to re-openand a past he will never leave behind ... My verdictThe Music Shop is a heartwarming character-driven novel with rhythmic writing, descriptive prose and gentle humour. It's a quirky and nostalgic easy read and should appeal to most people.Set in the late 1980s, it prompted me to reminisce about the music and culture of my teenage years. This was a great time of change, with the housing boom and property development, and within music itself, with the rise of shiny CDs and synthetic pop bands. Yet Frank, the key character in The Music Shop, doesn't like change. Instead, he loves his old vinyls and the other small high street shops. He has a gift for choosing music to suit his customers' needs, yet he ignores his own.The Music Shop has a love story at its heart, but not just between Frank and the mysterious Ilse. It's about loving yourself, your community and the changing world. This is a book about dealing with change, whether it's sticking to your principles or accepting that the world is moving on around you - and that you'll be lost if you don't take the plunge yourself.The ending is a bit 'cheesy' and maybe a little rushed. But overall, this relaxing read provides much food for thought.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher (through Lovereading)."},

The Darkness Within was published by Avon on 13 July 2017.Here's the extract ...(Pages 87 to 90)Jacobgot off the bus and headed for the bank. It felt good being out by himself, incontrol, and away from the rectory and his parents. They were doing his head inand it had to stop.Freedom rules, he thought, for now he’d done it once – reclaimed hisindependence – it would be easy to keep going. He had plans. A car was next. Adecent one. He’d had an old banger that had finally given up on him just beforehe’d become ill. Originally he’d been going to save up for another car but thatwasn’t going to happen with no salary coming in, and he couldn’t wait for ever.He’d been researching new cars online and had found there were some really gooddeals. Decent cars, fast ones that would give him power and status, that didn’tneed much of a deposit. Once he’d met up with Chez and got his stuff, his planwas to go to the showrooms in town. He’d already spoken on the phone to a guycalled Gary there who’d said that if his credit was OK, he could drive a caraway. He felt his heart step up a beat at the thought. A new, flashy fast carwas just what he needed. ‘Shit!’Jacob said aloud, arriving outside the bank. A sign over the cash machine read:Out of order. We apologize for any inconvenience. ‘Shit,’ hesaid again. How long was the queue at the counter? He couldn’t risk being latefor Chez. Inside the bank he was relieved to see that there wasn’t a queue, andone of the cashiers was already free. He went up to the counter and thecashier, blonde and attractive, smiled at him, greeting him with a bright,‘Good afternoon. How can I help you?’, like she was genuinely pleased to seehim. ‘Goodafternoon. My day just got a lot better. Unfortunately, I just want your moneyfor today.’ He held her gaze and saw her blush. He liked that, shy, not confi­dentand overpowering. Eloise had become far too assertive lately and often remindedhim of his mother. She passedhim the PINsentry reader and he inserted his card and entered his PIN. Heslowly slid the card reader back across the counter and didn’t immediatelyremove his hand, so that as she took it her fingers brushed his. He saw herflush again. ‘How wouldyou like your money?’ she asked. ‘Howeveryou’d like to give it to me,’ he said sugges­tively, holding her gaze.The cashiersitting next to her heard and in a loud whisper, intended for him to hear, saidjokingly, ‘You’d better watch that one.’He laughed.‘Twenties will be fine, thank you. Has anyone told you you’ve got a lovely smile?’It sounded cheesy but it worked. ‘Thank-you,’she said shyly. He watchedas she counted out his money. He could tell his gaze was making herself-conscious, unsure of herself.‘Thank youso much,’ he said charmingly, taking the notes she passed him. ‘I’ll know whereto come in future.’She threwhim a small smile and he moved away so she could serve the next customer. Hestood to one side and sorted out his money. One hundred pounds in his pocketfor Chez and the other fifty he tucked into his wallet.Before heleft the bank he turned and caught the blonde cashier’s eye. He grinned at herand she smiled back. His day was getting better by the minute. Next time hecame in – and there would certainly be a next time – he’d ask her for her name.Outside, hisphone bleeped with a text message. It was from Chez. Meet in 10. Perfecttiming, Jacob thought and texted back, OK. I’ll be there. He began asteady walk up the High Street towards the end of the town. After a couple ofminutes he felt his heartbeat quicken as the adrenalin kicked in, just as thedoctor had explained it would. Although he probably didn’t have this kind ofexercise in mind, Jacob thought to himself – most likely he’d been thinkingalong the lines of using a treadmill in a gym rather than going to buy weed.About The Darkness WithinThe Darkness WithinBy Lisa StonePublished by Avon (13 July 2017)Publisher's descriptionYou know your son better than anyone.

One July morning, Ruth Malone wakes to find a bedroomwindow wide open and her two young children missing. After a desperate search,the police make a horrifying discovery.Noting Ruth's perfectly made-up face and provocativeclothing, the empty liquor bottles and love letters that litter her apartment,the detectives leap to convenient conclusions, fuelled by neighbourhood gossipand speculation. Sent to cover the case on his first major assignment, tabloidreporter Pete Wonicke at first can't help but do the same. But the longer hespends watching Ruth, the more he learns about the darker workings of thepolice and the press. Soon, Pete begins to doubt everything he thought he knew.Ruth Malone is enthralling, challenging and secretive - isshe really capable of murder? My verdictLittle Deaths is a compelling whodunnit set in the 1960s, based on a real case. It's more character led than plot led, with a focus on morality and society at that time. I'd read a lot of hype about this book and was interested to see if it lived up to expectations.Ruth Malone is a mother on the verge of divorce. She's struggling to make ends meet and wants more out of life. She's prepared to take risks to do so, going beyond society's norms, even when her children go missing. Her neighbours steer clear of her, her soon-to-be ex-husband doesn't understand her and the police suspect her of murder. Little Deaths is a fascinating look at the attitudes of disproving neighbours, intrusive press and bigoted police towards women at the time.The mystery of what happened to Ruth Malone's two young children intrigued me, with lots of twists, turns and red herrings. The mesmerising writing certainly sucked me into the story straight away. The characters felt very real and the interaction between them is what, for me, kept the story going. Ruth, in particular, was a complex character, judged by her appearance and behaviour rather than what was inside. The period setting was very well described and highly atmospheric, transporting me right into the heart of 1960s New York, with the sights, sounds and smells of city life in the summer heat.I wasn't 100% sure about the ending, feeling it was a little neat and rushed. But overall, I really enjoyed Little Deaths."},

The first half of the book is a slow-burning build up, establishing the background of the characters, main plot and setting, and I did wonder at first if it was going to be a book for me.However, I'm very happy that I persevered. The second half of the book is written at a much faster pace, filled with revelations, twists and turns. These two families are tied together by circumstances, lies and secrets.

His lawyers, the guarded veteran,Judith, and the energetic young solicitor, Constance, begin a desperate pursuitof the truth, revealing uncomfortable secrets about the teacher and the school.But Judith has her own secrets which she risks exposing when it is announcedthat a new lie-detecting device, nicknamed Pinocchio, will be used during thetrial. And is the accused, a troubled boy who loves challenges, trying to helpthem or not? My verdictThe crime market is flooded with psychological thrillers and domestic noir, so it was a welcome change to read The Pinocchio Brief, which is a courtroom drama and legal investigation.The story centres around quirky & academically gifted 15-year-old Raymond, who has been accused of murdering his teacher at his private school. The two other main characters are his legal team - Judith (the older, experienced and more reserved one) and Constance (younger, more reckless and very enthusiastic).Abi Silver has a great knack of describing her characters, both in terms of appearance and their thoughts and feelings. The chapters alternative between the points of view of Raymond, Judith and Constance. But, unusually, within every scene you get inside each person's head (known as head hopping). I don't often see this in crime fiction.The premise of the novel - a lie-detecting device used in courtroom trials - is an interesting and intriguing one and instantly grabbed my attention. You can tell that the author has a legal background and is also a great researcher, as there's a lot of information packed within the pages. The book is divided into four parts, but I really found it to be a book of two parts. The first half (parts 1 and 2) contained a lot of scene setting, developing the characters and the build up to the courtroom drama. The second half (parts 3 and 4) was written at a much faster pace with lots of surprises.Abi Silver certainly kept me guessing and knows how to plot a twisty book.

{"title": " Racing Against Reality by Matthew Blakstad - Lucky Ghost Blog Tour", "date": "Friday 28 July 2017", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Matt Blakstad to my blog today for his Lucky Ghost blog tour, to talk about 'racing against reality'. Lucky Ghosts was published by Hodder & Stoughton on 27 July 2017. Racing Against RealityBy Matthew BlakstadPhoto credit: Paul TreacyRememberwhen we still thought 2016 was a gruelling year? From the death of David Bowieto the pundit-defying outcome of the US presidential election, those twelveturbulent months left many of us begging for 2017 to begin. I guess we shouldhave been careful what we wished for.For my part,I spent last year writing my second full-length novel, Lucky Ghost. I startedit on the 2nd of January 2016. (On the 1st I confess I was in no fit state.) Bythe time I finished the edit, Trump was president. Like my debut novel, Sockpuppet,my second book is set in the near future. It imagines a world very much likeour own, only more so. A world where people go about wearing digital veilsknown as Mesh, which coat their worlds in comforting virtual illusions. Theycall this augmented reality The Strange.Here’s thething about writing a story set in the near future: you need to keep your eyesclosely trained on the present. As we all know, it takes months – or even years– for a finished novel to make it into bookshops, by which time the world canhave shifted in fundamental ways. Leaving the author’s bleeding-edge vision ofthe future looking as hackneyed as a 1970’s space opera. The risk is low forauthors lucky enough to live in stable times. Right now, though, world eventsare moving faster than an Eastenders storyline – and they’re quite a bit lessplausible. In times like these, the writer can end up in a race againstreality.As I wrote LuckyGhost, real-world events began to accelerate ever faster, forcing me intoconstant revisions. I became a bit like Gromit, frantically constructing a toyrailway line, split seconds before his train runs over it. In June, forinstance, when the EU referendum result came in, I realised that the future Iwas writing about needed to be one where Brexit had already happened. Ideasabout separation – both inside our society, and between Britain and the widerworld – began to write themselves into my story. The Syrian crisis, which wasalready displacing hundreds of thousands of people onto the European continent,threw out the backstory of one of my protagonists, a troubled young hacker withthe online handle Thimblerig. Then came the US election campaign, and thevicious spate of online attacks that plagued it. Attacks that originated inRussia and other former soviet nations. Inside my story, these events helpedshape the Belarusian extortion syndicate that wages a digital attack onBritain. Even 2016’s spate of celebrity deaths, and its impact on our nationalmood, found an analogue in the novel.Yet in spiteof all these conscious responses to an ever-bleaker supply of news, it was onlyin February of this year, as I read through the typeset page proofs of LuckyGhost, that I spotted the most glaring mark that 2016 had left on my story. AsI picked my way through the final typeset pages – a painstaking but immenselyrewarding part of the publication process – I realised that the book’s centralmetaphor, of people who choose to live inside inside a comforting, illusoryversion of reality, was not some fanciful futuristic conceit. it was exactlywhat had been going on around me as I wrote. In a time ofcarefully-targeted fake news, where everyone from Russian hackers to mainstreampolitical campaigns are barraging us with their own preferred versions ofreality; where we’re spending ever more of our time in digital cocoons thatshow us only the things we already believe to be true; where the divides in ourculture have become so starkly drawn that two people’s view of the self-sameevent can be irreconcilably different – in this environment, what else could Ihave chosen to write about, but deadly digital illusions, and the willingconsumers of alternative facts we all risk becoming?Lucky Ghost is a conspiracy thriller for atime when a large part of the world’s population prefers conspiracy theories tofacts. Maybe, in the end, my book has at last caught up with the world aroundit. Time will tell who’s first to cross the finish line.About Matthew BlakstadMatthew Blakstad’s first careerwas as a professional child actor. From the age of ten, he had roles in TVdramas on the BBC and ITV, in films and at theatres including the Royal Court.After graduating from Oxford with a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, hebegan a career in online communications, consulting for a range of clients fromthe BBC to major banks.

AUTHORSI can haveonly one?? Blimey. I love most crime fiction, but I’m especially intopsychological thriller. So I think my favourite author has to be ... Arrrrgh!You fiend. Don’t make me choooose! I refuse. *Harumph*. Let’s just say I lovethem all!... FILMS/MOVIESI lovethriller, plus I workas a script editor for movies too, so it’s a no-brainer. I love crime,gangster, apocalypse/dystopian, supernatural – ALL OF THEM! Okay I’m beingquite dull, aren’t I so let’s say Alien is my favourite. It’s a classic!... TV DRAMASI loved Prisoner Cell Block H as a kid – it wasa real thrill to watch a TV show with women dominating the screen. Now it’sremade as Wentworth Prison and it’sjust as gritty, flamboyant and hard-hitting as ever. I can’t believe it doesn’thave a bigger following in the UK, it’s amazing! Watch it on Channel 5’s 5Starchannel – the fifth series has just begun.... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibalthe Cannibal is a classic, but I think the one that comes to mind now thatknocks him off his top spot is Adam from Barbara Copperthwaite’s Flowers For The Dead. I couldn’t believeI empathised with this guy! I also adored the formidable and terrifying CalebSwitch in Arlene Hunt’s Last One To Die.The sting in the tale for that one was just delicious. As far as female killersgo, I don’t think we have enough of them, but Amy Dunne from Gone Girl is just fantastic. She willstop at NOTHING to get what she wants!... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Gotta be DSJoanne Aspinall from Paula Daly’s crime series set in Lake Windemere (Just What Kind Of Mother Are You?; Keep YourFriends Close; The Mistake I Made; The Trophy Child). I love how ‘ordinary’she is; a real ‘everywoman’ with problems and flaws like any one of us. She’sclever, insightful and has a sharp eye; plus she’s not EXTRAORDINARY like somany female leads are forced to be. Also, her issues with romance and heroverly large bust don’t define her. She is what she is and that’s so RARE in afemale character. ... MURDER WEAPONSAnyone whocan kill someone with an icicle like Jack Frost in Marnie Riches’ The Girl Who Walked In The Shadows getsa big THUMBS UP from me! A murder weapon that handily disappears?? Bonus.    ... DEATH SCENESAs someonewho grew up in the 80s, this has to be Bugs Bunny’s ‘death’ at the hands ofElmer Fudd in the MARCH OF THE VALKYRIES Looney Tunes’ adaptation of Wagner’sclassic opera. No idea what I’m on about? It’s ‘KILL THE RABBIT! KILL THE RABBIT!’of course. Poor little bunny, indeed.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI run myown writing website, Bang2write, sothis means I have to ‘keep up’ with other writing blogs and sites, especiallyones that are screenwriting-based.

WRITING TIPSPeopleoften posit whether character or structure are more important – I say they’reinextricably linked. You can’t have one without the other, regardless ofmedium, because we want stories about ‘characters who DO STUFF [for variousreasons]’.  ... WRITING SNACKSChocolate.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with SD Sykes", "date": "Tuesday 25 July 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome SD SYKESto share her BEST OF CRIME ...... AUTHORSIt’s so difficult to pick one author, butI’m going to say CJ Sansom, as his Shardlake series introduced me to the pleasuresof historical crime fiction, and the interplay between real historical figuressuch as Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII and Sansom’s fascinating range offictional characters.... FILMS/MOVIESA film that has stuck in mind, since Ifirst saw it back in 1985 is Jagged Edge. What I loved about this film wasthe final turn – I really hadn’t seen it coming and I’ve never forgotten thatfeeling of complete shock and yet simultaneous understanding, as the plot fellhorribly into place. I saw the film again recently, and to be honest, it hasn’tworn that well. My twenty-something son guessed the ending very early in thefilm, so perhaps audiences are more attuned to final twists now? But I remember,in my 1980s innocence, loving this film very much.... TV DRAMASI finally caught up with The Bridgerecently (the Swedish version). The first series is probably the best crimedrama I have ever watched on TV. A plot line that brims with suspense and complexcharacterization, and a series climax that really delivers. This is epicwriting. It’s original. It’s shocking and moving, and yes, at times it’s veryfunny.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThis has to be Tom Ripley from The TalentedMr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith. Ripley is systematic, cold-blooded and withouta conscience. He uses murder as a way of solving his problems, in a way that anormal person might write a letter of complaint or make an angry phone call. Henever seems to regret his murders – his only concern is to elude detection. Heis a dangerous, ruthless psychopath, but oddly we find ourselves almost rootingfor him throughout the book, especially as his victims are portrayed as privilegedand arrogant rich boys.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES Saga Norenfrom the Bridge. She is so brave and uncompromising, and yet remains rather vulnerable.I particularly love her bluntness and her disregard for social niceties.  There is no filter when she speaks to others,and this can be both a great strength as she drives her investigations forward,but also a weakness, as she often alienates those in her team. ... MURDER WEAPONSA book thatI very much loved was The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.(Spoiler alert comingup)As a girl, Susie is raped and murdered by a sinister loner who has luredher into his trap – a tent in a field. We don’t lose Susie at this point, as sheremains the narrator of the book – as a ghost, or perhaps a spirit, followingher murderer for years, until she discovers him about to attack another girl.Though unable to take physical form, Susie somehow dislodges a row of longicicles that knock this man off balance, causing him to fall into snowy ravine.He dies immediately and his body will not be discovered for months. It is verysweet revenge indeed.    ... DEATH SCENESA scenethat sticks with me is from The Talented Mr Ripley. Following an argument, Ripleyhas bludgeoned Dickie to death in a rented row boat, and then has to dispose ofboth the body and the boat. He throws Dickie’s body into the sea, weighed downby an oar and then abandons the boat on a remote and rocky stretch ofcoastline. Ripley is panicked initially, but then coldly methodical in hisactions, walking back through the town at night in his swimming trunks, as ifthis was the most normal thing in the world. He knows that drawing attention tohimself at this point could be his downfall, so he holds his nerve withincredible resolution.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m goingto admit to being a fan of Wikipedia. It’s a great place to start your research(though it absolutely should not be where your research ends!) I also lovewww.medievalists.com which publishes essays on such niche, butnevertheless fascinating, subjects as lapdogs in the fourteenth century throughto the contribution of medieval physicians to the field of cardiovascularmedicine. I also enjoy LitHub.com for topical and sometimes provocativediscussion.... WRITING TIPSWritewithout fear – it is always better to get something down than to stare at ablank page. And keep moving forward, as premature editing can kill a novel. Then,when once you’ve written something that you’re happy with, try to put it awayfor a while before you look at it again. Now you will read your work with fresheyes, as it will seem as if somebody else has written it – meaning that you canthen edit dispassionately, without any attachments to your favourite bits. Asthey say, kill your darlings!... WRITING SNACKSVery strongcoffee at 9am, and then Haribo sweets and tea.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Caz Frear", "date": "Monday 24 July 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome CAZ FREARto share her BEST OF CRIME ... ... AUTHORSIt’s sohard to pick just one but if I base it on who has me clawing at the bookshopdoor on the day of publication, it would have to be Tana French.  I’ve read In the Woods that many times that mycopy isn’t so much well-thumbed as battered-to-shreds.  I should probably get a shiny new copy but itwould be like washing your childhood comfort blanket, it just wouldn’t feel thesame…. ... FILMS/MOVIESI loveanything gangster-related but it needs to have heart rather than simply beingtwo hours of ‘very-bad-people-do-very-bad-things’.  DonnieBrasco, starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino, is a near-perfect example ofthis.  For me, the film belongs to Pacino– his portrayal of an aging bit-part gangster, a man on the fringes who nevergot near the power or wealth that he craved, is sublime.  The final few scenes when he realizes……well Iwon’t spoil it…..let’s just say it’s an amazing performance, so full of pathos,and it really should have bagged him his second Oscar IMO! ... TV DRAMASMmmm, Prime Suspect 1 or Line of Duty??  *Pullsthinking face.  Prime Suspect, Ithink.  I first watched it when I was 13and I was instantly blown away.  THATmoment at the end, when George Marlow loses his rag in the interview room andTennison finally knows it’s him, actually winded me.  I’ll never forget it.  I must have watched it twenty-thirty timessince and I’m fairly sure I can recite the whole thing, word-perfect.  In fact, scrap ‘fairly sure’, I know I can! ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’m goingto go with the Coen Brothers/Javier Bardem’s interpretation of Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men.  I’llsheepishly admit that I haven’t read the book and I’m not sure I could now,Javier Bardem’s performance is just so engrained in my mind.  As a killer he’s just so relentless, slayingpractically everyone he meets without a shred of mercy or remorse.  And the hair - only a true psychopath wouldrock that long bowl-cut. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESBack toTana French again but I absolutely love DetectiveCassie Maddox who features in two of her novels, In the Woods and The Likeness.  She’s just so normal in a whip-smart, witty, whollycompassionate kind of way.  It’s also forthis reason that I love DS ManonBradshaw from Susie Steiner’s, Missing Presumed and I can’t wait forthe follow-up.  Peter Robinson’s DCIBanks is also a big fave – never better than in Aftermath which is a master-class in crime fiction.And obviously Superintendent Ted Hastings from Line of Duty.  Who doesn’t love him? ... MURDER WEAPONSDeath bytypewriter – Stephen King’s, Misery.     ... DEATH SCENESIt has tobe Brendan Gleeson’s leap from the top of the bell-tower at the end of InBruges.   Gleeson’s character jumps to his death inorder to save the life of much younger hitman, Ray, and his face expresses somuch in his last 10 seconds – panic, resolve, regret.  It’s an incredibly moving end to a cracker ofa film.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESSword & Scale – a true crime podcast.  They’re up to episode 91 now so you couldliterally lose a week of your life listening to this.  Definitely not for the faint-hearted though –nothing is taboo and a few of the episodes are particularly hard-going.  Like most authors, I visit Google about a hundredtimes a day, all in the name of research. And Twitter, all in the name of procrastination.  ... WRITING TIPSJoin awriting group, a creative writing class, anything that gets you feedback.  It’s a tricky one though - you have to bevery open to feedback but also know how to filter it because at the end of theday, no one knows your book better than you. A very obvious tip is that if the whole group/class is saying thatthere’s an issue with your protagonist/plot/prologue, then there probably is.  However, if only one or two people raise it,it’s something to think about but not necessarily act on. ... WRITING SNACKSTea andpeanut M&Ms.  Water and sugar-snappeas if I’m trying to be good.  It all dependswhat’s in the house, really – I have been known to dip mini Shredded Wheats inNutella because I was deep in rewrites and didn’t have time to shop…. About CAZ FREARCaz grew upin Coventry and spent her teenage years dreaming of moving to London andwriting a novel.Afterfulfilling her first dream, it wasn’t until she moved back to Coventry thirteenyears later that the writing dream finally came true.She has afirst-class degree in History & Politics which she’s put to enormous useover the years by working as a waitress, a shop assistant, a retailmerchandiser and, for the past twelve years, a headhunter. When she’s notagonising over snappy dialogue or incisive prose, she can be found shouting atthe TV when Arsenal are playing or holding court in the pub on topics she knowsnothing about.Caz is thewinner of the Richard & Judy Search for a Bestseller Award 2017.Find Caz Frear on Twitter - @CazziFAbout SWEET LITTLE LIESPublisher's descriptionWhathappens when the trust has gone?CatKinsella was always a daddy's girl.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Chris Curran", "date": "Thursday 20 July 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome CHRIS CURRANto share her BEST OF CRIME ... ... AUTHORSIf I haveto pick just one author then it’s Cathi Unsworth because she is a writer I alwaysrecommend to friends and one who I think should be better known. Her novels areset in the recent past and they have a dark and dirty glamour that is utterly compelling.  Along with the kind of sharp writing andtwisty plots that characterize the best crime novels they also have that elusivequality – real heart. ... FILMS/MOVIESI’mfascinated by how our memories function, or fail to function, and all my booksso far have featured characters struggling with some aspect of memory. So afilm that really resonates with me is Memento.It’s a brilliantly constructed story that takes a fairly standard idea – aprotagonist trying to track down his wife’s killer – and turns it intosomething incredibly rich and complex. The twist is that the hero suffers fromwhat’s called anterograde amnesia brought on by the trauma of the attack. He isunable to form new memories and suffers short-term memory loss every fewminutes. It’s a film that plays with the viewer’s own perceptions of how timeworks and I’d recommend watching it on DVD because it rewards multiple viewings. ... TV DRAMASI wascompletely hooked by Happy Valley.  It makes a refreshing change to have auniformed police officer, who is also a woman, at the centre of a crime drama.Instead of a crumpled male loner, Sarah Lancashire is totally convincing as thematriarch of an extended family and the moral heart of her local community. Theseries has everything: a terrifying villain, heartbreaking tragedy and asprinkling of black humour.    ... FICTIONAL KILLERSMyfavourite Christie novel is the standalone mystery written in the 1960s: Endless Night. In order not to give thegame away I’ll just say that the killer in the book is one I find veryintriguing. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVES C.J. Sansom’sMatthew Shardlake is a lawyer practising during the reign of Henry V111. Like somany great fictional detectives he is an outsider. A hunchback at a time when sucha disability is regarded with suspicion and disgust, Matthew bears his frequenthumiliations with admirable fortitude always trying to do his best for hisordinary clients at the same time as attempting, usually unsuccessfully, toavoid getting tangled up with the royals and their entourage. ... MURDER WEAPONSLike manyreal murderers from her era, Agatha Christie uses poison very creatively. In Dumb Witness the victim is killed byphosphorus and her dying breath appears as a cloud of vapour that the witnessesimagine is her soul escaping from her body.     ... DEATH SCENESMarkBillingham’s villain in Sleepyheaddoesn’t want to kill his victims, but to render them helpless forever. Aftersome false starts, where the women die, he succeeds with Alison and his attackleaves her with locked-in syndrome. As readers we are allowed into her thoughtsand discover that she is a vibrant and courageous girl. Only able to blink, shenevertheless helps detective Tom Thorne to identify her attacker. But she hasno hope of recovery and realizes that the only way she can outwit the villain isto frustrate his desire for her to stay alive. The final pages are incredibly moving.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESA blog Ialways find inspiring is Lizzy Kremer’s PublishingFor Humans. It appears on occasional Mondays and is a series of beautifullywritten musings on writing from a successful literary agent (not my agent bythe way).... WRITING TIPSMonotonousbut satisfying chores are perfect for solving plotting problems providing youdon’t actively think about them and instead let solutions float up from theunconscious. I find ironing is effective in cold weather and some mindlessgardening, like weeding or grass cutting in the summer.  ... WRITING SNACKSEndlessmugs of Earl Grey tea and the occasional slice of toast with crunchy peanutbutter. About CHRIS CURRANChris Curran was born inLondon but now lives in St Leonards-on-Sea near Hastings, on the south coast ofEngland, in a house groaning with books.

AUTHORSSusieSteiner wins this for me. I don’t think a book has ever affected me so much.Rich in tone and humour, empathetic characterization, a true police procedural.It is a masterclass in how to write a smart and classy thriller.... FILMS/MOVIESI love aclosed-set thriller and so I am going to go for Captain Phillips. I love the singleaim of it (survival) and the single location, told almost in real-time. I’m asucker for films like that.... TV DRAMASThe Fallwas pretty much perfect, to me, especially the earlier seasons. I loved thereverse-perspective, from the villain’s point of view, and I loved the depth ofGillian Anderson’s character. Not a cliché in sight.... FICTIONAL KILLERSPerhaps JoeGoldberg from Caroline Kepnes’ series, beginning with YOU. His voice is so verydistinctive, full of intelligent literary references, angst, disordered butreally quite charming thoughts.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESSorry forthe repetition, but Manon Bradshaw of Missing, Presumed and Persons Unknowntakes this prize for me.... MURDER WEAPONSMy friend GX Todd wrote a book called Defender where the weapon (and the apocalypse) comesfrom within, in the form of voices. That was pretty perfect.    ... DEATH SCENESThedenoument in Into the Darkest Corner was one of the best I have ever read. Nospoilers, so I’ll leave it there.... BLOGS/WEBSITESInteresting!I mostly use people to be honest.

{"title": "Do Not Become Alarmed by Maile Meloy - Blog Tour Review", "date": "Monday 10 July 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Do Not Become Alarmed by Maile Meloy. Do Not Become Alarmed was published by Viking (Penguin) on 6 July 2017. Do Not Become AlarmedBy Maile MeloyPublished by Viking (6 July 2017)Publisher's descriptionWhen Liv and Nora decide to take their husbands and childrenon a holiday cruise, everyone is thrilled. The ship's comforts andpossibilities seem infinite. But when they all go ashore in beautiful CentralAmerica, a series of minor mishaps lead the families further from the ship'ssafety. One minute the children are there, and the next they'regone.What follows is a heart-racing story told from theperspectives of the adults and the children, as the distraught parents - nowturning on one another and blaming themselves - try to recover their childrenand their shattered lives. My verdictDo Not Become Alarmed is well written literary fiction, focusing on parents' reactions to the disappearance of their children on an excursion trip during a two week cruise. The book highlights corruption, drugs and murder within Central America, so has some dark underlying themes.The events are told from the perspectives of the parents and the children. I enjoyed the children's version of the events far more than the parents', finding it difficult to sympathise with, and warm to, the adults. I didn't find the book particularly emotional. However, I was intrigued enough to keep reading to find out what happened to the children and families by the end.The families involved are all wealthy and successful. One key message from the plot seemed to be that wealth can't buy you commonsense, happiness or breeding, judging from the parents' behaviour. I wasn't totally sure why one particular thread was there, other than to show the rich-poor divide.This book is marketed as a 'heart-racing' story, but I didn't find this to be the case. Instead, I found it to be a slow burner, focusing on family dynamics and changing friendships when dealing with every parent's worst nightmare. It took me a few chapters to get into the story, possibly because I was expecting something else - but once I realised this wasn't going to be a fast-paced read with lots of twists and turns, I focused on the vivid descriptions and atmospheric setting.I suspect that readers who love fast-paced thrillers may be disappointed. And I also suspect that this could be a marmite book for the summer season - people may either love it or hate it, depending on their expectations.Follow the Blog Tour"},

AUTHORSI’m a hugefan of Liz Nugent’s work, she has a knack of making you feel sympathy for some prettydespicable characters! And there’s a wonderful dark humour to her writing. Ifyou haven’t read Unravelling Oliver yet then you really should, it’s one of akind. And Missing, Presumed by Susie Steiner was one of the best books I readin the last year, although I did hate her a little for writing so well.Finally, everyone should read Dangerous Crossing by Rachel Rhys this summerbecause it is glorious treat of a novel.... FILMS/MOVIESSilence ofthe Lambs. Those teeth!! I couldn’t sleep for weeks afterwards. But the characterizationin the film was phenomenal, that was made it stand out, not all the gore orviolence. Just a character who could get right under your skin and stay therefor a long while afterwards.... TV DRAMASI recentlyfinished watching Big Little Lies which I thought was TV at its best, one ofthose programmes that turns out to be so much more than you expect. I’d readthe book, but this was a rare case of the screen adaptation being even better(for me at least.) We’re also big fans of House of Cards in our house. AlthoughTrump’s presidency has made everything look tame.... FICTIONAL KILLERSI readFiona Cummins' Rattle late last year and I have to say she created one of themost unnerving, unsettling serial killers I have ever come across. Also Cady,in Cape Fear, the way he keeps coming back no matter what you through at him. Ithink it’s the mix of intellect and knowledge and a psychopathic personalitythat is so potent.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESDempsey andMakepeace. I’m probably showing my age here but it was one of the first policeshows I was allowed to watch. I wanted Makepeace’s wardrobe, I can’t say I wasall that interested in the crime fighting side of things. I also grewup readying Nancy Drew. It’s probably thanks to her that from an early age Itried to find a mystery in everything.... MURDER WEAPONSThe deepfat fryer in Spooks, where the bad guy puts Lisa Faulkner’s head into the pan.Does that count? I remember watching it thinking, no, he’s not going to dothat… surely he can’t… oh look, he is! It still gives me the heebie jeebies.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI don’t useone specific site for research, but my search history isn’t pretty. Forresearch I hunt experts down and threaten to kill them off in a book if theydon’t help me. It’s amazing how receptive they are. But seriously, I’ve foundpeople are extremely helpful as long as you don’t demand anything, and thelevel of research varies a lot from book to book. With my debut Precious ThingI had very little to do as part of it was set in a newsroom and I’d spent allmy career working in them. With The Life I Left Behind I relied on a group ofabout four or five experts to hold my hand. They were phenomenally generouswith their time.... WRITING TIPSI’m at thestage of booking writing where I wish I could give myself some tips! It doesn’tget any easier. One thing that makes authors groan is when people say, I’d loveto write a book but I haven’t got time.’ No one has time. Quit watching TV, sayno to invitations, become a hermit. Great books have been written in 20 minuteschunks on a Tube, it’s more a question of how much you want it.Also, know what your story is, and by that Idon’t mean a synopsis of the plot, I mean the essence of it, its beating heart.... WRITING SNACKSThis verymuch depends on the time of the day because I pretty much eat continuously. Midmorning and I’m still delusionally healthy so I’ll graze on fruit but byafternoon I’m mainlining the dark chocolate, any gluten free biscuits or cake Ican get my hands on. If I’m working in the evening I call in the heavies;crisps, nuts and wine (one glass otherwise I can’t write.) It’s no wonder thatby the end of a book I have to prize my backside out of the chair.About COLETTE MCBETHColette spent more than a decade at the BBC, working as anational television news correspondent.

AUTHORSIt’s sodifficult to choose one author but James Lee Burke wins the day. His DaveRobicheaux books pull you into the world of Louisiana crime and rarely let youcome up for air. Burke’s prose can be spare and beautiful, sometimes evenpoetic like the some of the best crime writers, yet he writes unflinchinglyabout the most brutal of events and takes you right into the heads and heartsof his characters. At his best, his books have a page-turning intensity that’shard to match.... FILMS/MOVIESFargo. I’ve loved the movie for years and reallyenjoyed the recent TV remake, too. The combination of top class characterizationand performance, brilliant direction, action from both criminal and lawenforcement points of view, elements of a classic detective murder mystery anddarkest possible comedy is genius.... TV DRAMASTrue Detective (Series 1). It’s ultra-classy. The setting,cinematography and soundtrack are pitch perfect, but what gripped me most wasthe relationship between the two detectives that played out both past andpresent. It’s a complex, difficult and fascinating relationship that occasionallyfeels as brutal as the crime itself.... FICTIONAL KILLERSIt’s notstrictly a crime series, but when Kevin Spacey’s character, Frank Underwood,first kills in House of Cards it’sshocking. Frank Underwood is one of the most cold-blooded, ambitious, calculatingand, on the surface, surprising killers I’ve ever come across. That he holdssuch power and will stop at nothing to maintain or increase it provokes a veryvisceral fear in me.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESFriedrich Dürrenmatt’sdetective, Matthäi, is a favourite. Matthäi appears in his novel The Pledge which is tellingly subtitled Requiem for the Detective Novel. Matthäiis an exceptional detective but the story of his investigation into the murdersof young girls in The Pledge is atough one. Dürrenmatt felt that crime fiction was too often neat and tidy inoffering up a resolution to a case so long as the detective followed a seriesof logical steps, a bit like doing a mathematical equation. Spoiler alert! In The Pledge, Dürrenmatt sets out to provide an alternative type ofcrime novel. After we follow Matthäi through the years and witness hisincreasingly desperate attempts to resolve the investigation, the ending of thebook reveals it was a freak automobile accident that prevented him fromcatching the killer. A twist of fate ensured that he never had a chance. Dürrenmatt’sdepiction of Matthäi is a brilliant character study of a man whosedetermination, brilliance, gut instinct and dedication to solving this crime ultimatelyprove futile and self-destructive. The story is unflinching, very human andgritty with reality. ... MURDER WEAPONSSpoiler alert! In Roald Dahl’s short story Lamb to the Slaughter, the victim iskilled by his wife who delivers a blow to his head with a frozen leg of lamb.Later the same day, she cooks the lamb and serves it to the detectives investigatingthe case. They are friends of her husband. As he chews his meat and they discussthe murder weapon, one of the detectives says, ‘It’s probably right under ourvery noses.’ In the room next door, the killer overhears. She giggles. It’sextremely creepy and a brilliant idea.... DEATH SCENESThe murderscene that’s at the core of His BloodyProject by Graeme McCrae Burnett is horrific. It’s visited and revisited afew times by different characters throughout the book who testify as to whatthey saw or heard, and ultimately by the murderer himself in a first personaccount of the scene that’s unbearably desperate and brutal.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESIt’s notstrictly a blog or a website, but I’m addicted to true crime podcasts so I’dlike to pick one of my favourites: AustralianTrue Crime. Presented by journalists/authors Emily Webb and Meschel Laurithe podcast claims to: ‘Go beyond the news cycle to find out how people becomekillers, how people become victims, and what happens next,’ and it delivers. Ican’t get enough of it.... WRITING TIPSPayattention to all the different elements in a novel. Writing fiction is a craftthat needs honing, but remember that only one question really matters wheneveryou make a creative decision or write a paragraph: ‘Will the reader want tokeep on turning pages?’ As an obsessive reader myself, I believe it’s thesingle most important thing a book can deliver, no matter what the genre....

Withoutgiving anything away (is there anyone left who hasn’t seen it?) it’s the bestending I’ve ever seen, and the very definition of hiding in plain sight.... TV DRAMASThe Wire.It was my indoctrination to the world of box sets, just after my second babywas born. My husband and I watched one episode per night to make it last aslong as possible, and spent months getting through the whole five series. Forme, The Wire is a reminder that crime drama is always more entertaining whencarried out by and to multi-faceted, intriguing characters, and plots are moreinteresting when they can’t be wrapped up and forgotten in a forty-two minuteepisode of Criminal Minds.... FICTIONAL KILLERSFrankUnderwood in House of Cards. I don’t mean I approve of his methods, but it’sfascinating to watch. And because the occasional murder is just a means to anend for him, he doesn’t get his comeuppance and we get to continue watching hisdastardly deeds.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESJacksonBrodie in Kate Atkinson’s books. The tough-exterior-soft-inside detective isn’ta new idea but it’s done so well by Atkinson, it never drifts anywhere nearcliché. Jackson’s voice is distinctive and consistent, and his decisions areutterly believable.... MURDER WEAPONSA leg oflamb in Roald Dahl’s short story Lamb to the Slaughter, which the murderer thenroasted and fed to the investigating officers. I read that story as a teen andit has always stayed with me. (My husband is going to worry now, the next timeI cook lamb.)... DEATH SCENESThe mosthorrific and memorable death scene I’ve ever read was Simon’s in Lord of theFlies. It’s years and years since I read the book but it’s one that’s hard toshake. The horror and savagery of the out of control boys was so hard toimagine but at the same time, far too easy to imagine, and still is.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI mostlyuse good old Google for research, and stop every now and then to marvel at howeasy it is. I’m working now on a book that’s partly set in New York, and intoday’s chapter, a character meets her mother for lunch in the East Village.

WRITING TIPSThe besttip I ever got was just start writing and see where you end up. If you take toolong deciding what to write about and wondering whether or not to use Scriveneror plain old Word, you might never get started.

Dying to Live is being published by Orenda Books on 12 July 2017.Dying to LiveBy Michael StanleyPublished by Orenda Books (12 July 2017)Publisher's descriptionWhen the body of a Bushman isdiscovered near the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the death is written off asan accident. But all is not as it seems. An autopsy reveals that, although he'sclearly very old, his internal organs are puzzlingly young. What's more, an oldbullet is lodged in one of his muscles... but where is the entry wound? Whenthe body is stolen from the morgue and a local witch doctor is reportedmissing, Detective 'Kubu' Bengu gets involved. But did the witch doctor takethe body to use as part of a ritual? Or was it the American anthropologistwho'd befriended the old Bushman? As Kubu and his brilliant young colleague,Detective Samantha Khama, follow the twisting trail through a confusion ofrhino-horn smugglers, foreign gangsters and drugs manufacturers, the wider andmore dangerous the case seems to grow. A fresh, new slice of 'Sunshine Noir', Dyingto Live is a classic tale of greed,corruption and ruthless thuggery, set in one of the world's most beautifullandscapes, and featuring one of crime fiction's most endearing and humaneheroes. My verdictDying to Live fits into the crime genre 'sunshine noir', thanks to its dark plots set in a sunny climate. The term 'sunshine noir' also describes how this series makes me feel. The stories explore the vile side of human nature, yet somehow still manage to lift my mood. Each time, it's like coming back to an old friend - slightly older and slightly wiser - with familiar places and familiar characters.I always feel like I've learnt something about African culture by the time I've reached the end of a Detective Kubu book. Dying to Live is no exception, covering a diverse range of topics (yet again), including traditional medicines, HIV and AIDS, illegal drug manufacturing, local bushmen and rhino-horn smuggling, Fascinating stuff!This Detective Kubu series is as much about the Botswana setting and colourful characters as the underlying plots themselves. While there's a lot of police procedural in these books, it's broken up perfectly with Kubu's personal life. Detective Kubu is a family man - not the usual damaged detective seen so often in modern crime fiction. His personal problems are very much family problems, which makes him not only realistic but also extremely likeable.I can't recommend this series highly enough. This is sunshine noir at its best, with plenty of twists, turns and surprises. The next Detective Kubu book can't come soon enough.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Worse still, his memory is a blank... Reeling from the death of his great love, Karin, Varg Veum'slife has descended into a self-destructive spiral of alcohol, lust, grief andblackouts.When traces of child pornography are found on his computer,he's accused of being part of a paedophile ring and thrown into a prison cell.There, he struggles to sift through his past to work out who is responsible forplanting the material... and who is seeking the ultimate revenge.When a chance to escape presents itself, Varg finds himselfon the run in his hometown of Bergen. With the clock ticking and the police onhis tail, Varg takes on his hardest - and most personal - case yet. My verdictThis is my third Gunnar Staalesen book, published by Orenda Books (although it's the 21st book in the Varg Veum series). It's definitely the darkest yet, and is also my favourite so far.Private investigator Varg Veum is at his lowest - a total wreck following the death of the love of his life. He's spiralled into a self-destructive lifestyle, fuelled by alcohol and peppered with periods of memory loss. When he's arrested and jailed for possessing images of child pornography, he is convinced someone must have hacked into his computer system. Which means someone has it in for him. But who and why?Wolves in the Dark takes the reader on a snapshot ride through Veum's past, focusing on some key cases that he never managed to resolve due to his drunken state at the time. Now, as he sobers up, he's in a far better position to search for the truth. But the cases are more convoluted than he remembers.I was as puzzled as he was, with no idea who was to blame for his current predicament, and the plot kept me guessing all the way through. I was gripped from beginning to end, and had to slow down my reading in places to take it all in.As expected, the book is beautifully written and also beautifully translated. The subject matter is not just dark but uncomfortable too, yet it's not graphic at all. The writing flows, and you really get inside Velum's muddled head.I'm looking forward to the next Varg Veum book - and hope it's not too long to wait!I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

AUTHORSIt’s got to be Tom Wolfe, if only for Bonfire of theVanities. Wolfe showed us that you can write about a crime and show all sidesof society, top to bottom, with acid wit, enthralling characters, dazzlinglanguage and compassion at the same time. I challenge anyone to read hisdescriptions of the justice system in New York, and not cry with rage. Sadly, Isat recently with a prosecuting barrister in Camberwell, South London, and theprocess there looked horribly familiar. ... FILMS/MOVIESNightcrawler, written and directed by Dan Gilroy, with JakeGyllenhaal as a desperate, second-rate criminal who finds a career filmingcrimes and fatal accidents for TV. A brilliant but overlooked dark satiricalnoir it was the best film out in 2015 for me, and while it received manynominations, I still can’t believe it didn’t win any awards. ... TV DRAMASThe Shield, by a mile. From the opening, jaw-dropping,episode where (spoiler alert) one cop kills another who’s about to rat on him,you know that this series will have a tragic arc and at the same time keep youconstantly surprised. Detective Vic Mackay is one of the great conflictedanti-heroes in crime drama and you just have to stay with him to find out howit all ends. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI tend to be drawn to strong satirical anti-heroes, and theydon’t come stronger than Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. Like Wolfe, BretEaston Ellis has a way of combining wit and insight to create character.Bateman, like many great villains, makes you feel he’d be a riveting dinnercompanion – as long as you didn’t end up as dinner. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESI’d love to say my son’s wayward Hampstead DC, Nick Belsey,but that would be nepotism, so instead I’m going for The Saint – however notthe sweetened Roger Moore TV version. Simon Templar, as originally written byLeslie Charteris, is a much more interesting character on the page - edgier andmore street-wise, not averse to killing for justice. I’ve never told anyonebefore, but for many years in my teens, my secret aim was to grow up to do whathe did. Well, I now deal out justice, and even kill people, albeit on the page,and even run a martial arts dojo on a Charteris Road. Who’d have thought it?... MURDER WEAPONSA very noir weapon this one – a woman’s body. If I rememberright, it comes from a Simon Templar short story. A rich young man dies playingleapfrog over his fiancée on a diving board but instead of going into thewater, he hits the side of the pool and breaks his neck. Templar investigatesand works out that the woman, who is expert in judo, shifted subtly as hejumped over her, to redirect his dive, and inherit his money. Sex, money,Freudian imagery, it has everything.    ... DEATH SCENESThe spontaneous combustion of Krook, a rag and bottlemerchant in Dickens’ Bleak House. Just to show that even great writers can beplayful and totally mad when they want to be.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThere are parts of the Internet that many have never haveheard of.

Enter the mysterious and ethereal Jenny: the girl Poppydiscovers after hacking into India's laptop. What is exactly is she hiding, andwhat did India find out about her?My verdictThe Other Twin is a modern psychological thriller delving into the Brighton party scene and the hazards of social media.Poppy returns to Brighton after her sister falls to her death off a railway bridge. She doesn't believe official reports, and decides to delve into her sister's life. Hacking into India's laptop and blog, Poppy uncovers secrets, lies and toxic friendships.The Other Twin is filled with highly descriptive prose, an amazing sense of place and authentic dialogue. The characters are strong, believable, diverse and suitably flawed, as I would expect from a screenwriter. The multi-layered plot kept me engrossed all the way through. Each layer was gradually peeled away to reveal yet another surprise (I admit I did guess some but not all).It was very hard to put this book down, and I devoured most of it in one sitting. The book continues at a cracking pace and could easily be transferred to the big (or small) screen. This is certainly a novel in keeping with the times, particularly in terms of subject matter. I don't want to give anything away, but it was exactly what I expected from the author, having followed her screenwriting blog for some time - diversity being the key.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher and have reviewed the book for Lovereading."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Amer Anwar", "date": "Monday 26 June 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome AMER ANWARto share his BEST OF CRIME ... ... AUTHORSSorry, I'vetried… but simply can't pick just one. I'm going for the three I feel have hadthe most direct influence on me as a writer and whose books I regularly tend tore-read. They also happen to be three of my all-time favourite authors too.They are Elmore Leonard, Richard Stark and Joe R. Lansdale. All are American and feature characters that aresometimes, or always, on the wrong side of the law. Each of them has an easy,lean style and tells tales full of action with a side of dark humour. I can'tget enough of them. ... FILMS/MOVIESI lovemovies and could list a whole host of them but will restrain myself as best Ican and mention a few of my absolute favourite crime flicks. Heat, muscular and intense, and therobbery scenes are simply superb. Goodfellas,perhaps the best gangster movie ever and one of the most realistic, or so EddieBunker said, and he would've known. Seven,dark, devious and totally original. I went to a preview screening knowingabsolutely nothing about the film – for some reason, I thought it was going tobe a comedy – and I was totally gobsmacked by it. Then there's The Sting, an absolute classic capermovie. ... TV DRAMASTV dramashave come a long way in recent years. There are so many great ones, I couldrattle off another long list. But… I'm going to go for one that I feel kind ofled the way for the sort of long-form storytelling we now expect from TV dramas– The Sopranos. I watched it when itwas first broadcast in the UK, on Channel 4, 10 pm Monday nights. I watchedevery season like that – it was way before box set binges were a thing – and Iabsolutely loved it. The character development was great, the story arcsstretched across episodes, even seasons, it had the space and depth of a good bookand felt like nothing else on TV at the time. Plus, it was unapologeticallyadult. The language and violence had never really been portrayed quite likethat on TV before. It was groundbreaking and just a fabulous TV show. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibal Lecter  – a bitof an obvious choice perhaps, but I read the books way before the films madethe character a household name and he was such a fascinating creation. And bothRed Dragon and Silence of the Lambs are excellent crime novels in their own right.I also really like Dexter. Making aserial killer into the \"hero\" and actually have you like him, is avery neat twist. While not an out-and-out killer, Richard Stark's Parker is a professional armed robberwho has no qualms about killing anyone who gets in his way – as he does,numerous times, over the course of more than 20 novels. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESYou know, Ididn't really realise it before now, but looking at my bookshelves in the hopeof an obvious answer to this question, it strikes me that even though I've reada lot of crime novels, I've never really followed a detective series. I mayhave read one or two books of a series and meant to get back to them but forthe most part, it seems my crime reading has focused on the shadier side of thestreet, characters who are either a little or very definitely, dodgy. Theexception to that is Philip Marlowe,whose voice and wit really drew me in.But inresponse to this question, my answer is going to be Raylan Givens, the modern day US Marshal, who likes to wear acowboy hat and is quick on the draw. He's more of a supporting character in hisfirst appearance in Elmore Leonard's Prontobut took a more central role in the follow-up, Riding the Rap. Then the character made the transition to TV in thehit show, Justified. The great thingwas the creators of the show were huge Elmore Leonard fans and wanted to staytrue to the feel of Leonard's writing, so much so that they had him as anexecutive producer and ran scripts by him, to get the feel right. The characterjust grew and grew. Leonard's own fondness for the character grew too, so muchso, that his final book was about him and simply titled, Raylan.... MURDER WEAPONSOK, so,it's not from a crime novel but from a horror novel I read back in my teens –but it's stayed with me all this time, so that's what I've chosen it. There's ascene where a priest is confronted by a vampire in a church and he grabs up aheavy metal crucifix from to altar to ward it off, thinking the creature willshrink away in fear. The vampire just laughs and sneers and says somethinglike, he never believed in that stuff when he was alive, why the hell's itgoing to have any effect now he's dead? The priest is stumped. The vampireattacks… and the priest uses the crucifix as a weapon and bludgeons the vampireto death. It wasn't at all what I expected to happen! I'd be really impressedif anyone can name the novel. I've only ever met one other person who's readit!    ... DEATH SCENESFor once, ashort answer. The end of Perfume by Patrick Süskind. If you've read it,you'll know and if you haven't, well… It's all of the above – horrific,bizarre, amusing and surprising. The whole book is a very unusual and wonderfulsort of crime novel but not like anything else you might have read. One of myall-time favourite books.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESFor Western Fringes, I guess I'd have tosay Google Maps and Street View. I know the areas that aredepicted in the book and most of the time I could envisage where things weretaking place, but had the ability to double-check details right from mycomputer, to figure out routes and locations. That said, nothing beats actuallygoing to places and experiencing them for real, which I did do, armed with anotebook and camera. But when you need to refresh your memory or plan somethingout to do with location etc. it's a real help. And you can do it in yourpyjamas without having to brave the sometimes awful weather outside. ... WRITING TIPSGet the first draft done! Just get your ideas down, on paperor on screen, however you write, but just do it. Don't worry about making itsound right or pretty, that all comes later when you get into the editingstage. Just get the whole thing down, from start to finish, so you have acompleted manuscript (yay!) – no matter how rough. That's a great feeling initself.Then youcan go back over it and edit and make it better. That's when you can make cutsand improvements. You'll have a greater understanding of the overall story and willbe able to find better ways of conveying what you want, better words, betterideas. You'll be able to chop and change things, add new scenes, new characters– but all because you've got a complete story to work with.A bit like beinga sculptor or painter – you need to chisel out or paint the rough shape of apiece first then, then go over it to give it definition and form, beforefinally concentrating on the details. ... WRITING SNACKSI don'tgenerally snack at the computer while working. I do drink either tea, coffee orwater depending on what I'm in the mood for. At the moment, I tend to break forlunch and read for a little while, then get back to work. If I have to get upto do something and venture into the kitchen, I might grab a handful of mixedsalted nuts or, if I happen to have any, a little bit of dark chocolate as atreat.About AMER ANWARAmer Anwargrew up in West London.

Jane Lythell clearly knows her subject, having worked in TV for years, and this shines through in her writing with so much detail described - in terms of setting, daily lives and people's rising emotions. It was fascinating reading, filled with secrets, lies, ambition and power. Some things made me laugh, others brought tears to my eyes - and then there was some events that made me cringe. There are a wide range of characters, many with big egos and others that I couldn't help but hate.The chapters alternate between Liz's work life and her home life, showing how she juggles the two (often struggling to do so) and how each impacts upon the other, shaping her responses to people and events. This book explores whether working women really can have it all - being good mothers while rising in their careers. It also looks at the trials and tribulations of single motherhood and dealing with feisty teenagers.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the author."},

AUTHORSMyfavourite crime author would have to be Val McDermid, especially the Tony Hillseries of books. I could read them over and over again. I love main characterswho are just a bit ‘off’ and strange. I enjoy the different threads andstorylines running throughout her books/ ... FILMS/MOVIESMyfavourite film is A Few Good Men – may be a bit dated now but the tension throughoutthat film gets me every time. I find it a good lesson in taut writing. Not onescene in that film is wasted and is used to move the story forward. I also likethat the Aaron Sorkin resisted the temptation to include a romance for the sakeof it. The film didn’t need it. ... TV DRAMASMyfavourite TV drama would be Rebus. I absolutely love the stories and the dramaand the character of Rebus himself. Can I also shout out to Vera as well. Shereminds me of Kim Stone in twenty years time.... FICTIONAL KILLERSMy all timefavourite would be Hannibal Lecter. Too scary! His complete lack of conscienceis fascinating and repulsive at the same time.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESKathyMallory from the Carol O’Connell novels. Like Tony Hill she is a bit off.

The Mayfly is published by Zaffre on 15 June 2017.The MayflyBy James HazelPublished by Zaffre (15 June 2017)Publisher's descriptionA mutilated body discovered in the woods.A murderous plan conceived in the past.A reckoning seventy years in the making . . .When lawyer Charlie Priest is attacked in hisown home by a man searching for information he claims Priest has, he is drawninto a web of corruption that has its roots in the last desperate days of WorldWar Two. When his attacker is found murdered the nextday, Priest becomes a suspect and the only way to clear his name is to find outabout the mysterious House of Mayfly - a secret society that people will killfor. As Priest races to uncover the truth, can he prevent history from repeatingitself?  My verdictThe Mayfly is a fast-paced crime thriller. My interest was piqued from beginning to end and I found myself racing through the final chapters, with no idea how the jigsaw pieces would slot into place.The author has clearly done his research and developed a multilayered and complex plot. But knowing a lot about Holocaust, I would have liked a few more flashbacks to convey the horrors of that time - particularly conditions in the camp and the experimentation that was at the heart of the book's story. There was some of this in the early chapters, but I felt more background would have helped to explain further the whole 'how and why' of the plot (i.e. the development of the secret society).Charlie Priest is intriguing, quirky and likeable, clearly shaped by events in his past (including his serial killer brother), plus there were some other great memorable characters too. Although the book covers serious issues, there were a few well-placed lighter moments to break up the darkness.Overall, The Mayfly was an enjoyable read - an impressive debut and a great start to a new series. Looking forward to the next Charlie Priest book to see how the characters, and series, develop.Follow the Blog Tour"},

All the Good Things was published by Penguin on the 1st June 2017.Read my review ...All the Good ThingsBy Clare FisherPublished by Penguin (1 June 2017)Publisher's descriptionTwenty-one year old Beth isin prison. The thing she did is so bad she doesn't deserve ever to feel goodagain.But her counsellor, Erika, won't give up on her.She asks Beth to make a list of all the good things in her life. So Beth startsto write down her story, from sharing silences with Foster Dad No. 1, toflirting in the Odeon on Orange Wednesdays, to the very first time she sniffedher baby's head.But at the end of her story, Beth must confront thebad thing.What is the truth hiding behind her crime? Anddoes anyone - even a 100% bad person - deserve a chance to be good?My verdictAll the Good Things is a well-written book that highlights thought-provoking issues, particularly those surrounding motherhood.Beth has done something bad, really bad, which is why she's in prison. She's now ready to give up on life. But her counsellor tells her to write down all the good things that have happened to her over the years, to prove that she's still good deep inside.All the Good Things isn't about the bad thing that Beth did. It's not about why she's being punished for it either. It's about why the bad thing happened and what led to it. This story of Bethany's life took me on an emotional rollercoaster and made me cry several times. It addressed heartbreaking social issues, and the consequences of NHS cuts - a girl let down by the system, left on her own with serious repercussions.The book is very moving and felt very real. While it isn't necessarily a book to 'enjoy' due to the subject matter, it's certainly one that leaves a lasting impression.Highly recommended!I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

AUTHORSI thinkStephen King is a force to be reckoned with. He’s a diverse writer, and though mostpeople would associate him with the supernatural genre, Misery has to be one of the most unsettling and finest crime novelsof all time. He’s prolific and he’s fantastic at tension and pace. What I alsolove is that he’s a writer for the people, a true democratic choice.  ... FILMS/MOVIESTheTalented Mr Ripley. Oh my goodness, no matter how many times I see that film Inever stop wanting it to end differently. The narrative is so clever it has usrooting for Tom, because he’s presented as the underdog, and each murder isbeyond his control. It’s star-studded, with Matt Damon, Jude Law and SeymourHoffman and Gwyneth Paltrow, and they are all first rate. If you haven’t seenit you’re in for a treat! ... TV DRAMASI reallyloved River, especially the melancholic idea that the protagonist detectiveworks with his partner, who is dead, in his head. There’s a scene where he’s singlingin a Karaoke bar, alone, but imagining they’re together. Truly heartbreaking. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHumbertHumbert is such a clever killer that he almost fools us of his innocence. (Hisinterest in Lolita is about to be exposed by her mother when she is`accidently` run over). In the narrative, told entirely from Humbert’s point ofview, we are encouraged to see him not as a predatory paedophile but as aprotective figure. My old copy of this book described it as a `romance` which Ithink sums up how effective Nabokov was in portraying this Saville-likemonster.   ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESClariceStarling, because she’s vulnerable but fierce, a compelling combination.

When Murder, She Wrote started in 1984, a time when Morse was stilltrying to hit on every woman in sight, and the ladies in his show were renderedmute by the sight of blood, JB was what we’ve come to recognise as a strong femalecharacter.

At thesame time, a hot-air balloon crashes out of the sky. There’s just one survivor.She’s seenthe killer’s face – but he’s also seen hers. And he won’t rest until he’seliminated the only witness to his crime.Alone,scared, trusting no one, she’s running to where she feels safe – but it couldbe the most dangerous place of all . . .My verdict Yet again, Sharon Bolton has written an intriguing psychological thriller. It's hard to review Dead Woman Walking without giving too much away, so I'm having to tread very carefully and tell you as little as possible about the plot itself.Dead Woman Walking begins with a dramatic scene as a gunman brings down a hot air balloon. This is in the blurb, so I can get away with mentioning that. Much of the book continues at a cracking pace, with a rollercoaster cat and mouse chase across Scottish terrain as the only survivor, a young woman, escapes from the killer. Some of that's in the blurb too.Other than that, all I can really say is that Dead Woman Walking is exceptionally plotted, with some great twists and turns, as expected from this author, although it was a little far fetched in places. The tension and thrills keep on coming, and the chilling plot weaves a tangled web. There's a whole host of interesting, intriguing and somewhat bizarre characters (including some very entertaining nuns). Chapters span past and present, helping the jigsaw pieces slot into place by the final page.What a rollercoaster ride - exhausting at times!

TV DRAMASThe firsttwo series of The Bridge. Totally ridiculous murder plots, but the relationshipbetween Saga Noren and Martin Rohde was wonderful.... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’mprobably a hopeless crime writer, because I don’t have enough interest in thekiller. I accept that bad stuff happens, but my interest is in what looking forthe cause of badness does to the people who have to try and fix it. So my idealfictional killer is actually Harry Lime from Graham Greene’s The Third Man.Harry Lime is actually a bonafide monster who profits from racketeering inpenicillin. He doesn’t kill anyone directly; but by his actions, he leaves astring of dead and disabled behind him because he waters the stuff down andsells it back at a profit. That’s real evil, you see.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESGod. My answers are really showing how old I am.

AUTHORSDaphne duMaurier’s Rebecca is my favouritebook of all time, it has everything – intrigue, mystery, romance, and it’s multilayered with a great twist. Lee Child is my favourite contemporary author, Ilove the pace and detail of the Reacher books -what’s not to love about a 6 foot 5 inch ex US Military Police hunk? ... FILMS/MOVIESTheShawshank Redemption based on Stephen King’s short story. Morgan Freeman’svoice is as important as the superb script by Frank Darabont. It shows the best and the worst of human nature, and isall about integrity and hope. The concept of freedom is paramount – it showshow your spirit can be free even if you are incarcerated, and that even peoplewho are essentially free on the outside, can be trapped by their thoughts oroutlook. One of the central scenes when the corridors of Shawshank StatePenitentiary  are filled with theMozart’s ‘Letter Duet’ from The Marriage of Figaro is unforgettable. ... TV DRAMASI rarely get time to watch TV, but I adore House ofCards. I was also completely hooked by the Making a Murderer series, appalledin equal measures by the system and the individuals involved.... FICTIONAL KILLERSDr Hannibal Lecter is just completelychilling. Educated, a match for his pursuers, in Thomas Harris’ books he isantagonist, protagonist and antihero. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESThere areso many brilliant ones - I love Karin Slaughter’s Sara Linton, she’s redhaired, calm and intelligent but I’m also mad about Alex Barclay’s bi polar FBIagent, Ren Bryce – she’s always on the edge of getting into serious trouble. ... MURDER WEAPONSOne of the more gruesome murder weapons I read aboutrecently was a nail gun. A Chinesestudent  was murdered with one in Australiain 2008. His body was found wrapped in a carpet and bound with electrical wires- 34 nails had been fired into his skull.    ... DEATH SCENESJanetEvanovitch’s Stephanie Plum series is utterly hilarious and just brilliant – Ican never think about a funeral home without thinking of Grandma Mazur. There are more mad, crazy deathsin her series than any other!“Anddon’t shoot him or gas him or fry his hair with your stun gun.” “Yougot a lot of rules,” Lula said (Fearless Fourteen)   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESCouldn’tlive without Google Street View – I visit all my locations but sometimes I needto check something and it’s invaluable. I also use a site called Myhome.ie toget the interiors of my characters houses right. Very practical and boring. Butfor IN DEEP WATER, the second book in the Cat Connolly series I did a lot oftrawling around the Deep Web. I won’t give you addresses in case you end up onan NSA watchlist. ... WRITING TIPSJust keepwriting was the best advice I was ever given. And if you get stuck, go back towhere it was working and retrace your steps, usually a character has saidsomething out of character or you’ve made a mistake and your subconscious isputting the brakes on. ...

Lily Shepherd leaves England on an ocean liner forAustralia, escaping her life of drudgery for new horizons. She is instantlyseduced by the world onboard: cocktails, black-tie balls and beautiful sunsets.Suddenly, Lily finds herself mingling with people who would otherwise nevergive her the time of day.But soonshe realizes her glamorous new friends are not what they seem. The rich andhedonistic Max and Eliza Campbell, mysterious and flirtatious Edward, andfascist George are all running away from tragedy and scandal even greater thanher own.By the timethe ship docks, two passengers are dead, war has been declared, and life willnever be the same again.My verdictDangerous Crossing is a captivating journey back through time with a highly authentic feel. It's set in pre-war 1930s, an era filled with uncertainty and people hoping for a better life, bravely sailing off into the vast unknown. This is Lily's story, as she boards an ocean liner for Australia, leaving her family and loved ones behind.The book is a slow burning murder mystery amid political and social unrest, as a young girl is thrown into a world of glamour, cocktails, romance, deception, lies and scandal. It's definitely a book to be savoured, with compelling writing and rich descriptions. Every detail is so clearly described that I couldn't fail to picture the setting in my mind - each of my senses stimulated on every page. The characters are diverse, not only in terms of social class but also their mannerisms and quirks, as if they were truly alive. I could definitely see this on the big (or little) screen - it's crying out for adaptation.The murder mystery itself is only one thread within the multi-layered plot. This is a book about life, change and social etiquette. It's gripping, mesmerising and intriguing from beginning to end. I look forward to more books from Rachel Rhys.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher."},
{"title": "Swimming Lessons by Claire Fuller", "date": "Wednesday 7 June 2017", "text": "Swimming LessonsBy Claire FullerPublished by Fig Tree (26 January 2017)Publisher's description'Gil Coleman looked down from the window and saw his deadwife standing on the pavement below.'Gil's wife, Ingrid has been missing, presumed drowned, fortwelve years. A possible sighting brings their children, Nan and Flora,home. Together they begin to confront the mystery of their mother. Is Ingriddead? Or did she leave? And do the letters hidden within Gil's books hold theanswer to the truth behind his marriage, a truth hidden from everyone includinghis own children? My verdictSwimming Lessons is an ideal book club read, an emotional tale about love and loss that will certainly prompt discussion.This slow burner is the story of an unconventional marriage between ageing author Gil and his wife Ingrid, who vanished one day, leaving Gil to bring up their two daughters alone. Twelve years on, the family is still in crisis, none of them knowing what happened to their wife and mother. Gil finds hidden letters written by Ingrid, each one revealing her insights into their lives, from their first meeting to just before she disappeared.Claire Fuller writes with impeccable detail about the little things most people don't even notice yet bring people and places to life. Her evocative prose is stunning and easy to read, with plenty of charm, touching on thought-provoking issues. I can't say I found the characters particularly likeable, but they were definitely believable. I found Ingrid to be the most well drawn character of all, as the sadness in her heart is revealed through her writing - a life full of love, hopes and dreams, but also regrets.Cleverly, the title of the books in which the letters are hidden give a subtle hint about the contents of each letter. Swimming Lessons has certainly been planned, plotted and executed with precision.I received an Advance Reader Copy, but also bought my own copy of the book."},

Exquisite is being published by Orenda Books on 15 June 2017.ExquisiteBy Sarah StovellPublished by Orenda Books (15 June 2017)Publisher's descriptionBo Luxton has it all - aloving family, a beautiful home in the Lake District, and a clutch ofbestselling books to her name. Enter Alice Dark, an aspiring writer who isdrifting through life, with a series of dead-end jobs and a freeloadingboyfriend. When they meet at a writers' retreat, the chemistry is instant, anda sinister relationship develops ... Or does it? My verdictThe writing in Exquisite is truly ... stunning. Yes, I'm going to try to review it without mentioning the title (well maybe once).The instant they meet, Alice and Bo feel a spark ignite between them. Bo is an established author. Alice is a young writer who joins one of Bo's writing retreats. Unable to keep their distance, their friendship evolves into a dangerous, sexy, passionate, powerful and intense relationship, spiralling behind their control.Beautifully written prose put me right inside the heads of these two unreliable narrators, experiencing all of their thoughts and feelings. Their passions. Their fears. Their worries. Their hopes for the future. There was an underlying current of unease. And the tension gradually escalated until these two intelligent women became pitted against one another, with more than a hint of Fatal Attraction (without the bunny boiling). I found it very difficult to know who to believe, who was telling the truth and who was telling lies (although I did have my suspicions, which turned out to be correct). And as for that ending .... Ooh, it got me thinking, and the unease started all over again.Everyone will be calling this book 'exquisite'. It's a perfect title. But if anyone thinks that's too cliched, here are a few of the other words and phrases that came to mind as I read it  - stunning, gorgeous, expertly crafted, superb, magnificent, breathtaking, breath-holding, skin-tingling, and highly memorable. Some of the best writing I've read all year.An unforgettable, outstanding book that should be on everyone's 'to buy' list!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Follow the Blog Tour"},

{"title": "The Fireman by Joe Hill", "date": "Thursday 25 May 2017", "text": "The FiremanBy Joe HillPublished by GollanczPaperback - 19 January 2017Publisher's descriptionNobody knewwhere the virus came from. FOX News said it had been set loose by ISIS, usingspores that had been invented by the Russians in the 1980s. MSNBC said sourcesindicated it might've been created by engineers at Halliburton and stolen byculty Christian types fixated on the Book of Revelation. CNN reported bothsides. And while every TV station debated the cause, the world burnt. Pregnant school nurse, HARPER GRAYSON, has seen lots of people burn on TV, butthe first person she saw burn for real was in the playground behind her school.But when she realises she has become infected, she is determined to find a wayto survive - at least long enough to see her child born. No matter what is leftof the world for them to live in.My verdictJoe Hill is certainly a talented writer with plenty of imagination - not surprising when you realise his father is Stephen King.The Fireman features great writing, sharp dialogue and a complex page-turning plot. A powerful fungal infection, causing people to burst into flames, is devastating the world. At the heart of the story is Harper Grayson, a pregnant nurse who is now infected and wants to keep living for the sake of her unborn child.The book is a mix of horror, action, science fiction, dystopian thriller, mystery and romance, with more than a hint of zombie fiction (although the infected retain their sense of self). The author has put ordinary people in an extraordinary situation - and you, as the reader, see how they survive, cope and pull together as the world burns around them.At 765 pages, The Fireman isn't a quick read - and it's also heavy in your hands. I did feel that there was some 'overwriting' here, slowing down the pace at times - some of the background narrative and irrelevant conversations could have been cut. I guessed certain twists too, although this didn't detract from my enjoyment.Overall though, the book is emotionally charged, action-packed and filled with depth. There are many themes running through it, including hope, acceptance, fear, shame, love and a sense of belonging. Highly enjoyable - just make sure you give yourself plenty of reading time for this epic journey.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Lovereading."},

But I actually enjoyed it more this time as it was easier to relax and chat to everyone there. Lovely to spend time with authors, publishers/editors and bloggers/reviewers in the bar and lounge and outside the panel rooms. I even chatted with an agent for a while. Great fun too, especially group selfies and toffee vodka at 2am! Only a few photos of me though, as I try to avoid them!Goodie bagsBrilliant CrimeFest bags this year, with Orenda Books featuring on the other side. Three books in each bag. I decided I didn't want one of them (and no, I'm not saying which book), so I left it on the 'swapsies' table. Since I have 'just a few' books to read, I decided not to replace it. Lots of promotional leaflets, postcards and bookmarks to pick up too. These are the two books I kept - The Night Stalker by Clare Donoghue and The Black Sheep by Sophie McKenzie.Ragnar Jonasson bookmarks handed to me by Orenda Books (ignore the terrible photo). Some are now on their way to fellow blogger Kate Moloney (Bibliophile Book Club) in Ireland!Books to buyThe CrimeFest book shop was well stocked, and there was an opportunity after each panel to queue up for authors to sign purchased books. I decided this year to be strict with myself, as I couldn't carry many books home. But I have come away with a long list of books to buy. I did buy Simon Toyne's The Boy Who Saw, as I loved Solomon Creed, the first in the series. Plus Into The Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes. This is one of my favourite psychological thrillers and until CrimeFest I only had the e-book. Great to see both Simon & Elizabeth again.One of my most memorable (but not necessarily enjoyable) experiences of CrimeFest 2017 was being stuck in a broken down lift for around 10 minutes with Joy Kluver and an author who needed to get to her panel! Both were great company though, and none of us panicked! I'm not claustrophobic, but it did take all of us a few hours to pluck up enough courage to get back into a lift (especially on our own)!CrimeFest was a fantastic weekend - costly, yes, but I believe it was well worth the money. You can reduce the cost if you don't stay at the Marriott Hotel. Hope to see some of you there next year! Visit the CrimeFest website here to learn more about the weekend and see updates about the 2018 festival."},

AUTHORSJohn LeCarre – his books are beautifully written and have page-turning plots, complexcharacters and wonderful subtlety. I love ‘The Spy Who Came In From The Cold’and ‘Smiley’s People’ but my all-time favourite book is ‘Tinker Tailor SoldierSpy’, which manages to be a mystery, a whodunit, a thriller, a socialcommentary and a devastating account of the cost of betrayal all at once. It’sa marvelous book. ... FILMS/MOVIESTheGodfather – though don’t ask me to choose between parts one and two as they areboth sublime. Michael Corleone’s journey; from the young guy who doesn’t wantanything to do with the family business to mafia king pin who loses his soul,is so watchable I can never turn it off if it’s on late night TV, despite owningthe DVD. It’s one to watch over and over again. Great acting, wonderful writingand superb lines abound. I can probably recite every one of them. ... TV DRAMASBand ofBrothers or Our Friends in the North, though my guilty pleasure is Game ofThrones. Band of Brothers is the best and most realistic portrayal of war Ihave ever seen. Our Friends In The North is a moving journey through threedecades of north east politics, crime and enduring friendships. The three mainactors, unknown at the time, went on to play James Bond (Daniel Craig), Dr Who(Christopher Eccleston) and, in the case of Mark Strong, just about everyHollywood villain of the past decade. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibalLecter. I’ve yet to come across a scarier human being in any book or film; aman who will happily slaughter and eat you then wash you down with a niceChianti. “I do wish we could chat longer but I’m having an old friend fordinner.” ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESSaga Norenfrom the Bridge, as played by Sofia Helin, because she is eye-rollinglybonkers. Not sure how someone so ‘out there’ could actually function as apolice officer but her social alienation makes for excellent drama and veryoften great comedy, particularly when she comes out with something wildlyinappropriate, which she so often does ... MURDER WEAPONSI instantlythought of the oar that Tom Ripley uses to beat Dickie Greenleaf to death in aboat in ‘The Talented Mr Ripley’. It’s a shocking episode from a dark bookabout an immoral man and great storytelling.... DEATH SCENESWhenMichael Corleone confronts his brother in law Carlo Rizzi in the Godfather, becausehe was responsible for his brother Sonny’s death, Carlo fears the worst. That’suntil the new godfather convinces him he would never kill his sister’s husbandand his actual punishment is exclusion from the family business. He even givesthe man a plane ticket and they put his suitcase in the boot for him. ThenCarlo gets into the car to find gangster Pete Clemenza in the back seat waitingfor him. ‘Hello Carlo’ he says before efficiently garroting the traitor, as thecar slowly drives away, watched by a vengeful Michael and his Consigliere.Carlo’s foot goes through the front windscreen too and as it twitches that’sall we see of his final death throes.        ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI go onNUFC.COM every day, which is a great site for long suffering Newcastle Unitedfans. What has it got to do with crime writing? Not much at first glance but mycharacters often have the surnames of obscure but popular Newcastle players.It’s an in-joke that only Newcastle fans will get. I love this site so muchthat every year we do a competition giveaway on it when my books are publishedand it gets a great response. ... WRITING TIPSBe your ownworst critic during editing before you send anything in and keep going.Momentum is what’s needed to complete a book, so a few hundred words a day mostdays will get you there in the end. ... WRITING SNACKSIs wine a snack? I think it should be. I’m a terrible grazerso I try to avoid actual snacks while writing, otherwise I’d be huge. I’ll saycoffee instead then, which is writer’s fuel as everybody knows.About HOWARD LINSKEYHoward Linskey is the author of three novels in the DavidBlake crime series publishedby No Exit Press, The Drop (2011), TheDamage (2012) and TheDead (2013).

{"title": "Reconciliation for the Dead by Paul Hardisty - Blog Tour", "date": "Tuesday 16 May 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Reconciliation for the Dead by Paul Hardisty. Reconciliation for the Dead is being published by Orenda Books on 30 May 2017. Read on for my review ...Reconciliation for the DeadBy Paul HardistyPublished by Orenda Books (30 May 2017)Publisher's descriptionFresh fromevents in Yemen and Cyprus, vigilante justice-seeker Claymore Straker returnsto South Africa, seeking absolution for the sins of his past. Over four days,he testifies to Desmond Tutu’s newly established Truth and ReconciliationCommission, recounting the shattering events that led to his dishonourabledischarge and exile, fifteen years earlier. It was 1980. The height of the ColdWar. Clay is a young paratrooper in the South African Army, fighting in Angolaagainst the Communist insurgency that threatens to topple the White Apartheidregime. On a patrol deep inside Angola, Clay, and his best friend, EbenBarstow, find themselves enmeshed in a tangled conspiracy that threatenseverything they have been taught to believe about war, and the sacrifices thatthey, and their brothers in arms, are expected to make. Witness and unwittingaccomplice to an act of shocking brutality, Clay changes allegiance and findshimself labelled a deserter and accused of high treason, setting him on ajourney into the dark, twisted heart of institutionalised hatred, from which noone will emerge unscathed.My verdictFor me, Reconciliation for the Dead was a tough read. Not in terms of the writing - that's perfect, fast paced and totally mesmerising, putting the reader right into the heart of its South African setting. But I found it tough in terms of the subject matter and emotional undercurrent - the horror and realism of war, death and corruption in 1980s South Africa, when men in the position of authority were governed by greed and deceit.I've read the two previous Claymore Striker books and loved both of them. Reconciliation for the Dead is a very different read, concentrating mainly on the past, rather than the 'here and now'. Clay is recounting events that led to his dishonourable army discharge and exile fifteen years earlier, while appearing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. These events are traumatic, personal and horrific, responsible for shaping Clay's character in this series. On reading this, the previous books seemed to make more sense to me. Yet I'm sure this book could also be read as a standalone.I believe this is Paul Hardisty's best book so far (I'm hoping there are many more to come). He took me on an emotional rollercoaster ride, swinging between fear and anger, hope and despair, even more so than with his two previous books, which are also powerful and moving. Based on fact, this page-turning book is a perfect mixture of crime, thriller, politics, social history and science, opening up my eyes to a country whose past I know little about.Reconciliation for the Dead is different from the norm, and I can't praise it highly enough.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Usually you do it without even realizing it. At the endof the day, everything from your shoe-size to your credit limit is out there.Your greatest joys, your darkest moments. Your deepest secrets.If someonewants to know everything about you, all they have to do is look.But whathappens when someone starts spilling state secrets? For politician BethanyLeherer and programmer Danielle Farr, that's not just an interestingthought-experiment. An online celebrity called sic_girl has started telling theworld too much about Bethany and Dani, from their jobs and lives to their mostintimate secrets. There's just one problem: sic_girl doesn't exist. She's anconstruct, a program used to test code. Now Dani and Bethany must race againstthe clock to find out who's controlling sic_girl and why... before she destroysthe privacy of everyone in the UK.My verdictSockpuppet is an impressive thought-provoking debut.This modern day whodunnit is based around a fictional social media platform called Parley (which I assumed is similar to Twitter). State secrets, and personal secrets, are being deliberately revealed by an online bot called sic_girl. It's clear that someone is on a mission to create havoc, but who and why?Matt Blakstad has created a page-turning dark conspiracy thriller, based on acute observations of a digital society governed by online activity, political ambition and instant communication. There's plenty of computer jargon (and I have to admit it took me a while to get my head round some of it), making this a perfect thriller for computer geeks!The plot is fast paced, ambitious and multilayered, with various complex underlying themes. But ultimately, reading Sockpuppet taught me two important things ...1. Whatever you do online, remember that somewhere, or rather everywhere, someone is watching your every move.2. Always check, double-check and triple-check the terms and conditions before you proceed with ANYTHING!The recent & possibly ongoing NHS malware attack proves how relevant Sockpuppet is to modern society - this thriller is a warning to us all.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher."},
{"title": "Living with an invisible illness", "date": "Friday 12 May 2017", "text": "Something a bit different on my blog today. I don't usually post anything personal on here or on social media. But today is International Fibromyalgia Awareness Day. And while I don't often talk about it, this week I've been struggling with symptoms. So here's a slightly adapted speech I gave on the subject of chronic pain a few years ago.  Four yearsago, I was asked to speak to some local women under the broad heading of the‘challenge of being me’. I had no idea what to talk about. I work as a healthjournalist, have two growing boys and run a home. But this is no different to1000s of other women aged 40-something around the country.Then myhusband suggested that I talk about what it's like to have a medical conditionthat no-one actually notices, yet is always there in the background. Maybe, hesuggested, I could raise the awareness of chronic pain conditions. In the UK,pain is one of the most common reasons why people seek medical treatment. It’sconsidered to be chronic, long term, if it lasts for longer than 12 weeks. It’sestimated that people who have chronic pain consult their GP up to five timesmore often than those without it. According to the British Pain Society, around10 million people in Britain suffer pain almost daily, resulting in a majorimpact on their quality of life and days off work.Arthritis,one of the most common causes of chronic pain, affects one in six of the UKpopulation. But according to the charity Arthritis Care, the knowledge of thecondition is very low. There’s a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation,and most people think there's nothing they can do about it and that it'sinevitable. When Ioriginally wrote this speech, it happened to be Arthritis Care Week, with thetheme that 'something can always be done'. The charity had been asking peoplewhat their 'something' was - the first step that got them started in trying tomanage their arthritis, rather than letting it manage them.I havefibromyalgia. This poorly understood chronic condition is often grouped underthe heading of arthritis, although now doctors believe that it is caused by aproblem with the nervous system rather than the joints and muscles. Morerecently, research has looked into the role of blood vessels too. Likearthritis though, fibromyalgia can affect the joints and causes chronic pain. Every year,May 12th is designated International Fibromyalgia Awareness Day. This date waschosen because it is Florence Nightingale's birthday. It has been widelydocumented that she suffered from a fibromyalgia-like illness for over 50years, leaving her bedridden with chronic pain and fatigue. This was probablytriggered by a bacterial infection caught in the Crimean War. Accordingto the Oxford English Dictionary, a challenge is 'a task or situation thattests someone's abilities'. Fibromyalgia certainly fits the bill. It impacts onmy life every day, sometimes all day, affecting how I feel and the decisions Imake. But the question I have been asking myself over the last week is do I seeit as a challenge that I have to overcome?To give yousome background, fibromyalgia is estimated to affect around one in 20 peopleworldwide, yet many people have never heard of it. There's no specific test andthe only way to diagnose it is to rule out everything else first, such asthyroid disease, multiple sclerosis and arthritis. Fibro, togive it its shorter name, causes a whole host of different symptoms, impactingon every part of the body. But some of the main symptoms are widespread painand stiffness, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome and poor or unrefreshed sleep.The pain can vary from aching, to a burning or bruised sensation to stabbingpains and can occur anywhere in the body. No-onefully understands the cause of fibro, although there seems to be a problem withthe way that pain messages are carried and received around the body, alongsidelow levels of certain chemicals and hormones in the brain and disturbed sleeppatterns. People with fibro are very sensitive to pain messages, so weexperience the pain due to, say, a simple bump on the arm more severely and forlonger than other people would do.In manypeople, fibro has a specific trigger - an infection or a physical or emotionaltrauma. Mine was a throat infection at the age of 13, which triggered my immunesystem to attack my joints, leading to reactive arthritis. For six to ninemonths, I had the body of a 90 year old. I found it hard to walk, write and dosimple daily tasks. I took a lot of time off school and couldn't take part inPE lessons or join in with certain activities. When the symptoms finallycleared up, the consultant warned me that I could experience problems later inlife, particularly whenever I had a viral infection or was feeling run down. When I was18, while at university and back to leading a normal active life, playingtennis every day, I went back to the same consultant with pain in my neck,shoulders and back, and a bruised feeling in my legs. He diagnosedfibromyalgia. But at the time my symptoms were so mild that I didn't thinkabout thelong-term impact.Nearly 10years ago, this all changed. Following my first and only flu jab and astressful few months with building work at home, I developed pain all over(especially in my joints), dizziness and severe fatigue. The only abnormalitythat came up in the investigations was vitamin D deficiency, which can causesimilar symptoms but can also be triggered by chronic pain.Therheumatologist I saw didn't know much about fibromyalgia, and it was only twoyears later that I realised this was a severe flare up, possibly triggered bythe flu jab. I notice now that whenever I get an infection, my fibro symptomsget worse. Over thelast few years, my symptoms have become more pronounced. I get at least oneflare up for a few days each month. A flare up is like having a bad case of flu- fatigue (being so tired I can't lift up my arms), feeling dizzy or 'seasick', experiencing pain all over and a raised body temperature. Even on a goodday, I can feel a little heady and tired (although not fatigued) and experiencepain somewhere. I’ve since been diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis as well, allstemming back to the original viral infection I had at the age of 13.So do I seemy fibro as a challenge? Yes I guess I do, but no more of a challenge than anyother chronic pain condition. People with chronic pain often look completelyfine on the outside but inside it can be a whole different story.Unfortunately, we are the only ones who know how we are feeling and sometimesit is difficult to put this into words.Fibro isn'tlife threatening and shouldn't get progressively worse, although it flares upand down and each flare up varies in severity. My fibro affects many aspects ofmy life. For example, I can't sit or stand in one position for long periods asmy joints are too stiff; some days, I stay indoors as much as possible, as wetor cold weather makes my symptoms worse. And I try not to drive too late atnight, as this is when I am most likely to experience the fatigue anddizziness. Late nights and loud music can trigger a flare up too.I feel thatthe biggest challenge is that there’s no specific treatment for fibro, and thatmost GPs don't know much about the condition. The prescribed treatments thatare available aren't always effective and, in many cases, the side effects canbe worse than the symptoms themselves - especially for people like me, whosesymptoms are mild to moderate rather than severe. Many people do find themedicines very effective and significantly improve their quality of life. But Ihave chosen not to take any prescribed medications for as long as I can stillmanage without them. I cope by taking over the counter medicines to relieve mysymptoms. I also take vitamin D supplements every day to keep my levels up.Whilewriting an article on pain management, I discovered that at any one time aroundone million people in the UK are suffering from pain that could besignificantly better treated. This doesn't just mean being given more effectivemedicines, but also receiving more information about coping strategies andcomplementary therapies. The National Pain Audit by the British Pain Society inJanuary 2013 found that NHS pain clinics make a significant difference topeople's lives, yet many patients don't have access to adequate services orthey face long waiting lists.I saw afibro consultant eight years ago. He commented that with my job and my twoboys, I am doing incredibly well. I wasn't quite sure what he meant by this,until I realised that many of his patients are housebound or in too much painto work. He told me to come back to him if I get to the stage when I feel I canno longer cope. But all he offered me was strong medication, rather thanpractical measures and advice. Needless to say, I never went back.A few yearsago, I took part in Cancer Research UK's Race for Life. Reading the stories ofsome of the women walking and running that day, and seeing thenames offamily members and friends written on their backs, made me realise that lifereally is too short to let it pass by. There are a lot of people with far worseconditions than me, some life-threatening, some progressive, some a mixture ofthe two. Since then I’ve lost close friends and relatives to cancer and otherillnesses too.Accordingto deaf and blind American writer Helen Keller, writing in 1957, 'Life iseither a daring adventure or nothing.'Well Ichoose the daring adventure. I have had fibromyalgia and chronic pain foralmost as long as I can remember. But it shouldn't define me and it shouldn'tcontrol me. The key tofibro management, and any chronic pain condition, is pacing yourself, whichmeans not overdoing it or pushing yourself beyond your limits. But doing enoughto keep going.I amfortunate enough to work from home. I have several deadlines each month, butcan plan my own hours. I get more work done on some days than on others, but itall gets done in the end and between flare ups I can do extra work in theevenings if I need to. I’m also reading/reviewing books and writing fiction –this tends to be late in the evenings and I often don’t sleep well.I admitthat sometimes I shout at my boys a bit too much when I need to get dinnerready or chauffeur them around, because all I really want to do is rest. But Iknow I can't, because I have too much to do. And I won't, out of principle.Admittedly though, I probably don't rest enough.So if yousee me and think I’m a bit quiet or aloof, or I seem a bit tired or anxious, it may be because I feel painsomewhere, my head is spinning or I feel a bit run down. Whileresearching this, I found the following quote. 'Life's challenges are notsupposed to paralyse you; they're supposed to help you discover who youare.\" This was written by Bernice Johnson Reagon, an Americansinger-songwriter and human rights activist.So who amI? I am a health journalist and a mother of two. I love reading and reviewing. I'm also writing crime fiction in the hope that one day I'll achieve my dream of being a published novelist. And oh, yes, I also happen to have fibromyalgia. Now, goingback to Arthritis Care's question four years’ ago - what was my 'something'?What was the first step that got me started in trying to manage my symptoms? Myanswer is that I have finally learnt to rule my fibromyalgia, rather than letchronic pain rule me."},

AUTHORSPatriciaHighsmith for, among other works, TheTalented Mr Ripley because I love an amoral protagonist and her writing isbrilliant. ... FILMS/MOVIESAlwaysenjoy a good British crime film so depending on my mood, my favourite is The Long Good Friday with Bob Hoskins or10 Rillington Place with RichardAttenborough playing the serial killer John Christie. Both actors givefascinating portrayals of evil. ... TV DRAMASSo manybrilliant dramas to choose from! I am glad the third series of Broadchurch made up for the blip of itspredecessor but for real OMG moments it has to be Line of Duty. I love the way characters you thought were going tobe essential to the narrative are killed off in such dramatic ways and I don’tmind having to suspend disbelief at times when the acting is pitch perfect.However Happy Valley and the Unforgotten take the accolade for theirsuperlative female leads. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSWithoutdoubt Hannibal Lecter. His character in Silenceof the Lambs is bad enough but just reading the sequel, which is amasterpiece in understatement, gave me horrific nightmares. I had to stopreading it at nighttime. I don’t think any other killer has terrified me more. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESHas to bemy beloved Morse. When Colin Dexter died in March I reread The Remorseful Day. Sublime. ... MURDER WEAPONSI had tothink about this and the following question. I like the idea of some mundaneeveryday item put to grisly use. However water is one which holds the mostterror for me. Just the thought of being held under water…     ... DEATH SCENESThis is abit of a cheat really – not a death scene but a transformation in The Witches by Roald Dahl. When theGrand High Witch administers a potion that turns the young boy narrator into arat, there is no antidote and the rest of his life (presumably much shorterthank a human one) must be lived out as a rodent. ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI useGoogle images a lot. In Death’s SilentJudgement I found pictures of the Bull Ring at Waterloo, which housedCardboard City. I used to walk through there years ago but didn’t have theforesight to take my own photos then. I check out popular names for the year acharacter was born in on the Office for National Statistics and Google datesthen follow links to newspaper articles if I’m searching for somethingspecific. ... WRITING TIPSGet wordson the page. It helps me to strive for a daily word count that is achievablethen anything more is pure bonus. My first drafts are like a skeleton that’sbeen assembled in a dark room – an arm where a leg should be, toes coming outof the skull and so on. But at least I have something to work with. Don’t beintimidated by what other writers say or do. Follow your own path and alsoread, read, read and not just crime books. And try not to compare yourself withwhat other people are doing/achieving.

So when Elka seesthe Wanted poster in town, her simple existence is shattered. Her Trapper –Kreagar Hallet – is wanted for murder. Even worse, Magistrate Lyon is hot onhis trail, and she wants to talk to Elka.As wintersets in, Elka flees into the vast wilderness, determined to find her realparents. But Lyon is never far behind, and she’s not the only one followingElka’s every move. Soon Elka must confront the darkest memories of her past-and end Trapper’s killing spree for good.My verdictThe Wolf Road totally 'wowed' me, and not many books do that. It's intelligent and unique and filled with raw emotion.Set in a post-apocalyptic Canada, after what seems to be a nuclear war, it's about a girl's epic journey searching for her parents, who abandoned her as a young child. While this is a dystopian novel, it also has a 'Western' feel to it and reads as a thriller in places too, with a mystery at its heart. Definitely a 'cross-genre' book.The story is narrated in the first person, through the eyes of Elka - in her own language, her own voice, all of her thoughts, feelings and emotions spilling onto the page. A man (Trapper) rescued her after her grandmother died. He taught her how to hunt and survive in the harsh climate and stark surroundings, yet he never became a father to her, remaining distant and aloof over the years. When she discovers something terrible about him, she runs away, realising that maybe Trapper, and their life together, wasn't what it seemed.The Wolf Road is about Elka discovering who she is and what she believes in and trying to make sense of her past and present. It's very dark, although there are some lighter moments. The writing is beautiful, with highly vivid descriptions of the wilds. This is a fight for survival in a place where food is scarce and danger lurks around each corner.The Wolf Road is a book that will linger with you for days after finishing it - simply stunning!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Lovereading."},

There are three things you should know about me.1. I’min a coma2. Myhusband doesn’t love me any more3.Sometimes I lieMy verdictSometimes I Lie is a well written, highly unsettling read.At first, the book seemed to be a standard psychological thriller with yet another coma victim. And it took a little while to get going. But then the chills and intrigue set in as I delved further into the story. And eventually I couldn't put the book down.Amber is stuck a coma. She's aware of her surroundings and knows she's been in accident, but can't remember much more than this. We hear her thoughts, as family and friends visit her in hospital and she tries to put the pieces of her shattered memory back together.The narrative was compelling and gripping, with a totally unreliable narrator. I wasn't sure who to trust, what was real and what wasn't, how much was truth and how much was lies. The book is very cleverly plotted, unravelling layer by layer until the bitter end, with a fantastic twist.Sometimes I Lie is definitely a book intended to baffle the reader. And it certainly did in my case. It's unpredictable, with plenty of shocks and surprises. Highly recommended!I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

AUTHORSSylviaPlath may be a surprising choice for a thriller writer, but she has a flawlesssense of voice. I love how talky and confiding her different narrators are. Sheis powerful about obsessions of all kinds, always with the perfect marriage ofform and content. I was thinking of the oo oo oo rhymes in her famous poem‘Daddy’ when I wrote the opening lines of my first novel, The Book of You. It really helped.... FILMS/MOVIESRear Window is a film that has always stayed with me. Iadmire the way Hitchcock blends crime/thriller with a serious study of men andwomen at different stages of their relationships. There is always somethinginteresting happening if you look where you aren’t meant to – little hiddentreats – and I notice something new with each viewing. The scene where GraceKelly goes into the murderer’s flat – watched helplessly by wheelchair-bound JamesStewart from his window across the courtyard – is unbearably tense. (And I loveGrace Kelly’s dresses.)... TV DRAMASThe BBC adaptationof Wolf Hall brought to life all the complexitiesof the novels. I couldn’t look away from Mark Rylance’s Cromwell, his quiet watchfulness,his wit, and his sadness too. I was reluctantly charmed – as well as terrified– by Damian Lewis as Henry VIII. But I especially couldn’t take my eyes offClaire Foy as Anne Boleyn. We all know how it ends, but I still wept for her.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSPatriciaHighsmith’s Tom Ripley has always been one of my favourite characters. When Iread, I am both horrified by him and in terror of his getting caught. I think Ripleywould be amazing fun to know (as long as he didn’t want you dead). ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESMichaelConnelly’s Harry Bosch reminds me of my father, with his knowledge of LosAngeles  restaurants and certainty aboutwhat he wants to eat in each of them. Harry and my father frequent the sameplaces. Bosch’s love of the city, and his sense of the old Los Angeles as anever-present ghost beneath the new, is like my father’s too. ...

{"title": "Top 10 Tips on Writing Crime Fiction from Mark Billingham", "date": "Sunday 7 May 2017", "text": "On the evening of 5th April 2017, I attended the Writers' & Artists' ‘How to Write Crime Fiction’ masterclass, with top crime authorMark Billingham. It was a fantastic introduction to writing crime fiction –talking rules and when to break them. I wrote the following blog post for the Writers' & Artists' website (click here).Here are 10 top tips I learnt from Mark1. Write the book you want to readDon’t look for gaps in the market.  Write about what interests you as a reader – this is likelyto interest other people too. 2. Choose a strong openingYou need to hook the reader quickly and early. You have 15seconds in a bookshop to ‘sell’ your book through the cover, blurb and first fewparagraphs. Lure the reader in with a killer sentence or anything that asks aquestion. This is essential if you’re submitting a manuscript to an agent orpublisher, as it’s all you’ve got. 3. Decide on your point of view (POV)You may find you write more quickly and easily in firstperson. But the protagonist has to be present in every scene and can’t knowwhat anyone else is thinking. Your character also needs to be interesting aseverything is filtered through their worldview. Their thoughts need to beentertaining to keep your readers engaged. Second person – ‘you’ is rarely used.Third person has more scope and is most commonly used incrime fiction. But the POV must be consistent – no head hopping within a sceneor chapter. Chapters can switch between viewpoints or some may be written inthe first person to get inside the killer’s head. 4. Find your own wayDecide whether, and how much, you want to plot in advance. Dowhat’s right for you.Mark takes the ‘driving at night’ approach to writing. Heknows where he’s going, but can only see as far as the headlights. The journeyopens up bit by bit and sometimes he comes to dead ends and brick walls. He’llhave an idea of what’s going to happen 40 or so chapters ahead. But, he says, surprisingyourself as you write is part of the fun.5. Don’t get bogged down by researchDo your research after you’ve written your story. Thenyou’ll know what you need to know. Crime readers can be savvy about procedure,such as DNA and fingerprints, so don’t take liberties.Visit locations if you can, simply to get a feel of a place– what they smell like, what they look like. You can’t get all of that onGoogle Maps.Illnesses and addictions affect a lot of people so it’s goodto have a proper insight, and people are usually happy to talk. If you’retalking to coppers, listen to their anecdotes and banter. 6.  Dialogue iseverythingGreat writers can do everything through dialogue, conveyinginformation and character traits. So if you’re good at writing dialogue, use ita lot. You can even write whole scenes in dialogue if this works for you. Rememberthough, dialogue looks different on a screen to how it sounds. So read it outloud. If you hear clunky lines, lose them. Character and realism in dialogue is more important thatliterary eloquence. But unnecessary dialogue can be tedious so ditch the smalltalk. And remember that naturalistic dialogue isn’t always readable, so you mayhave to adapt it.7. Be disciplinedEvery writer has their own routine. Some have no routine atall. It’s important to keep writing – 5000 words a week is a good target, butit’s not set in stone. Some days will be less productive than others. If you’restruggling to write more of your story one day, write something else for awhile. 8. Less is moreNudge the reader’s imagination. A single drop of blood on apristine kitchen floor can be far more powerful than a graphic murder scene. If you’re good at describing landscapes, describe them. Butdon’t paint the whole picture. Readers also don’t need to know everything aboutyour characters’ clothes, hair or mannerisms. 9. When you’re done, rewriteSome people write from beginning to end and then go back tothe beginning and do the rewrites. Others can’t write chapter 2 unless they’vefinished with chapter 1. Rewriting is generally taking stuff away, but not always. Ifit sounds like writing, rewrite it. Leave out the boring parts readers tend toskip. At some point you’ll need to hand your manuscript over to areader for their opinion. Make sure it’s someone you trust but someone who’llbe honest too. If they’re telling you something’s not right, it’s oftenconfirming what you already know. 10. Finish things – and start againThis is what makes you into a writer – you finish whatyou’ve started. Don’t give up halfway through. As a writer, you’ll do a lot of waiting – for agents,publishers, edits… – so always be thinking about your next book. Obviously rules are made to be broken - so you may wish to adapt some to suit your own writing!Huge thanks to Mark Billingham for his advice, and to Writers & Artists for putting on such a brilliant evening - not just informative but great value too. And, finally, a big thank you to Susi Holliday, another fab crime writer who told me about the masterclass in the first place!"},

AUTHORSI grew upreading Agatha Christie as I’m suredid many other crime writers and I am still awed by her plotting skills, herability to build suspense and her ingenuity. I have rarely been able to guess the ending of an Agatha Christie novel.  Of themore recent crime novelists, my favourite has to be Jo Nesbo as his novels are such page-turners and, for me, a greatcrime novel is one that you just can’t put down.  His plots are fabulous, his charactersfantastically well drawn and he has an enviable ability to generate fear.  I remember reading The Snowman, while alone in the house and literally being toofrightened to move from the sofa until my husband got back from his night outat about 1 a.m.! ... FILMS/MOVIESThe filmthat has disturbed my psyche for the longest has to be Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. One night my sister, who was supposed to be babysitting me, put it onwhen her boyfriend came around and I watched it, terrified, from behind a sofacushion.  I must have been about twelveand she was fifteen.  I wouldn’t showerwith the curtain closed for literally twenty-years after seeing that film.  It is the ultimate psychological chiller.   ... TV DRAMASMyfavourite TV crime dramas of recent years have been the Scandi dramas, The Bridge and The Killing.  The plots arefabulous, but the thing that really hooked me with both series were thecharacters, which had incredible depth and were so well drawn.I willhappily while away a couple of hours watching Silent Witness as it always has good plots.  I also love stand alone psychological crimedramas such as the recent, TheReplacement, which was gripping, except for the ending which was bizarreand rather unsatisfying.  A good crimenovel or series must have a good ending, otherwise it feels like an anti-climax. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSMy topfictional killer has four legs.  I usedto read a lot of Arthur Conan Doyle’s,Sherlock Holmes when I wasgrowing up and The Hound of theBaskervilles was the killer I found by far the most frightening andmemorable.   ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESWomen are often portrayed as victims in crime literature andso I love StiegLarsson’s Lisbeth Salander,because she is such a kick-arse woman. When I came to create my series character, Jessie Flynn, I also wantedto create a character who celebrates the huge number of strong, funny, clever,independent women that I know. ... MURDER WEAPONSI have always been fascinated by the ‘whys’ of humanbehaviour – what motivates people to behave as they do – and the psychological motivationsfor murder interest me far more than the mechanics of the actual murder.  Having said that, I think that being buriedalive must be a truly horrid way to die. Offhand, I can’t think of a novelist who has used this method, but I’msure that a few have.     ... DEATH SCENESBeing apsychologist, my preferred death scene would be for someone to be so tormentedthat they commit suicide.    ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI try toavoid the Internet as much as possible when I’m writing as surfing seems to Hooverup time like no other activity!  I havethree young children, so I tend to use every spare minute that they’re atschool to write.  When I have time off, Ilike to spend it outside, walking the dogs, gardening, cycling or just enjoyingnature.   ... WRITING TIPSTime spentplotting is never wasted.  I am an avidplotter and will spend a good two or three months plotting my novels andfleshing out the characters in great detail before I write a word, and so mytop tip for anyone who is interested in writing a crime novel is to spend qualitytime plotting.  An intricately carved,twisty-turny story that keeps me guessing until the end is, for me, a criticalfeature of a great crime novel. ... WRITING SNACKSI have writing drinks rather than writing snacks: full-fatmilk lattes in the morning and Sauvignon Blanc in the evening, neither of whichdo positive things for my waist line.About KATE MEDINAKate Medinahas always been fascinated by the ‘whys’ of human behaviour, an interest thatdrove her to study Psychology at university and later to start a crime seriesfeaturing clinical psychologist, Dr Jessie Flynn.

With her family falling apart and the investigation goingnowhere, Grace's only solace is the re-emergence of Faye, an old friend whoseems to understand her loss.DI WillJackman delves into the case, until a family tragedy and a figure from his pastthreaten to derail him.When thepolice discover another victim, the spotlight falls on Grace. Can Jackman findthe killer, before she is convicted of a crime she didn't commit?My verdictThis is the latest book in Jane Isaac's DI Will Jackman series but could easily be read as a standalone.The book follows the story of Grace Daniels. After her daughter is found dead, Grace's life begins to fall apart. Fortunately an old school friend, Faye, is there to help her pick up the pieces and come to terms with her loss. But then Grace becomes the main suspect in the investigation.The Lies Within is part police procedural, part psychological thriller and part emotional family drama - a perfect combination. You know from the prologue that Grace ends up on trial for murder, but most of the book takes place 10 months earlier, when DI Jackman is on a mission to find the real killer before Grace gets convicted. Rather than concentrating solely on Jackman's investigation, the book focuses on Grace's point of view as well, which provides the psychological thriller element.The writing is beautiful and compelling, as are all of Jane Isaac's books. The characters are believable and realistic (I love Jackman in particular!) and the plot is intense, complex and gripping. There are lots of twists, turns and surprises to keep the reader in suspense, and the tension builds up until the final reveal.Jackman isn't your usual crime fiction detective - he has a tragic past but this doesn't detract from the plot at all. Instead, it turns him into a highly likeable well-rounded character with plenty of heart, loyalty and determination.Jane Isaac has become one of my favourite crime fiction authors over the last couple of years, and The Lies Within proves what a versatile writer she is. I believe this is her best book yet. Can't wait to see what's next!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Crime Writing Podcast Special", "date": "Wednesday 3 May 2017", "text": "I have to be honest... Until recently, I'd never listened to a podcast. It had never even crossed my mind to check any out. I had a podcast app on my phone and iPad that had remained unopened. I'd even hidden it from view.So what changed?Firstly, I heard about the Two Crime Writers And A Microphone podcasts, featuring Steve Cavanagh and Luca Veste plus some of their blogger and author pals. And secondly, I read Six Stories by Matt Wesolowski, which is published by Orenda Books. Both opened up my eyes to a whole new world - that of conversation, discussion, learning and enjoyment.I tend to listen to podcasts while I'm doing something mundane like ironing (although I don't do that as often as I should) or driving. Occasionally I listen to them when I'm out for a walk. I need to be able to concentrate so I can't have them on in the background while I'm working, reading or writing.Which podcasts have I been listening to?I've already mentioned Two Crime Writers And a Microphone. I have to admit I'm very behind as each one is around two hours long and I don't always have that time to spare. But they're great fun and definitely worth listening to, tackling topical issues and great discussions. You can find out more here.I've become addicted to The Honest Authors podcast by Gilly McAllister and Holly Seddon. I love these as they're shorter (around 40 to 60 minutes) and the easiest to slot into my day. These offer what they say on the tin. An honest account of what it means to be an author, from the pathway to publication to dealing with edits and publicity. I'm up to date and can't wait for the next one.You can find out more here.I've also started listening to The Bestseller Experiment - with author and screenwriter Mark Stay and 'future author' Mark Delvaux. Their plan is to write and publish a bestseller together within one year. During their writing journey, they speak to authors, publishers and agents about the 'business' of writing bestselling books. I still have a long way to catch upon these podcasts and probably won't have done so by the time the series has finished. You can find out more here.Plus I'm still searching for other podcasts that interest me. So far, I've found a true crime one (Crime Bites) and some other writing ones, including The Creative Penn. The list is endless, although sadly my time isn't.Six Stories by Matt WesolowskiFinally, about Six Stories, which set me on the podcast path. It was published in e-book in December 2016 and in paperback in March 2017. It's since been chosen for the WHSmith Fresh Talent Spring 2017 and I'm sure there are plenty more awards and success stories to come. It's marketed as perfect for fans of 'Serial' - yet another series of podcasts I need to listen to.I was one of the first readers of Six Stories, thanks to the very lovely Karen Sullivan at Orenda Books. I knew straight away that this book would be a success.If you haven't read my full review, you'll find it here. But here's a brief taster:'SixStories isunlike anything else I've read. It's current, fresh and skillfully delivered … An eerie spine-tingling read. It's unpredictable andchilling and kept me guessing all the way through. I don't scare easily, butcertainly found this book unsettling … Everyone will want to read this book -and should!' I bought the audiobook, with its full cast of 17 narrators. Six Stories doesn't just read like a real podcast but it sounds like one too. This book was written to be read out loud!Can you recommend any podcasts?"},

My verdictThe Night Visitor gripped me from the first page. This creepy slow-burning psychological thriller wormed its way right under my skin. Reading it felt like watching a scary film through my fingers, with my hands covering my face. It was unnerving yet addictive, watching the tension build up and the layers peel away.The book is beautifully written, well plotted and well researched. It's filled with suspense, realistic (yet not particularly likeable) characters and so much depth, with references to science, academia and the publishing industry. But it's not just what's on the page that kept me on tenterhooks. It was what's beneath the surface too - reading between the lines, a sense of foreboding throughout and the never-ending feeling of menace and deception.I was worried about how the book would end and where the plot was leading. It's rare for me to desperately want to check the ending of a book early on, just to reassure myself. The Night Visitor certainly had that effect on me.

So she bought me The Mysterious Affair at Styles when I was about seven, eight. Afew days letter, I asked her to take me to the little second hand bookshop whereI used to go with my father on Saturdays, just after school, and I bought a fewmore Agatha Christie and so on until I read them all! ...

{"title": "Block 46 by Johana Gustawsson - republished review", "date": "Sunday 30 April 2017", "text": "Block 46By Johana GustawssonTranslated by Maxim Jakubowski Published by Orenda Books (E-book - out now; Paperback - 15 May 2017)Publisher's descriptionEvil remembers...Falkenberg, Sweden. The mutilated body of talented young jewellery designer, Linnea Blix, is found in a snow-swept marina.Hampstead Heath, London. The body of a young boy is discovered with similar wounds to Linnea's.Buchenwald Concentration Camp, 1944. In the midst of the hell of the Holocaust, Erich Hebner will do anything to see himself as a human again.Are the two murders the work of a serial killer, and how are they connected to shocking events at Buchenwald?Emily Roy, a profiler on loan to Scotland Yard from the Canadian Royal Mounted Police, joins up with Linnea's friend, French truecrime writer Alexis Castells, to investigate the puzzling case. They travel between Sweden and London, and then deep into the past, as a startling and terrifying connection comes to light.My verdictBlock 46 is very 'Orenda Crime', with short chapters, beautiful writing and a compelling fast-paced plot. It's been translated seamlessly from the original French by Maxim Jakubowski. I loved the plot, characters and setting, and I'm not surprised that Block 46 has won awards in France.Shocking and dark from the outset, the book begins with the death of a young jewellery designer who splits her time between London and Sweden. When a young boy's body is discovered with similar wounds, it seems that there is a calculating serial killer on the loose - one whose passion for murder may be linked to the 1940s Buchenwald Concentration Camp in Germany.I was so intrigued to see where Block 46 was going. Yet after just a few pages, I had to put the book down for a while, needing a break. I desperately wanted to read more, but also didn't. Those who know me well will know that books don't often have such an impact on me. And not many books make me email a publisher with the expression 'OMG'!The murder scenes are gruesome - no holds barred - and really get under your skin. But for me, it was the Holocaust scenes that were the most visual and disturbing, with graphic and hard hitting descriptions of tragic scenes that could have, and probably did, happen in Nazi Germany. These scenes may seem exaggerated to some people, but sadly I knew they were realistic, having read many Holocaust books and listened to testimonies of Holocaust survivors.Block 46 contains everything I want in crime fiction, including twists, turns and surprises. It totally broke me for a while at the end and is certainly not a book that I'll forget. I sat thinking about it for a long time afterwards and couldn't pick up another book straight away. I was worried that I would never be able to read again. Sadly I don't tend to read 'light and fluffy' so just had to wait for my reading mojo to return.Perfect for those who like intelligent hard hitting crime with a hint of horror, Block 46 is chilling, creepy and spine tingling. Brilliant! And the best news of all is that it's the start of a series, so there's another one on the way!I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

AUTHORS JefferyDeaver. I’m captivated by the powers of deduction and methods employed by hisLincoln  Rhyme character. It was novels like The Empty Chair that sparked myinterest in contemporary police procedurals and eventually inspired me to writethis genre myself.... FILMS/MOVIESTheTalented Mr Ripley (based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith). It’s unusual fora film to be as good as a book, but the movie adaptation managed to re-createHighsmith’s creepy depiction of a serial killer against the Mediterraneanbackdrop perfectly for me. ... TV DRAMASThe Bridge(created by Hans Rosenfeldt). I love strong characters and find the lead ofSaga Noren, the Swedish police detective, both intriguing and fascinating. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSTonySoprano, the mob boss from The Sopranos. While his methods of torture andkilling are deeply disturbing, there is a real sense of humanity and normalityto parts of his daily life which left me both feeling sorry for him and rootingfor him at times. Bizarre! ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESI wouldhave to go back to my roots and the early detectives that lured me into thegenre here, and Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes comes out top, every time. A gooddetective character, for me, is someone who not only employs particularobservational skills and excellent logical reasoning, but who is also enigmatic.Holmes has these skills in abundance and while the novels have been brilliantlyadapted, many times over the years, the character never loses these essentialtraits. ... MURDER WEAPONS A leg oflamb. In Roald Dahl’s A Lamb to the Slaughter, a wife kills her policedetective husband by hitting him over the head with a frozen leg of lamb. Afterwardsshe cooks the lamb and when investigators arrive (who are friends of herhusband), she is interviewed and later offers them the roast lamb for dinnerwhich, after a long shift, they eventually accept. They eat the lamb whilediscussing the murder weapon.     ... DEATH SCENESDexterMorgan (created by Jeff Lindsay), a blood spatter expert who also doubles up asa vigilante serial killer. He tracks down serious criminals, takes them to ascene that has been forensically  prepared to leave no trace, kills them, chopsthem up and then dumps them into the ocean off the back of his boat called‘Slice of Life’.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI don’thave any specific websites I check on a regular basis, it really depends onwhat I’m researching at the time. This week’s internet history mainly focuses onthe subjects of entomology and asphyxiation. Nice! ... WRITING TIPSOne of thebest tips I have been given was to keep a diary of research notes for each book– places visited, people interviewed etc. – so that facts can be double checkedafter the first draft is complete. It generally takes me about a year to writea novel and, without this, often small details would get forgotten along theway. ... WRITING SNACKSI’m a hugetea drinker when writing generally.

MURDER WEAPONSRoaldDahl’s short story Lamb to the Slaughtercontains this. I have to credit Susi Holliday for pointing it out. I can’t saywhat it is – it’s a fast read – butI’ll give you a clue: it’s not a vase of daffodils. I don’t think …    ... DEATH SCENESAh, the endscene of The Vanishing, by TimKrabbe.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Paul Finch", "date": "Tuesday 25 April 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome PAUL FINCHto share his BEST OF CRIME ... ... AUTHORSTed Lewis,creator of Jack Carter, the racketeer-turned-avenger, who appeared in threenovels, Jack’s Return Home, Jack Carter’s Law and Jack Carter and the Mafia Pigeon. Thefirst one is the most memorable, not least because it was filmed in 1970 as theseminal crime thriller, Get Carter.It was probably the first adult crime novel I read, and it had a massive impacton me, primarily because it captured my home, the industrial north, so well.Ted Lewis had limited output; he sadly died at the age of 42, but he did morethan most to create that stark, gritty school of British noir. ... FILMS/MOVIESIronically,given my previous answer, my favourite crime thriller is not Get Carter, but probably The French Connection (1971), directedby William Friedkin, and of course, starring Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider.Even now, it breaks all the rules, eschewing plot and traditional narrative structurefor documentary-style uber-realism. It’s quite simply an eye-popper (no punintended), portraying a seedier, grimier New York than we’d ever seen before,and depicting inner city cops, not so much as heroes, but as the ruthless,hard-bitten individuals they are in real life. I was a cop myself, and this isstill one of the most authentic cop movies I’ve ever seen.... TV DRAMASWithoutdoubt, it’s The Sweeney (1975-78). Ithink you can see where this interview is going by now.  All of my preferences, thus far at least,date from a harder, tougher era, when we weren’t afraid to show what cops werereally like. I think The Sweeney hasdated badly now, if I’m honest, but at the time – when I was at my most impressionableage, I suppose – after slower-paced shows like Dixon of Dock Green – it was such a refreshing change to see ano-holds-barred action series that had pace, rawness and irreverence, with JohnThaw as Regan, the last word in roughneck DIs. It didn’t just make me want towrite about the cops, it made me want to join them. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSFor me,Donovan ‘Red’ Grant is one of the scariest killers in thriller fiction. Heappeared in Ian Fleming’s fifth James Bond novel, From Russia With Love (1957), as the quintessential professionalassassin. A muscular blond psychopath, he deserted the British Army in Berlin,and joined the Soviet counter-intelligence agency, SMERSH, becoming their chiefexecutioner. Despite his looks, he is totally asexual, has the eyes ‘of adrowned man’ and prefers to kill at the time of the full moon. Most folk willremember Robert Shaw’s mesmerising performance in the 1963 movie version.Anyone who can go toe-to-toe with 007 has got to be a serious opponent. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESAfter reflection,I think it has to be Art Keller, the DEA man in Don Winslow’s epic duo of ‘dopewar’ novels, Power of the Dog (2005)and The Cartel (2015). Keller is thearchetypical good guy, because, though flawed – as all our law-enforcementheroes must be these days – he’s up against an edifice of evil in the form ofthe Mexican cartels, a bunch of crime syndicates who will stop at nothing –including torture and mass murder – to advance their schemes. Keller is cleverrather than tough, and though by the end, he’s a pale, wearied shadow of theguy he was, you can’t help but love him for taking on such a monstrous opponent… and winning (of a fashion). ... MURDER WEAPONSFor me,it’s the actual hound of the Baskervilles. I’ve always been a horror fan aswell as a thriller fan, and the more gothic and traditional, the better. Hammer’s Hound of the Baskervilles(1959) was the first horror movie I was allowed to watch as a child, and itterrified me. I soon found myself reading the novel, which also wove a magical spell.The image of the vast, desolate moor and this monstrous beast of legend, whichit wasn’t actually difficult for a clever madman to recreate using perfectlynon-supernatural means, all make for one of the greatest crime thrillers everwritten. The Hound of Hell – can you think of a more hideous means by which tokill someone?    ... DEATH SCENESOne of themost horrific ever occurs in the second half of Don Winslow’s second dope warsaga, The Cartel (2015), when theZetas, a special forces group who have taken to drugs-dealing themselves, areenraged by a busload of itinerant workers accidentally straying onto theirpatch when business is in progress. What follows is the most harrowing massacreof the innocent you’re ever likely to read. Everyone on that bus, both men andwomen, are killed, but only after being used as playthings for hours, and whenthey die, it isn’t quick – they are garroted, burned, beheaded, etc. Itcompletely underlines the depths of evil in that astonishing novel.  ... BLOGS/WEBSITESSorry to beboring, but for me it’s always Wikipedia. I know it’s not necessarily the mostreliable source, but I tend to do most of my real research with people ratherthan websites; I have a list of various experts I can call on. If I ever needto look something up quickly, I find Wikipedia pretty useful for that. ... WRITING TIPSMake yourrejections work for you. First of all, accept that rejection slips are anoccupational hazard – we all get them (most of us could wallpaper our officeswith them). Secondly, learn from them. If an editor or publisher has gone tothe trouble of telling you why he’s knocking you back, you don’t have to agreewith it, but at least take note of what he/she is saying, and if that criticismcomes up again and again, consider that the fault may lie with you. Which isnot the end of the world, because if it’s something you can fix, do it – thatcould be the difference between getting rejected again next time, or making asale. ... WRITING SNACKSIt sounds abit self-indulgent, but today it’s cakes and ale. It isn’t exactly a traditionof ours, but today is publication day – as I write, ASHES TO ASHES has justbeen published – and someone has treated my wife (and business partner) Cathy,and I, to some cakes and a couple of light ales.

{"title": "The Roanoke Girls by Amy Engel", "date": "Sunday 23 April 2017", "text": "The Roanoke GirlsBy Amy EngelPublished by Hodder & Stoughton (7 March 2017)Publisher's descriptionBeautiful.Rich.Mysterious.The Roanokegirls seem to have it all. But there's a dark truth about them which is neverspoken. Every girl either runs away, or dies.Lane is oneof the lucky ones. When she was fifteen, over one long, hot summer at hergrandparents' estate in rural Kansas, she found out what it really means to bea Roanoke girl. Lane ran, far and fast. Until eleven years later, when hercousin Allegra goes missing - and Lane has no choice but to go back.She is aRoanoke girl.Is shestrong enough to escape a second time?My verdictThe Roanoke Girls is compelling and thought provoking. I loved it from the moment I started reading, with mesmerising writing that urged me to keep turning the pages. It's very difficult to review though, due to the difficult subject matter and not wanting to give too much away.This rich family has been covering up a tangled web of secrets for generations. The secrets are revealed early on - so no surprises there. In fact, they are hinted at but not portrayed in a graphic way, which means the book is chilling and leaves much to the imagination (which can be far more frightening than when it's written on the page in front of you).Don't be deceived by the pretty cover, as The Roanoke Girls is hiding a lot of darkness. It isn't a thriller, but there's a mystery at the heart of it, with plenty of flawed characters in a wonderful atmospheric setting. The chapters flit between past and present, and the author gradually peels back the layers, one by one.The Roanoke Girls is certainly not for people who steer clear of taboo subjects or get easily offended, and I expect it will be a controversial read.I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

AUTHORSEllyGriffiths is my favorite contemporary crime writer.  Her Ruth Galloway series invites the readerinto a vivid world – the bleak yet rich Norfolk landscape, archeological (ornot) remains, a sense of past and present merging – which is peopled with engagingcomplex characters (Cathbad is genius). Then Griffiths began the Mephisto/Stephens series and did it all overagain.... FILMS/MOVIESBlow Up (1966) by Michaelangelo Antonioni. Could bedescribed as a murder story with no named victim or killer in which the‘detective’ is a fashion photographer. I’ve always taken photographs (once developedin my dad’s dark room, now use my phone), I loved the idea of discovering thevictim’s body in a photograph rather than finding it in ‘real’ life. After Isaw this film (since seen many times) the sound of wind in the trees has neverbeen the same. It conjures up such a possibility of mystery.... TV DRAMASThe Killing (Danish version) Season 1. This has influencedmany wonderful dramas (Broadchurch being one). Not least that music swellingtowards the finale of an episode. It was the first time I’d seen the grief ofthe victim’s family depicted so realistically and given such prominence on tele.We saw the context for the murder as well as the gradual revelation of thetruth of the crime. It was as ground breaking and as absorbing as Prime Suspecthad been back in the day. I felt it was a novel come to life (rather thanadapted). ... FICTIONAL KILLERSHas to beTom Ripley in Patricia Highsmith’s novels. Highsmith a hero of mine and herbooks are where I first came upon the idea of the murderer getting away with itand the reader (me anyway) wanting them to. That’s despite disliking thekiller. Ripley is a fabulous creation. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESRuthGalloway is right up there. She’s methodical, intelligent, brave, informed andintuitive. As a child and young adult, I wanted to be both an archeologist anda detective. Galloway makes me realise that I’m better off sticking tocrime-writing. I respect her way of living and working. She legitimizes acertain level of domestic slippage I rather recognize, while doing her job verywell indeed. I emulate her! ...

This covers the question directly above too.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI readwidely when writing. I did a crash course in Botany for The House With No Rooms so I haunted the Kew Gardens website. The Dog Walker was mainly written fromexperience (except the murder bit) so I did lots of tramps along the KewTowpath with a small canine.

ONE BECAME A DETECTIVE... ONE BECAME A KILLER...One night changed their livesThirty years ago, the Longacre Children's Home stood on a London street where once-grand Victorian homes lay derelict. There its children lived in terror of Gordon Tallis, the home's manager.Cries in the fire and smokeThen Connor Laird arrived: a frighteningly intense boy who quickly became Tallis' favourite criminal helper. Soon after, destruction befell the Longacre, and the facts of that night have lain buried . . . until today.A truth both must hideNow, a mysterious figure, the Two O'Clock Boy, is killing all who grew up there, one by one. DI Ray Drake will do whatever it take to stop the murders - but he will go even further to cover up the truth.My verdictWow, Two O'Clock Boy is a great start to what is bound to be a brilliant crime series.Mark Hill has written a gripping & intriguing debut that kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through. It's well written, twisty, well plotted and highly addictive - very difficult to put down and filled with surprises and some unscrupulous characters.I won't give away any spoilers, but the plot focuses on Longacre Children's Home and a devastating fire 30 years earlier. It switches between the past and present as DI Ray Drake investigates a series of killings linked to the Longacre occupants. The tension builds up as the bodies pile up, and DI Drake is forced to make some difficult decisions that could affect his future and that of his family.The ending left me reeling - not wise to read it late into the night if you value your sleep! Certainly a book to challenge, make you think and chill you to the bone.I am very interested to see how this series pans out and where it goes from here. I love the London setting with many familiar landmarks and locations. Looking forward to the next one!I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

AUTHORSI can’tpossibly choose a single author. It’s an impossibility. I tell you what, though,I’m rereading a lot of Mark Billingham at the moment. My god, his Thorne novelsare good. ... FILMS/MOVIESLook, ifyou persist with these difficult questions, me and you are going to fall out.There are just too many wonderful crimey films. I don’t think any movieexperience will top going to see that single week in 1990 when I went for thefirst time to see Miller’s Crossing, The Grifters and Goodfellas. But I’ll gofor something a little bit different, which I watched again the other night. I’ma big fan of The Prestige, the tricksy-turnsy story of two magicians whose lifelongrivalry has murderous consequences. Part-thriller, part-sci-fi fable, it’s anelaborate shaggy-dog story. Even more impressive is Christopher Priest’s sourcenovel. ... TV DRAMASIn myopinion, The Shield is as good as anything that’s been on television. Itstarred Michael Chiklis as Vic Mackey, a corrupt cop in LA. It was a show thatjust seemed to accelerate across its seven seasons, cranking up the drama everhigher. If you ask me – and I guess you are actually asking me - The Shield is somethingof an underrated gem. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSThat’llhave to be George Harvey Bone, the protagonist in Patrick Hamilton’s wonderfulnovel Hangover Square. Bone is a damaged man, a would-be murderer and barfly, whofrequents the pubs of Earl Court on the eve of the Second World War. Bonebecomes obsessed with a manipulative would-be actress Netta and contemplatesher murder. You pray for him to break out of the terrible spiral he findshimself in and find some kind of redemption. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESI’ve alwayshad a soft spot for Charles Willeford’s down-at-heel detective Hoke Moseley.  Moseley appeared in four detective novelswritten before Willeford’s untimely death. You may remember the first book inthat sequence, Miami Blues, was made into a terrific movie starring AlecBaldwin, with Fred Ward as Moseley. Encouraged to write more Moseley novelsafter the success of the first, Willeford tired of his creation almostinstantly. His original follow-up, Grimhaven, featured Moseley murdering histwo teenage daughters. It was rejected by his editor as being, guess what - toodark. I’d love to read it. Photocopies of the manuscript reportedly change handsfor lots of money among a shadowy group of collectors. ... MURDER WEAPONSI’m notreally a fan of exotic poisons and toxins or elaborate deathtraps, but then I’ma lazy so-and-so. It all seems rather a lot of work sourcing that odourless,colourless fungi from somewhere down the Amazon and then having topainstakingly mix it into someone’s sparkly eyeshadow. A vat of acid seems likehard work to me. Who has time for that? Even a frozen leg of lamb means havingto find a parking space at Asda. Let’s keep it simple. Give me a cricket bat ora gun. A fire poker. A piece of piping. Some steep stairs. A golf club. A steakknife. A brick. Piano wire. A chisel, or a screwdriver. That’ll do.     ... DEATH SCENESPoor oldPaul Krendler in Hannibal springs to mind. Having the top of your skull openedand your own brains fed to you can’t be a lot of fun.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m a bigmovie buff, and I also have a very short attention span. Which means that whenI’m right slap-bang in the middle of writing a scene – someone’s lifting a gun,a guy’s begging for his life, it’s all getting very tense - I’ll suddenly have the urge to visit Dark Horizons orAin’t It Cool News or Den Of Geek to find out who’s greenlit a shared universeseries of movies where Bears Paddington and Barnaby race cars.

{"title": "Faithless by Kjell Ola Dahl - Blog Tour ", "date": "Friday 7 April 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Faithless by Kjell Ola Dahl. Faithless is being published by Orenda Books in paperback on 15 April 2017. Read on for my review ...FaithlessBy Kjell Ola DahlPublished by Orenda Books (Ebook - available now; Paperback - 15 April 2017)ISBN: 978-1910633274Publisher's description When thebody of a woman turns up in a dumpster, scalded and wrapped in plastic,Inspector Frank Frølich is shocked to discover that he knows her... and theirrecent meetings may hold the clue to her murder. As he begins to look deeperinto the tragic events surrounding her death, Frølich's colleague Gunnarstrandafinds another body, and things take a more sinister turn. With a cold caseinvolving the murder of a young girl in northern Norway casting a shadow, andan unsettling number of coincidences clouding the plot, Frølich is forced tolook into his own past to find the answers - and the killer - before he strikesagain.  My verdictOver the last couple of years, I've become a huge fan of Nordic Noir, thanks to the seamless translations published by Orenda Books. Faithless is no exception. The translation by Don Bartlett is perfect - the book is not only easy to read, but the narrative is rhythmic and fast paced.I haven't read any books by Kjell Ola Dahl before, and this book is the fifth in the series, so I don't know the characters' back stories. But this didn't detract from the intelligent well-conceived plot. Faithless can easily be read as a standalone.Inspector Frank Frølich is investigating the murder of a woman known to him - not only because he arrested her recently, but also because she was engaged to his childhood friend, who he hasn't seen for over 20 years. When the detectives link the murder with a cold case in northern Norway, they realise this isn't as straightforward as it seems. Meanwhile his colleague Gunnarstranda is investigating the disappearance of a university student - there's no trace of her, although there are plenty of suspects.Faithless reads like classic crime, with well-developed characters, an atmospheric setting and a tangled web of secrets and lies. It's a whodunnit set in the modern world but with many throwbacks to the past. Nordic Noir detectives seem to use their heads and old fashioned investigations more than technology when putting together the clues to solve their cases. I had no inkling about where the story was going, or who the culprit was, or even how everything was going to be resolved, before the end. A great surprise and a highly satisfying conclusion.The Oslo Detectives is another series to add to my very extensive reading list.I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

AUTHORSI’d have to plump for Ed McBain. His 87th Precinct serieswas a massive influence on me, and the books still occupy pride of place on mybookshelf. I love the procedural detail, the vivid descriptions of the city(fictional, although based closely on New York), the fast pace and the snappyinterplay between characters. ... FILMS/MOVIESThe Godfather. It’s one of the few films I can watch againand again. It broke the mould of crime movies, and the acting is superb.... TV DRAMAS NYPD Blue. I loved this for many of the reasons I love theEd McBain books. It had some great scripts and really engaging characters. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI was going to say Hannibal Lecter, but that’s too obvious.I think maybe Norman Bates instead. As soon as we meet him we feel an unease thatbuilds throughout the film. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESAndy Sipowicz (from NYPD Blue). What I like about Andy isthat he’s such a well-rounded character, with as many flaws as desirableattributes. He’s a terrific detective, but he’s also fighting an alcohol addiction and has some ratherquestionable views. There’s a nice paradox in the way he forges such a closebond with his police partners, but struggles badly to deal with relationshipsin his personal life.... MURDER WEAPONSAs a writer, I think the best murder weapon has to be anovel! I’m thinking of the end of Stephen King’s Misery, where Paul Sheldonstuffs the pages of his manuscript down Annie’s throat.     ... DEATH SCENESSee above! That final battle goes on for some time, and isutterly engrossing. At one point Sheldon even employs his typewriter as aweapon.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI think it would have to be Wikipedia.

As a working mum it's not easy for Zoe, butlife is good.But thenEvie begins to receive letters and gifts.The senderclaims to be her birth father.He has beenlooking for his daughter.And now heis coming to take her back...My verdictThe Stolen Child is a gripping psychological thriller. It covers some interesting themes (including adoption, a child's sense of belonging and alcohol foetal syndrome), with a more in-depth feel to it than many other books in this genre.The book is fast paced, with high suspense, and lots of emotion. It's also beautifully written with atmospheric descriptive narrative and realistic dialogue. I read over three-quarters in one sitting late one evening. I couldn't put the book down, trying to figure it all out. I thought I knew what was going on, but then I wasn't sure, and changed my mind yet again several times by the end.The Stolen Child is cleverly plotted, with red herrings strategically dotted all over, so that everyone becomes a suspect. I didn't particularly like Zoe or Ollie, the main characters, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment at all. This is a very twisty tale and a highly enjoyable read.I enjoyed the author's first book too, so I'm interested to see what she writes next.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher and through Lovereading."},

AUTHORSGillian Flynn is one of the best psychological thrillerwriters around. The plot of Gone Girl is an incredible jigsaw puzzle oftwists and reversals, the characters are Machiavellian and the prose is pitch-perfect.Flynn’s previous novel, Sharp Objects, doesn’t have such arollercoaster plot, but it’s much edgier with a searing twist that took mybreath away: perfect American deep South gothic-noir.... FILMS/MOVIESMinority Report. For me this is the perfectcombination of sci-fic, thriller, philosophical conundrum and crime. It’s setin 2054: there are no murders because the police’s PreCrime unit arrestcriminals before they can commit a crime. The film asks if you could predictthe future, can there ever be free will? I used the screenplay by Scott Frankand Jon Cohen as inspiration for the dialogue in my final scene in my firstthriller, Bone by Bone.... TV DRAMASWhether you love it or hate, I think Vince Gilligan createdthe perfect screenplay for Breaking Bad. It was horribly addictive! Ialso love Richard Warlow’s Ripper Street, set in Victorian London withEdmund Reid as the troubled detective. The characters and the plot are complexand the writing is brilliant. As fellow police officer, Benet Drake says:And is that not you all over,Mr. Reid? Your fevered eyes once more burning through the deceit of the world,in the hope that you might, at last, uncover its black mechanics. And there,perhaps, is the difference between you and I. I chose this work because Ibelieve... in my dull simplicity... that the inequities of this life might bechecked. But you... well, I've come to believe that you choose them in the hopethat they may never cease. For what then, Edmund Reid? What then for that restlesssoul of yours? ...

FICTIONAL DETECTIVESJackson Brodie in Kate Atkinson’s Case Histories,played by Jason Isaacs in the BBC drama series.

DEATH SCENE[Spoiler alert - for The Kind Worth Killing] In Peter Swanson’s The Kind WorthKilling, the protagonist is shot. That is pretty shocking: I mean, youdon’t normally bump off your main protagonist, who’s telling you the story inthe first person, a third of the way through the book. Shocking, but bold....

AUTHORSWhen youcrack open the spine of a James Lee Burke novel you are never in doubt that youare in for something special. There is a richness to this man’s writing thatcannot fail to delight. His words transport you so that you feel you are onlocation with the characters and I find his poetry combined with the vitalityand violence of his characters to be a potent combination. ... FILMS/MOVIESOne of myfavourites is Amadeus. Hard to believe it came out over thirty years ago. Itwas a stroke of genius from the writers to choose to portray the great manthrough the eyes of his rival, Antonio Salieri.Knowingnothing about classical music, I came to this movie on a wet, winter’safternoon, expecting little, and it completely captivated me. Such human drama.The emotions warring across Salieri’s face (F. Murray Abraham) –envy,resentment, admiration - as he takes dictation from the dying genius knowingthe worth of the music and knowing he would never ever manage anything nearlyas good – was a truly brilliant piece of acting.... TV DRAMASThere’s somany good stuff on TV these days, but I’ll plump for Breaking Bad. This wasanother one that sneaked up on me and what a bravura performance from Brian Cranston.As he moved from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to drug lord, I was completelyhooked. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSSorry to be so cliché, but Hannibal Lecter really caught myimagination. I remember reading the end of Silence of the Lambs, internallycheering the fact that he got away and asking myself, what the hell? He’s anunconscionable killer! And I realised for the author to have elicited such areaction from me it had to be a great piece of writing.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESJames LeeBurke’s Dave Robicheaux. He constantly breaks the ethical code duringthe course of just about every case he works on. He is a recovering alcoholicwho is haunted by his service in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War and hisimpoverished, tough childhood in Louisiana; his mother abandoned the family(and was later murdered) and his father was killed in an oil rig explosion.There’s a complexity to Robicheaux that I find endlessly fascinating. ... DEATH SCENESI can’trecall much detail on this, but I do remember laughing out loud at a fictionaldeath during a Carl Hiassen novel – not sure which one – which involved somebig game hunters importing an old and half-infirm rhinoceros into theEverglades in Florida.

The Restless Dead is being published in hardback by Bantam Press on 6 April 2017. Read on for my review...The Restless DeadBy Simon BeckettPublished by Bantam Press (6 April 2017)ISBN: 079-0593063477Publisher's descriptionOnce one ofthe country’s most respected forensics experts, Dr David Hunter is facing anuncertain professional – and personal – future. So when he gets a call fromEssex police, he’s eager for the chance to assist them.A badlydecomposed body has been found in a desolate area of tidal mudflats andsaltmarsh called the Backwaters. Under pressure to close the case, the policewant Hunter to help with the recovery and identification.It’sthought the remains are those of Leo Villiers, the son of a prominentbusinessman who vanished weeks ago. To complicate matters, it was rumoured thatVilliers was having an affair with a local woman. And she too is missing.But Hunterhas his doubts about the identity. He knows the condition of the unrecognizablebody could hide a multitude of sins. Then more remains are discovered – andthese remote wetlands begin to give up their secrets . . . My verdictThe Restless Dead is crime fiction at its best, with brilliant writing, shocks and surprises and strong characters.The book grabs your attention straight away, with vivid forensic detail describing what happens to a dead body in the water. I found this fascinating - and love that this level of detail continues throughout the book, giving it significant depth.The story takes place in an isolated marshy area in Essex - the perfect location for hidden bodies, with danger lurking around every corner. A body has been found but, due to significant decomposition, is difficult to identify, although the police believe they know the victim. Thought originally to be a suicide, the police investigation reveals this case isn't as straightforward as it seems.David Hunter, the main character, is uncertain about his future and still troubled by his tragic past. His police consultancy work has been drying up so he welcomes the offer of a new case. He becomes closer than expected to a family linked to the investigation, which leads to a conflict of interest. Gradually the police investigation, with David in a consultancy role, reveals family secrets and feuds within the local community.The setting is highly atmospheric, the characters well developed and the plot suitably gripping. There are a few subplots, which tie up well in the final few chapters - and the motive (although unexpected) is suitably gratifying, even though the book itself does end on a slight cliffhanger.This is the fifth book in the forensic anthropologist David Hunter series. I have read the first two books, so I knew some of David Hunter's background, but this was a couple of years ago so it wasn't fresh in my mind. I found it easy to dive back into David's life and believe this would work well as a standalone.Ideal for fans of Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reich (although this is streets ahead, in my opinion).Follow the Blog Tour"},

As a divorcee withfour kids, romance is on her to-do list, just below the laundry.DoctorGeoff’s relationship with actress Daisy is bound to be a bit dramatic. But whyall the mystery?My verdictHampstead Fever is a highly enjoyable read, with good writing and well-developed varied characters. I haven't read One Night at the Jacaranda, an earlier book that featured many of the same characters, and this was easy to read as a standalone.In Hampstead Fever, several strands are intertwined, linking the love lives of key characters together. Each chapter focuses on one particular character's relationships, but other characters drifted in and out with ease. For this reason, the book reminded me of the film Love Actually.I loved the underlying medical theme with its dark humour - a few important health messages snuck in there, which isn't surprising as the author is a GP. Be warned that there's lots of sex, slightly raunchy in places, so maybe it's not for those who prefer their fiction to be clean and cosy. I enjoyed the setting too, as I know Hampstead and the surrounding areas well - and there are several familiar London landmarks and locations.Hampstead Fever isn't my usual genre, as I read mainly crime fiction. But this certainly made a welcome change. It's fantastic that it's been picked for a WHSmith promotion that's running over Easter - available at 30 of their bookstores at airports and railway stations on a buy one, get one half price offer.

And I adore her detective, Roderick Alleyn, who has asense of humour along with impeccable dignity, intelligence and determination.He’s one of the more believable Golden Age detectives.... FILMS/MOVIESWitness forthe Prosecution (the Billy Wilder version from 1957). I first watched it when Iwas about twelve, I think on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and I still remember mysense of absolute shock and awe at the ending! ... TV DRAMASI think TheBridge has altered the landscape of TV crime dramas. Saga Noren is one of thegreat TV detectives and Sofia Helin plays her with total conviction.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThis is ahard one to answer without spoilers! Of the killers who announce themselves askillers from the off, it’s hard to beat Hannibal Lecter. He is iconic. As faras I know he’s now been played by four different actors – Brian Cox, AnthonyHopkins, Gaspard Ulliel and Mads Mikkelsen – and each of them have interpretedhim in different ways. Like Dracula, he is developing a mythology that extendsfar beyond the original books. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESLord PeterWimsey, by a mile. He’s charming and debonair, of course, but he’s also psychologicallycomplex and an ex-soldier who never backed away from a fight.

I do love RoaldDahl’s clever little story ‘Lamb to the Slaughter’ which has one of the bestand most mundane murder weapons imaginable. ... DEATH SCENETheprologue in P D James’s Devices and Desireswas one of the pieces of writing that made me want to be a crime writer. Ayoung girl leaves a disco too late to catch her bus home and becomes the fourthvictim of a serial killer. It’s a masterclass in building tension, skillfulexposition and a terrifying revelation at the end. There’s nothing graphicabout it, but it’s incredibly effective.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI useGoogle Maps a huge amount when I’m writing – it’s not a substitute for fieldtrips but it really helps to rough in details when you’re working on a firstdraft and you don’t want to take a day off to look around an area. I love wellwritten true crime and the success of the podcast Serial made long-form writingabout crime fashionable again. But inspiration can come from all sorts ofplaces. I found an idea for a story from a picture on Pinterest! ... WRITING TIPSSet a timelimit rather than a word count to achieve for the day; it’s kinder, because weall have days where the writing is hard, and it’s manageable. You can alwaysstay for longer if the work is going well! And finish what you start. Half abook won’t teach you anything about crafting a plot or developing yourcharacters – write the whole thing and work on it, even for experience.

{"title": "Boundary by Andrée A. Michaud - Blog Tour review", "date": "Wednesday 29 March 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Boundary blog tour. Boundary by Andrée A. Michaud was published on 23 March 2017 by No Exit Press.BoundaryBy Andrée A. MichaudPublished by No Exit Press (23 March 2017)ISBN: 978-1843449980Publisher's descriptionIt's theSummer of 1967. The sun shines brightly over Boundary Pond, a holiday haven onthe US-Canadian border. Families relax in the heat, happy and carefree. Hourstick away to the sound of radios playing 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' and 'AWhiter Shade of Pale'. Children run along the beach as the heady smell of barbecuesfills the air.ZazaMulligan and Sissy Morgan, with their long, tanned legs and silky hair, relishtheir growing reputation as the red and blonde Lolitas. Life seems idyllic.But thenZaza disappears, and the skies begin to cloud over...My verdictBoundary is a slow burning literary crime novel set on the border between the US and Canada in 1967.Driving the book is the death of two teenage girls in a holiday town that's popular with families. These best friends were on the cusp of womanhood, often mistaken for twins, enjoying their freedom and flirting with the boys and men. This idyllic setting seemed like a safe place for women and children over the summer months, their husbands returning every weekend after their working week. But the summer of sunshine and laughter turned to one of fear, distrust and paranoia, as the darkness of death descended on the community.The narrative assesses the impact the girls' deaths have on Andrea, a 12-year-old girl, and the police officer in charge of the case. The writing is haunting and atmospheric - beautiful, in fact, with highly descriptive evocative poetic passages. The stunning setting felt as alive as the well-developed characters themselves.This is a multi-layered whodunnit set against a backdrop of mysterious woods and the legend of a trapper who committed suicide in them. It's also a coming of age novel, as Andrea loses her childhood innocence and becomes more aware of the dangers around her.The book isn't always an easy read. It took me a while to get used to the style, as there's no dialogue, so it may not appeal to everyone. But I persisted, and looked beyond this, eventually immersing myself into this intelligent character-led story.Are you following the Blog Tour?"},

AllMaeve needs is one person to talk, but that’s not going to happen. Because evenin a case of murder, some secrets are too terrible to share…My verdictLet the Dead Speak is a police procedural but, since it's narrated in first person, I found that it also reads as a psychological thriller - a perfect combination.This is the seventh book in the Maeve Kerrigan series. I've read the first two books and the sixth, but not yet the ones in the middle. In fact, I read the sixth book as a standalone last year, and then started to catch up with the rest of the series. I just couldn't want any longer to read Let the Dead Speak, which is why I jumped ahead again. I do believe this book would work well as a standalone though.In Let the Dead Speak, a woman has disappeared from her home, leaving just a trail of blood - a lot of blood. Maeve Kerrigan has now been promoted to Detective Sergeant, and feels she has to prove her worth in her new role. As she investigates a murder without a body, she discovers a lot of suspects among the woman's neighbours. Her search for the truth reveals dark secrets and a whole host of lies.Jane Casey has a brilliant way of writing books that flow seamlessly. She maintains a fast pace with a good mix of tension, action and intrigue. This is a really easy read. I don't mean the plot is a simple one - it's complex and multilayered, with subtle, and not so subtle, twists, turn, surprises and red herrings. But the writing, as always, is excellent and a pleasure to read, with plenty of humour to lighten up the dark plot. The characters are varied and believable, and this great characterisation drives the story forward. I particularly love Maeve's relationship with Derwent (in fact, I particularly love Derwent...).Jane Casey's books get better and better! I can't praise this book highly enough. I loved it and didn't want it to end.I received an Advance Reader Copy."},
{"title": "Why the change of direction? by Jane Lythell", "date": "Monday 27 March 2017", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Jane Lythell to my blog today, to talk about why she has changed direction with her novels. Woman of the Hour was published by Head of Zeus in paperback on 3 November 2016. Why the change of direction with my novels?By Jane LythellMy first two novelsThe Lie of You and After the Storm are psychological thrillers. I have alwaysbeen interested in what drives a person to do extreme things and in these twobooks I explored obsessive behaviour.The Lie of You isabout Heja who wants to destroy Kathy who is her work colleague. Kathy is a newmum and is struggling to cope on her return to work. She feels all her work errors are of her own making.Gradually her home life as well as her work life starts to fall apart. In factshe is being systematically undermined by Heja. Heja is a chilling and obsessive woman and yet by the end of the bookthe reader understands what drove her to act as she did and maybe even to feelsome sympathy for her. We all have a darkside which we hide from the world. Sometimes something happens which tips aperson into full blown obsession. My second novelAfter the Storm is set in Belize City and an island in the Caribbean Sea. Thereare four main characters: British couple Anna and Rob and an American coupleOwen and Kim who have an old sailing boat theyhave been living on for three years. On their first night in Belize Anna andRob meet Owen and Kim. Owen suggests they charter his boat and he will takethem to the island of Roatan, where the diving is sensational. Anna is fearfulbut Rob persuades her it will be a great adventure. Unknown to them Kim isdesperate to go home to Florida but Owen is determined to continue their lifeon the boat. Straightaway we have conflict of wishes between the fourcharacters and a small boat is a very claustrophobic place whentensions start to build.Thetwo couples set off. It takes ten days to reach Roatan and that is a long timewhen one of the four, Owen, is hiding a terrible secret that is eating away athim. The strapline of the bookis Some Secrets Destroy You. Thestorm of the title is both a weather storm and a psychological storm. By theend of the novel all four characters have been changed by spending this intensetime together. The underlying theme is that you need to bring dark secrets outinto the light of day in order for them to lose their destructive power.I greatly enjoyedexploring the dark side of my characters in both these novels. With a thrilleryou set up a problem that has to be solved and you are guaranteed a strongforward momentum. Given this why did I decide to change direction with my thirdnovel and move away from psychological thrillers to writing contemporarywomen’s fiction?The reason was thatI had a strong desire to write about the issues raised by a woman’s workinglife. So many novels depict women’s family and emotional lives. I’veseen much less fiction about a woman struggling with the pressures of work. Yetthat had been my life. A single working mother, trying to keep all the balls upin the air, feeling conflicted about competing pressures. I wanted to explorethat.I wanted to write a strong female character who also has herweaknesses and vulnerabilities. My heroine Liz Lyon is 41 years old anddivorced. She is a respected TV producer and a guilty single mother. I wantedto show the whole woman: work-Liz, calm, controlled, soothing egos and managinga difficult boss and home-Liz who is far more emotional and reveals her real thoughtsand feelings. At work Liz has to bite her tongue and censor what she says. Athome she can let rip. And she fears that she is a better mother to her team thanshe is to her beloved daughter Flo.The drama of the workplace offers such a rich vein toexplore in fiction. So many issues and moral dilemmas are thrown up by thisaspect of our lives. There are power struggles, intrigue and betrayals as wellas moments of satisfaction and fulfilment. I think it isimportant not to keep doing the same thing in your writing just because itworked the first time. I worked as a producer in television for 15 years and sawthis happen too often where repetition of a successful format stifled creativity.You have to trust in your readers as why would they want the same thing overand over? Finally, for me the most important thing is to createcharacters my readers believe in. It doesn't matter if they dislike a characteror adore them. But it does matter if my readers don't believe in them.I am currentlywriting a second book about Liz Lyon and StoryWorld TV station which will bepublished by Head of Zeus in August. About Jane LythellJaneLythell lives in Brighton and is a sea-lover, star gazer, film and footballfan. She worked as a television producer for fifteen years.

AUTHORSMy all-timefavourite crime novel isn’t actually by a crime author. It’s The Collector byJohn Fowles who also wrote The French Lieutenant’s Woman. It’s a brilliantlycreepy novel about a young man who abducts a young art student and keeps herlocked up in his cellar. I found the power play between the two main charactersutterly fascinating and I thought the ending was superb. A more contemporaryauthor that I’m a huge fan of is Belinda Bauer. All novels are very differentfrom each other but they’re all brilliantly written and feature her trademarkblack humour and wit. I particularly recommend Rubbernecker, Blacklands and TheBeautiful Dead.... FILMS/MOVIESI don’t think youcan beat The Silence of the Lambs as an example of a truly brilliant crimefilm. The cast – Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Ted Levine – are at the topof their game and the plot is faultless. Respect to the director Jonathan Demmefor turning an excellent book into an outstanding film.... TV DRAMASWhere to start? Inrecent years we’ve been spoilt with top notch TV dramas, both here and acrossthe pond. Happy Valley, Luther, True Detective, Call of Duty, Broadchurch andThe Wire all jump into my head when I think about quality TV drama. Thenthere’s the original Scandinavian broadcast of The Bridge which was utterlybrilliant. I binge watched the first three series over a couple of weeks andwas bereft when it ended. Saga Norén is an amazing character and I can’t waitfor series four to air. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSI know SophieHannah chose Dexter but I have to agree with her choice. Dexter is such anunusual character. I love that he kills to the code that his father defined(basically, bad guys). I also love how socially awkward he is and the touchesof dark humour. It’s rare to root for the killer but I was desperate for Dexterto evade capture. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESI’m a big fan ofthe Sherlock home reboot on the BBC. I always used to see Sherlock Holmes asvery dry and dusty, a Victorian gentleman in a deerstalker, but BenedictCumberbatch (and the team of writers) have breathed new life into him and nowhe appeals to a whole new audience.... MURDER WEAPONSWithout giving toomuch away there’s a fabulous scene at the end of Paula Daly’s book Keep Your Friend’s Close where a flaw inthe antagonist (only briefly mentioned at the beginning of the book) is used bythe main character to kill her off. I thought it was a ridiculously clever wayto kill someone off and actually said ‘bravo!’ when I read it. Brilliant.    ... DEATH SCENESI’m sure anotherscene will jump into my dead the minute I finish this interview but right nowthe most memorable death scene I can think of is Mrs Danvers dying in a fire,with burning wood falling all around her in Rebeccaby Daphne du Maurier.   ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI’m a big fan ofGoogle Earth and Street Maps when it comes to researching my novels. As anon-driver I can nip across Bristol, or the country, to check out a locationfor one of my books. I also read a lot of articles online about abnormalpsychology and use YouTube to watch old documentaries.... WRITING TIPSI always start my novels this way – I think about what mymain character wants more than anything else in the world then I throwobstacles in her way to stop her from achieving it. I also give her a characterflaw that makes it harder for her to obtain her goal. I’ve been told I’m a very‘pacy’ writer and that’s because I’m easily bored. I don’t particularly enjoywriting descriptive passages and prefer to focus on action and dialogue. In thewords of Elmore Leonard I ‘try to leave out all the parts that readers skip’. Ithink that’s good advice for any writer. About CALLY TAYLORC.L.

{"title": "The Birdwatcher by William Shaw", "date": "Monday 20 March 2017", "text": "The BirdwatcherBy William ShawPublished by riverrun (Paperback - 9 February 2017)ISBN: 978-1784297244Publisher's descriptionSergeantWilliam South has always avoided investigating murder. A passionate birdwatcherand quiet man, he has few relationships and prefers it that way.But whenhis only friend is found brutally beaten, South's detachment is tested. Notonly is he bereft - it seems that there's a connection between the suspect andhimself.For Southhas a secret. He knows the kind of rage that killed his friend. He knows thekind of man who could do it. He knows, because Sergeant William South himselfis a murderer.Moving fromthe storm-lashed, bird-wheeling skies of the Kent Coast to the wordless war ofthe Troubles, The Birdwatcher is a crime novel of suspense, intelligenceand powerful humanity about fathers and sons, grief and guilt and facing thedarkness within.My verdictHaving seen crime writers raving about The Birdwatcher on social media, I decided to treat myself to one of the glossy Goldsboro Signed Limited Edition Hardbacks. And I'm certainly glad that I did.DS William South is a quiet man leading a solitary existence, with birdwatching on the isolated marshes as his only passion in life. A neighbourhood police officer with no desire for the limelight, he is reluctant to get involved in a murder investigation, even when he discovers that the victim was one of his neighbours, a fellow birder and possibly his only friend.The Birdwatcher intrigued me from its brilliant first few lines, leaving me wondering what secrets DS William South was hiding. It's written in sharp succinct narrative with natural dialogue and vivid descriptions of the haunting bleak landscape. The characters are well developed and the slow-burning plot is cleverly constructed.As the story gradually unfolds, we learn more about South's childhood in Northern Ireland through a series of flashbacks dotted throughout the book. This links the present day murder with events nearly 40 years earlier.An intelligent yet also quirky read, The Birdwatcher kept me gripped right until the end, with some surprises along the way. It's far more than just 'another police procedural' and definitely a book to recommend."},
{"title": "Watch Me by Angela Clarke", "date": "Friday 17 March 2017", "text": "Watch MeBy Angela ClarkePublished by Avon (12 January 2017)ISBN: 978-0008174613Publisher's descriptionYOU HAVESIX SECONDS TO READ THIS MESSAGE…The body ofa 15-year-old is found hours after she sends a desperate message to herfriends.

Butwhoever’s behind the notes is playing a deadly game of hide and seek – and theclock is ticking.YOU HAVE 24HOURS TO SAVE THE GIRL’S LIFE. MAKE THEM COUNT.My verdictI thought that Watch Me was a step up from Follow Me. It felt more serious and more refined, with weightier narrative, more developed characters and more realistic dialogue.The story picks up soon after Follow Me with original characters - Nas and Freddie - alongside some new ones, now that police officer Nas has been transferred to a different department. While Watch Me could possibly be read as a standalone, I do think readers will find it easier if they read Follow Me first to understand the characters' backstories.The plot is tense and gripping, with plenty of twists and turns, and kept me guessing all the way through. Nas and Freddie are on a race against the clock, with 24 hours to save a missing girl, which added to the tension and pace.This crime thriller series is current and modern, using social media to showcase crimes. So far it has covered Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram, and I look forward to seeing what's next.I received an Advance Reader Copy."},
{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with David Young", "date": "Wednesday 15 March 2017", "text": "Welcome to my BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome DAVID YOUNGto share his BEST OF CRIME... ... AUTHORSWilliamRyan. I missed out on Bill as a tutor on my MA at City University London – Iwas a year too early. But I love his Korolev series set in Stalin’s SovietUnion and am delighted to hear he’s at work on more. His standalone TheConstant Soldier was excellent too – no books of his have disappointed me.... FILMS/MOVIESAlthoughnot ‘crime’ as such, I thought Bridge of Spies was a great film. Probably myfavourite of recent times. With a cracking performance by Tom Hanks.... TV DRAMASI startedSpiral/Engrenages at Series 5, then devoured the previous four series and havebeen chomping at the bit for Series 6. The detectives are all fab – I loveLaure, Gilou and Tintin as a team. But as well as the gritty realism of thepolice work, what makes it so special is the behind-the-scenes machinations atthe Palais de Justice. Judge Robain is possibly my favourite character.... FICTIONAL KILLERSLou Ford inJim Thompson’s classic, The Killer Inside Me. It was one of our set books liston my Creative Writing MA, and one which perhaps made the biggest impression.It’s disturbing how likeable someone so evil is, which is testament toThompson’s superb writing. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESI’m lovingInspector Borowski on All4’s Walter Presents. In fact, it runsSpiral/Engrenages a close second for my favourite TV show, although the storiesare more variable in quality than those in the French drama. At the heart of itare the great performances by Axel Milberg in the lead role as the Kiel-basedGerman detective. A fabulous character. ... MURDER WEAPONSThefull-body gilding used to kill Goldfinger’s secretary in the James Bond filmbased on the Ian Fleming novel of the same name. It was thought at the timethat painting the entire body could cause asphyxiation, which is why a smallportion of actress Shirley Easton’s body was left unpainted in the film. Infact, as long as you can still breathe through your nose or mouth, allegedlythis wouldn’t happen. I don’t intend to test it out anytime soon. ... DEATH SCENEI ratherlike the opening of RN Morris’s A Gentle Axe. An elderly woman searching forfirewood in frozen St Petersburg discovers the body of a swarthy peasantswinging from a tree with a bloodied axe in his belt. Nearby, is a suitcasecontaining the body of a dwarf – his head split in two by an axe. Soatmospheric.    ... BLOGS/WEBSITESThere’s anexcellent blog about East Germany called The GDR Objectified, written by aCanadian, John Paul Kleiner. It really is a treasure trove for anyoneinterested in the GDR. Great pieces about two key settings in my latest novel,Stasi Wolf – Halle Neustadt and Oberhof. Oberhof is my main protagonistOberleutnant Karin Müller’s hometown, and you can find John Paul’s take on ithere. ... WRITING TIPSWritingwhat you know is of course a great tip. But I rather enjoy turning it on itshead. I’m passionate about researching, and then writing about, what I don’tknow. For me, it makes it all more exciting. I never visited East Germanybefore the Wall came down, yet I have a novel series set there. My maincharacter is female. And when I started out, I couldn’t speak German beyondordering a beer or booking a hotel room (I’ve been learning but haven’tadvanced much).... WRITING SNACKSI’verecently discovered Cadbury’s Dairy Milk Chopped Nut chocolate – it’s got thesame luxurious feel as the Milka broken hazelnut version. But most of the timeI try to stay healthy with nuts and dried cranberries without the chocolate –washed down by Asda Earl Grey tea (cheaper than Twinings but tastes just as good).About David YoungDavid Young was born near Hull and, after dropping out of a Bristol University sciencedegree, studied Humanities at Bristol Polytechnic. Temporary jobs cleaningferry toilets and driving a butcher’s van were followed by a career injournalism on provincial newspapers, a London news agency, and internationalradio and TV newsrooms. He now writes in his garden shed and in a caravanon the Isle of Wight, and in his spare time supports Hull City AFC.Find David Young on his website, Facebook page and on Twitter - @djy_writerAbout Stasi WolfPublisher's descriptionEast Germany, 1975.

Some of the plot may seem a little far fetched, but it's great fun and a gripping rollercoaster read.Tell Me A Lie features a highly original modern plot but has a classic spy thriller feel to it too, with more than a hint of James Bond.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Marnie Riches ", "date": "Monday 13 March 2017", "text": "Welcome to my latest BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome MARNIE RICHESfor her Born Bad blog tourto share her BEST OF CRIME... ... AUTHORSMyfavourite author in the crime genre is Thomas Harris, simply because he wrote The Silence of the Lambs, which is crimefiction perfection. For years, I was also a Scandi Noir devotee and loved StiegLarsson - not necessarily for the elegance of his prose, but for the complexityof his stories, his characters and wonderfully insightful depiction of Swedish life.... FILMS/MOVIESI can’tonly choose one! Perhaps it marks me out as a 1990s throwback, but aside fromthe seminal The Silence of the Lambswith Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, I’m a huge fan of Tarantino andparticularly adored Pulp Fiction. Tarantino’sstories and scripts really are top class. I loved Guy Ritchie’s Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.His story-telling and stylistic cinematography were great and I love thedepiction of London – I was living in Surrey Quays in S.E. Docklands at thetime! In Bruges was a darkly comicmasterpiece. Nowadays, I think the Scandis do crime movies best. The Swedishbig screen adaptations of Larsson’s MillenniumTrilogy were cracking – Noomi Rapace had me transfixed. I loved Headhunters and loved, loved, loved Jackpot – both Jo Nesbo stories on thebig screen. I like my crime with a little dark humour and those two films havethem in spades. Some of the best crime drama of late has most definitely beenon TV…... TV DRAMASWell, Breaking Bad of course! Without doubt,the best TV drama since… The Wire,which was the best TV drama EVER. Every series of both Breaking Bad and The Wirewere flawless. Just brilliant. There was humour, violence, ingenious intrigue...The dialogue crackled. The characters were breathtakingly well drawn. The setswere SO authentic. The acting was phenomenal. I don’t mind saying that Breaking Bad inspired some of The Girl Who Had No Fear. And obviouslythere are the Scandis – what’s not to love about The Bridge and The Killing(not the American version, of course, but the original Danish)? Well written,beautifully shot, perfectly acted. Oh, and FARGO!!!Fargo has been incredible – bothseasons 1 and 2. Billy Bob Thornton as the nutter? And Kirsten Dunst? Ah, thesurprises just kept coming. I loved it. And then, there was the first season ofTrue Detective with MatthewMcConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Bloody brilliant! Nothing on British TV hasmeasured up to the US and Scandinavian offerings, I’m afraid. Not for me.... FICTIONAL KILLERSOn screen,I absolutely love Hannibal Lecter, Walter White, Jules Winnfield and StringerBell. Who can argue with the performances of Anthony Hopkins, Bryan Cranston,Samuel L. Jackson and Idris Elba? So much of on-screen charisma is down to theactor, as much as the script. Omar from The Wire, played by Michael K.Williams, is one of the coolest characters on TV. I loved the romance andpoignancy of Richard Harrow in BoardwalkEmpire, played by the yummy Jack Huston. In print, Lecter (again), GraemeCameron’s unnamed protagonist in Normalis highly entertaining. Peter Swanson’s Lily Kintner in A Kind Worth Killing is a dastardly cowbag!... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESObviouslyPaul van den Bergen is my favourite detective – I would say that!

If you can describe it in one or two sentences, you’re on tosomething that readers will want to pick up and read. If you can fit your storyinto a two page synopsis with a beginning, middle and an end, the writing willbe that much easier. Keep your high points roughly at 25%, 50% and 75% of theway through. Keep your beginnings and endings sharp. Make every chapter count.Write every day, if you can. Edit ruthlessly. If you’re bored whilst readingit, cut it.

AUTHORSOh crikey,now that’s a tough one to start with. I’m limited to those authors I’ve readand, as I don’t read too many fiction books, that isn’t a very large pool. So,I’m going to stick with an author who has always managed to engage me to a putwhere I couldn’t put the book down – Lee Child.... FILMS/MOVIESThe ItalianJob. Although this is something of a ‘crime caper’, I’m a great fan of MichaelCaine and thought that his character – Charlie Croker – was excellent. Hisinfamous line, ‘you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors’ is oft quotedwhen Ordnance Disposal officers carry out work on IEDs and unexploded bombs. Iparticularly liked this ending – the actual cliffhanger – to this film wherethe team are stuck with their loot on a bus overhanging a cliff. It’s a perfectlead into a sequel and maybe one of the only films that has given rise toscience competions asking viewers ‘How could they escape in less than thirtyminutes and without using a helicopter’. The answer – I’ll leave you to look itup – was pure genius.... TV DRAMAS24, with nohesitation. I loved Jack Bauer and couldn’t wait for the next hour, the nextseries. Loved them all.... FICTIONAL KILLERSHannibalLecter. I particularly enjoyed the way the author established the relationshipbetween Lecter and Clarice Starling – the FBI agent. As both hunted a serialkiller whose depravity defied our understanding, the story gradually revealshow much worse is Lecter, and how brilliantly manipulative. Thankfully, inreality, serial killers tend to be less intelligent and more frustrated people.Well educated, talented psychopaths tend to explore less bloody careers, asartists, in business and – as we are coming to appreciate more and more – inpolitics.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESThesearen’t getting any easier. For me, this has to be Detective Chief InspectorEndeavour Morse, GM. Made all the more real for me by the accomplished actingof the late John Thaw. Colin Dexter created an amazing character who appealedto all of us. His beloved Jaguar, his love of real ale, his wit, intelligenceand taste in music. It all added up to a character with the kind of depth uswriters can only dream of creating. I realize now, as I write this, thatDexter’s decision to have the character known by his surname was hugelyinfluential on my decision to do the same with Robert Finlay.... MURDER WEAPONS‘Do youexpect me to talk?’ ‘No, Mr Bond. I expect you to die.’ Remember the scene? Asour hero James Bond is about to be cut in half – from his crotch – by a redlaser operated by Auric Goldfinger. I couldn’t pick this for the next categoryas, of course, James lives to fight another day.     … DEATH SCENESOne that Ifound particularly imaginative, although perhaps not given the creative abilityof the author. In Dead Man’s Grip, Peter James has a professional hitmandispatch his target dispassionately and ruthlessly. The poor victim ishandcuffed to the steering wheel of a car after being tortured. To provesuffering, the hitman films the whole death. Horrid – gripping!... BLOGS/WEBSITESWikipedia,by far, even given it’s slight reputation for inaccuracy.  If it doesn’t show the answer to a question,it will point you in the right direction.... WRITING TIPSFirstdrafts don’t need to be perfect, they just have to be written....

While undergoing treatment, he was encouraged by hiscounsellor to write about his career and his experience of murders, shootingsand terrorism.

{"title": "Quieter Than Killing by Sarah Hilary ", "date": "Thursday 9 March 2017", "text": "Quieter Than KillingBy Sarah HilaryPublished by Headline (9 March 2017)ISBN: 978-1472241108Publisher's descriptionIt'swinter, the nights are dark and freezing, and a series of seemingly randomassaults is pulling DI Marnie Rome and DS Noah Jake out onto streets of London.When Marnie's family home is ransacked, there are signs that the burglary canhave only been committed by someone who knows her. Then a child goes missing,yet no-one has reported it. Suddenly, events seem connected, and it's personal.Someone outthere is playing games. It is time for both Marnie and Noah to face the truthabout the creeping, chilling reaches of a troubled upbringing. Keeping quietcan be a means of survival, but the effects can be as terrible as killing.My verdictWhen reading Quieter Than Killing, I wanted to whiz through quickly, desperately needing to know what was going to happen next. But fortunately I managed to stop myself from sneaking ahead or reading too fast, as this is a book that needs to be savoured, with its clever plotting and brilliant writing.This book is deliciously dark, with chilling descriptions of London in a harsh winter and the investigation into a series of vigilante crimes. Marnie Rome is seemingly caught in the middle of a very tangled web. The plot is original, intriguing and compelling from beginning to end. Sarah Hilary isn't afraid to delve deep into some disturbing contemporary social issues.The Marnie Rome series is one of my crime fiction favourites, with a strong female lead and great character-driven plots. Each book reveals more about Marnie Rome's troubled past, and she's certainly a character that I am genuinely interested in. While it wouldn't be essential to read the earlier books (this is the fourth in the series), it would probably help to set the scene and provide her backstory.Quieter Than Killing answers more questions about Marnie's foster brother, but asks more questions too. Looking forward to the next Marnie Rome book already.I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Antagonists by Matt Wesolowski - Six Stories Blog Tour", "date": "Wednesday 8 March 2017", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Matt Wesolowski to my blog today for his Six Stories blog tour, to talk about antagonists (or rather, his favourite 'baddies'). Six Stories is being published by Orenda Books on 30 March 2017. And it's BRILLIANT (see below for the link to my review).Antagonists (i.e. my favourite baddies)By Matt WesolowskiI was lucky as a child; we had a couple of good theatrecompanies in mid 1980s Newcastle that did some excellent children's shows. One of which is TheBruvvers Theatre Company - still going today and it was through them that Ifound my love of 'the baddies' or, I suppose as an adult...and a writer, Ishould refer to as 'antagonists'. (Baddies sounds better, mind!)My dad used to take me to loads of these shows at NorthernStage, Newcastle (back then, the Newcastle Playhouse and Gulbenkien Studio). Iremember at about 7 or 8 years old, being much more impressed and able toempathise with the sword-wielding 'baddy'  dressed in black, being booed by the audience.It used to upset me that the baddy was eventually  thwarted by a simpering 'goodie' who alwayswon in the end. Says a lot about me as a kid, to be fair! One of my finest memories back then was being given one ofthe baddies' swords to hold as I was the only one cheering for him in theaudience (I guess there was less health and safety fears about letting an 8year old hold a metal replica sword back in the 80s)...whoever that actor was,he pretty much made my life, that day!It'sno surprise that this adoration of the antagonist bled into my reading, mywriting and my TV habits (it still does). For me, there's nothing better than agood baddie, so I'm going to list a few of my hopefully not-too-obviousfavourite baddies (sorry...antagonists)of literature and screen.1. Blaine the Mono (The Dark Tower Saga - Stephen King)Articulate, charming and with a love of riddles. He cantravel at over 900 mph and create a sonic boom. This guy is a train. A bright pink monorail. He's alsoa maniac, hell bent on murder and suicide. What on earth is there not to likeabout Blaine? Potential Tinder profile, right? (Or is a train's dating appcalled 'Tender'?)2. Francie Brady (TheButcher Boy - Patrick McCabe)Protagonist or antagonist? This book was the first Iremember that made me question this. Francie is the product of a broken,abusive home, looked down on by the small town in which he lives, committed toan 'industrial school' run by priests with dubious urges and eventually killshis next door neighbour with a bolt gun. What's so heartbreaking about Francieis the extent to which you can empathise or at least sympathise with him. Thatlies in the skill of the author. One of my all time favourite books,3. John Doe - Se7enJohn Doe hates the world, he despises the people in it; thevery act of a stranger starting a conversation with him in public makes himwant to vomit. In fact, he does vomit and then 'can't stop laughing'. There'ssomething about that I can empathise with. His MO is so damn clever that howevertwisted and evil the man is, you simply cannot help admiring him. Plus, it'sKevin Spacey at his very best. 4. The Sheriff of Nottingham (Robin Hood Prince of Thieves)Talking of actors at their best - this is a sublimeperformance from the late Alan Rickman who steals the show with hisdevil-worshipping sadist, the Sherriff of Nottingham. Forget Serverus Snape;dressed in black, handy with a sword and a penchant for cutting out hearts witha spoon, this character was one of my favourites growing up and I was always abit gutted when goody two-shoes Costner stuck him with a sword, invoking someof the best dying-breath dribble that has graced the silver screen.No one remembers any of Robin Hood's lines, but Rickmancoined the immortal phrase from this film regarding heart-cutting out andspoons:  'It's blunt youtwit, it'll hurt more!'About Matt WesolowskiMattWesolowski is an author from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the UK. He is an Englishtutor and leads Cuckoo Young Writers creative writing workshops for youngpeople in association with New Writing North.

Enter elusive investigative journalist Scott King, whose podcast examinations of complicated cases have rivalled the success of Serial, with his concealed identity making him a cult internet figure.My verdictAs soon as I read the blurb for Six Stories, I was intrigued. But I have to admit that I began reading the book with some trepidation as I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations.My verdict? WOW! Not only did it live up to my expectations but it surpassed them.Six Stories is unlike anything else I've read. It's current, fresh and skillfully delivered. There's a classic murder mystery to solve - the death of a teenager in 1996 and the discovery of his body a year later. Twenty years on, a leading investigative journalist is looking at the evidence and interviewing those who were present at the time. The way in which he is conducting his investigation (through a series of podcasts) is as modern as you could possibly get in the digital age.When I read a book, I have to read whole chapters at a time. I can't stop a reading session in the middle of the chapter - call it a foible of mine! With Six Stories, I found myself reading a whole podcast at a time (including the previous chapter - you'll have to see why), so that I could digest the information and then think about what I had just read. Some of the podcasts are fairly long - not surprising as there are only six in the book. I also had to find time to concentrate without a risk of interruption, so read most of the book late in the evenings.Six Stories is an eerie spine-tingling read. It's unpredictable and chilling and kept me guessing all the way through. I don't scare easily, but certainly found this book unsettling. Matt Wesolowski has built up a dark, atmospheric setting with his vivid descriptive prose. The voices were so distinctive that I felt like I was listening to a podcast rather than simply reading the transcript. I built up a picture of the people, relationships between characters and an amazing sense of place. It felt more like fact than fiction - and I had to keep reminding myself that Scarclaw Fell isn't real!I'm not familiar with Serial, which is what Six Stories is being compared with, although I will now be checking it out. But I do feel this book will appeal to fans of the documentary Making a Murderer. In some ways, its horror element reminded me of the Blair Witch Project - it's what you can't see that's most frightening. Scarclaw Fell will remain with me - and I'll be thinking about what happened to Tom Jeffries - for some time.Everyone will want to read this book - and should!I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Then she heard adoor slam and turned toward the sound. Her heart leapt, though she could hardlybelieve what she saw. For there, just a few hundred yards away, was a farmhouseall lit up. A plump, middle-aged woman headed straight toward them. She lookedlike someone’s favorite aunt, wearing a loose-fitting housedress, her wispybrown hair pinned up messily. It was surreal,unfathomable, yet there she was, walk- ing across the moonlit yard filled withscrubby brush, past an overturned wheelbarrow and a clothesline where shirtstwisted precariously in the wind, the cuffs of the sleeves nearly touching theground. Julie thought atfirst it was a hallucination, but no, she was real. Hope welled up in her. It’sso hard to kill hope. Her abductorstill had her by the arm, with the nose of the gun now pushed into her back,but she took a chance that he wouldn’t kill her in front of a witness. ‘Help me! Thisman kidnapped me. Call the police. Run! He’s dangerous. He has a gun!’ In that momentshe felt a rush of relief. Help was here. Maybe there were even others insidewho had heard her scream. But the womandidn’t react. She just walked toward them, calm and unhurried. ‘Do you hear me?This man abducted me! I need help!’ Everything beganto unfold in slow motion. The woman’s lips were pressed tightly together, hereyes fixed steadily on Julie’s captor. There could be no mistaking thesituation. She had to get it. But her expression wasn’t right. If anything, thewoman’s eyes glistened with a kind of adoration. She ignored Julie, who stoodthere frozen. Julie realized at that moment that this woman was not appalled oroutraged or terrified.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Neil White", "date": "Monday 6 March 2017", "text": "Welcome to my BEST OF CRIME feature, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome NEIL WHITEto share his BEST OF CRIME... ... AUTHORSI don’t tend to follow any particularauthor and instead go for whatever looks interesting. I’ve always enjoyed GreggHurwitz’s books and Carl Hiaasen. In fact, the latter reminds me that I am afan of darkly comic crime, like Christopher Brookmyre and Bateman. There aren’tmany things more delicious in a book than belly laughs along with the sick andtwisted.... FILMS/MOVIESI loved Marathon Man with Dustin Hoffmanand Laurence Olivier, a film that always makes people wince and jab at theirteeth. I love American crime dramas from the early seventies. There issomething completely gritty and bleak about them, with no special effects butgreat acting.... TV DRAMASInspector Morse, just because it was amust-watch back in its heyday. Cracker too, with Robbie Coltrane, because itmade profiling burst on to the scene. Of recent years, The Missing was up therewith the best, and I enjoyed The Night Of. I enjoy most things with JohnTurturro.... FICTIONAL KILLERSI’m going to pick a really obvious one inHannibal Lecter, because he is a horrific human being but it’s hard not to rootfor him in some weird way.... MURDER WEAPONSHuman hands. Physical weapons can have agreat impact, but much less than the work done by human hands as the killerstares into the victim’s eyes? There is something more personal about it, forthe victim as well as the killer.I’m guessing that is the case, of course.I’ve no actual real-life experience of it. Honestly.     ... BLOGS/WEBSITESI don’t really follow any particularblogger as a matter of routine but will dip in and out when I spot somethinginteresting.I used to love the FBI website, and inparticular the scientific pages, where a writer could browse the latestforensic developments, although the site does seem to have scaled that back abit now.I could get lost in The Kennedy Assassination which has been a longstanding site dedicated to the JFK assassination, aimed atdebunking the various conspiracy theories. The site was around in the early daysof the internet, which wasn’t too long after the ridiculous Oliver Stone film,JFK. The site demolishes it.... WRITING TIPSStart it, write it, finish it. As simple asthat. If you spend time searching for online help in how to write, what you areactually doing is putting off the job of writing for fear of discovering youcan’t do it. If you write it first, you can look for resources to improve itonce you’ve finished it. If you’ve read books, you know how they work. Followyour instincts until what you put on the page sounds like something you’d paymoney for.And don’t try to be clever with the prose.Be lean. I once read a short story by someone for a competition I was judging,where the writer spent half a page describing the rain on the window. I thought,yeah, I get it, it’s raining. Contrast that with the opening line of Get Carterby Ted Lewis, which is “The rain rained”, in relation to a character staringout of a gloomy train window. Says so much more with so much less. About Neil WhiteNeil White wasborn and brought up around West Yorkshire. He left school at sixteen butreturned to education in his twenties, when he studied for a law degree. Hestarted writing in 1994, and is now a criminal lawyer by day, crime fictionwriter by night. He lives in the north of England with his wife and threechildren.Find Neil White on his website and follow him on Twitter - @neilwhite1965About From the ShadowsPublisher's descriptionHe hides in the shadows, watching, waiting,until the time is right . . . Mary Kendricks, a smart, pretty,twenty-four-year-old teacher, has been brutally murdered and Robert Carter isaccused of killing her.When defence lawyer, Dan Grant inheritsCarter's case only weeks before the trial starts, everyone expects him just tobabysit it, but Dan's not that kind of lawyer. He'll follow the evidence -wherever it takes him.But as Dan and his investigator Jayne Brettlook into the case, they discover that there is more to it than meets the eye.In order to do their jobs they need to push the limits of the system, even ifit means putting themselves in danger.Together they will get to the truth -whatever the cost . . .From the Shadows is published by Zaffre in e-book on 9 March 2017 and in paperback on 10 August 2017. Look out for more BEST OF CRIME features coming soon.Click here to read more BEST OF CRIME features."},
{"title": "The Perfect Girl by Gilly Macmillan", "date": "Friday 3 March 2017", "text": "The Perfect GirlBy Gill MacmillanPublished by Piatkus (22 September 2016)ISBN: 978-0349406428Publisher's descriptionTo everyonewho knows her now, Zoe Maisey - child genius, musical sensation - is perfect.Yet several years ago Zoe caused the death of three teenagers. She served hertime, and now she's free. Her storybegins with her giving the performance of her life.Bymidnight, her mother is dead.My verdictThe Perfect Girl is a fascinating portrayal of Zoe, a gifted teenager whose tragic past haunts her every waking moment. It's also a whodunnit, investigating the death of Zoe's mother.This is a very intense read, with a strong focus on characterisation, as the story is narrated from the perspective of several different characters. It's beautifully written with vivid descriptions and powerful dialogue. The short chapters keep up the fast pace, while drip-feeding little snippets of information about not only Zoe's past but also her step-father and step-brother. There are several dark themes, including family secrets, domestic violence and teenage bullying.The book is very enjoyable, although it didn't quite thrill me in the same way as the author's first book, Burnt Paper Sky. I found The Perfect Girl to be more of a slow burning study of family dynamics, and how one tragic mistake can influence your future. It's certainly emotional and full of surprises, and leaves you thinking.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher."},

And I really admire the way that Tarantino doesn’t flinch from themess of violence – Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta cleaning out theircar has to be one of the best aftermath scenes ever. You can view that scene here.... TV DRAMASI was obsessed by TheBridge, and more recently completely blown away by Unforgotten S2 – the way it took its themes so seriously. But myfavourite is Happy Valley, just becauseit is so bloody brilliant. And because it has real, middle aged women withcomplicated family stuff in their lives who still manage to do proper importantjobs. ... FICTIONAL KILLERSYou can’t really beat Hannibal Lecter, can you? Educated, areal match for his victims and pursuers, a fully rounded character with agourmet penchant for human flesh. I’ve read the books, seen the TV series, andI’m still fascinated.... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESI really enjoy Sarah Hilary’s Marnie Rome – in a genrepopulated by troubled middle aged male detectives, it’s great to encounter a complicated,youngish woman whose own difficult background keeps on insisting on intrudinginto her work and personal life. ... MURDER WEAPONSI did Marlowe’s EdwardII for A Level, and I’ve never got the manner of his death out of mytwisted mind. If you don’t know what happened, I’m not going to pollute yourbrain by going into it in detail, but I’ll just say that the weapons involvedwere a table, a horn and a red hot poker... In my own books, I’m particularlyproud of the manner of Gareth’s death in Cuckoo,which has led to the book being described as ‘a nasty Aga saga’. … DEATH SCENESSorry to go back to the theatre (it’s my background,dahling), but it has to be the deaths of Romeo and Juliet. It’s such abrilliant device – every single time I’ve seen the play, I’ve willed it not tohappen. But Shakespeare pretty much aced it at death – my husband wrote anddirected a play with a company called Spymonkey that catalogued all 74 onstagedeaths in his works.The arch gory death play has to be Titus Andronicus,with mothers eating their sons baked into pies, fathers killing daughters,tongues being cut out, a live burial… And they say that modern crime fiction istoo gory! I have to say, though, that there are scenes in both Bret EastonEllis’s American Psycho and ChuckPalahniuk’s work – notably the swimming pool thing in Guts – that I wish I had never read.... BLOGS/WEBSITESI belong toa top-secret Facebook group of fellow crime writers. Between us we have a widerange of specialist knowledge, and the deal is we help each other out. It hasbeen invaluable to me in many, many ways. But if I gave out the address, theywould have to kill me. So...the website I can list is Chuck Wendig'sTerrible Minds. (don't go there if you areoffended by swearing!!!) He makes me realise I am not alone, and, I am certainthat, behind the scary, sweary facade, he is incredibly generous, warm andwise....

The only question is will Louisa lether?My verdictHer Husband's Lover is a twisty psychological thriller.The plot, with two determined and unstable women at its heart, is compelling and unsettling. Filled with betrayal, jealousy and dark secrets, it totally played with my mind. The writing is sharp, with strong characterisation and several interwoven threads. I wasn't sure who to trust or whether anyone could be trusted.Her Husband's Lover is cleverly written, changing direction more than once. It's a slow burner - a character-led book rather than a plot-driven one, with two unreliable narrators to confuse the reader. I don't often start reading a book with one view of certain characters and reach the disturbing ending with a totally different one. But that's exactly how Her Husband's Lover affected me. It's very well done, with so many red herrings and distorted truths.I received an Advance Reader Copy.First Monday Crime - March 2017Julia Crouch will be on the First Monday Crime panel on 6 March 2017.

{"title": "Stasi Wolf by David Young - Blog Tour review", "date": "Tuesday 28 February 2017", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for Stasi Wolf by David Young. Stasi Wolf was published by Zaffre on 9 February 2017. Read on for my review...Stasi WolfBy David YoungPublished by Zaffre (9 February 2017)ISBN: 978-1785760686Publisher's descriptionEastGermany, 1975. Karin Müller, sidelined from the murder squad in Berlin, jumpsat the chance to be sent south to Halle-Neustadt, where a pair of infant twinshave gone missing.But Müllersoon finds her problems have followed her. Halle-Neustadt is a new town - thepride of the communist state - and she and her team are forbidden by the Stasifrom publicising the disappearances, lest they tarnish the town's flawlessimage.Meanwhile,in the eerily nameless streets and tower blocks, a child snatcher lurks, andthe clock is ticking to rescue the twins alive . . .My verdictStasi Wolf is yet another great police procedural thriller from David Young. It's gripping and well paced, with a good mix of action and tension, and an authentic multi-layered plot.This is the second book in his Karin Müller 'Stasi' series. It's not essential to read his first book, Stasi Child, before this one, as Stasi Wolf provides all the background you need. But I definitely think it's worth doing so - firstly, as an introduction to the characters and setting, but secondly, because it's highly enjoyable too.Like the first book in the series, Stasi Wolf has a fascinating well-researched setting in terms of historical, social and political climate. The bleakness and claustrophobia of East Germany are very well described. In Stasi Germany, it's difficult to conduct an investigation when everything has to be surrounded by secrecy. Yet detective Karin Müller isn't afraid to look outside the box and take risks, even against Stasi orders, to solve a case. She's a complex character, with her personal background developing as this series progresses, giving her an emotional side that often leads her to clash with her superiors.In Stasi Wolf, Müller's case involves missing twins - which becomes very unsettling and very personal. As several plot strands gradually weave together to tie up loose ends, not only does this provide an insight into her past, but also raises questions about her future. I'm looking forward to David Young's next instalment.I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Read on for my review.The Witchfinder's SisterBy Beth UnderdownPublished by Viking (2 March 2017)ISBN: 978-0241978030Publisher's description'The numberof women my brother Matthew killed, so far as I can reckon it, is one hundredand six...'1645. WhenAlice Hopkins' husband dies in a tragic accident, she returns to the smallEssex town of Manningtree, where her brother Matthew still lives.But home isno longer a place of safety. Matthew has changed, and there are rumoursspreading through the town: whispers of witchcraft, and of a great book, inwhich he is gathering women's names.To whatlengths will Matthew's obsession drive him?And whatchoice will Alice make, when she finds herself at the very heart of his plan?My verdictI really enjoyed The Witchfinder's Sister. I found the book to be highly atmospheric with very realistic narrative and dialogue in keeping with the time period in which it's set. It starts off slowly, building up the suspense until it becomes a twisty page turner that's difficult to put down.The story centres around Alice Hopkins, recently widowed sister of Matthew, who was an English witch hunter, mainly in East Anglia. Due her own circumstances, Alice becomes trapped in her brother's home and is reliant on him for food and lodging. Soon she discovers that her brother is a monster with no heart - and that he expects her to join his quest to find witches. Does Alice have a choice?It's not an easy read, in terms of content, and is certainly not uplifting. But it's not meant to be. Instead, it's a fascinating and gripping tale of a time when women could be arrested for witchcraft, incarcerated and hanged, just because a man viewed them with irrational suspicion. The plot is claustrophobic, vivid and oozes tension and unease.The Witchfinder's Sister is perfect for historical fiction fans who like well-researched books with a gruesome, and slightly supernatural, theme. Highly recommended.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": " Some Thoughts on Write or Wrong by Marilyn Messik", "date": "Friday 24 February 2017", "text": "I would like to welcome author Marilyn Messik on my blog today too talk about writing. Marilyn's second book Even Stranger was published by Troubador Publishing on 25 April 2016.Some thoughts on write or wrong!By Marilyn MessikSuccess on a plate – Fat Chance!Wouldn’t it be nice if writing success came with aneatly set-out instruction book? One that laid down a step by step route, for usto follow the yellow brick road to the pot of gold, the six-figure publishingdeal?Truth is, such an instruction book or writingcourse doesn’t really exist although, like happy-ever-after-endings, the toothfairy and anti-ageing creams we’d all like to believe they do. But don’t letyourself be put off. I’m just pointing out that success is a mixture of hardwork, dogged determination, a small slice of luck, faith in yourself and aboveall, enjoyment in what you’re doing. And in case you think I’m heading for thespiritual and suggesting you put it out to the universe – I should just say,that’s not my way of thinking either. When spirituality was handed out I was inthe toilet. I also missed tall and willowy but we won’t go into that now. I’mstrictly for the practical approach!Will these ruminations help you?Well, all I can say with complete certainty is,like chicken soup, they certainly won’t do you any harm. The fact of the matteris, you can be told all sorts of things you need to know, but in the long runit’s how you take that information and make it your own, that counts. In the long run there are no guarantees. Sometimeswe can be given all the ingredients for a superb cake, together with an idiot-proofrecipe. Some efforts will turn out impeccably, others won’t! My belief thoughis that you should always bear in mind, as with most things, there is no absoluteright or wrong, there are only opinions and whilst the opinions of some expertswill fit well with yours, others will not. Don’t try to mould yourself to a wayof working or an approach that doesn’t sit well. If it feels wrong for you,then it almost certainly is. Trust your own instincts and gut feelings. Theyusually push you in the direction which will work for you and on the occasionsthey don’t – well, we have to take the rough with the smooth don’t we? The onething of which I am convinced is that some of the time you just have to shutyour eyes, fly by the seat of your pants, cross everything that can be crossed andhope for the best. Short and sweet is often the safest routeLet me give you a practical example of what I mean:Pictureif you will:Handsomeprince.Highstone tower. Windowat the top. Beautiful girl. Hecalls, ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.’Shedoes. He climbs.Unfortunately,Rapunzel’s had hair extensions. Nota happy ending after all!Just 38 words. But as you read those 38 words,couldn’t you see each stage of the story? That’s clear communication. Somethingthat’s gone straight from my head to yours. I feel any writing worth its saltshould come across with the same sort of clarity. If we analyse it, that smallstory works because it’s: Familiar: traditional fairy tale, instantlyrecognisable characters.    Simple: it’s not exactly a convoluted plot, so - instantcomprehension. Visual: every phrase paints a picture.Brief: there’s no waffle.  Funny: that’s the icing on the cake! I think it’s a great set of principles to applyyour writing, whether fiction or fact. What are your thoughts?   About Marilyn MessikMarilyn wasa regular feature and fiction writer for national magazines when her childrenwere small. She set up her first business, selling toys, books and party goods,from home, before opening first one shop then another.

Of course - and she's the first toadmit - she'd be a lot better off if she could ditch the conviction that shealways knows best. This shortcoming, combined with a chronic inability to keepher mouth shut and her nose out of other people's business, has led her off thestraight and narrow more than once. But Stella's perfectly clear how things aregoing to be from now on. It's not she can't handle sticky situations, she can,she just doesn't want to - violence really isn't her thing. Forward planningincludes setting herself up in a successful business, sticking like glue tonormal, squashing an over-active conscience and steering clear of anythingremotely risky or unpleasant. Unfortunately, the best laid plans often lead tothe darkest places...Even Stranger is a darker tale of fantastic occurrencesthat will appeal to fans of authors such as Stephen King, and Marilyn's firstnovel, Relatively Strange.You can find Even Stranger on Amazon UK here."},

AUTHORSI absolutely lovecrime fiction, and I love seeing what my fellow writers do with the infinitepossibilities of telling a story about killing. I’d say Val McDermid, StellaDuffy, and John Harvey are amongst my favourites.  But I’ll go for Walter Mosley. He pushes atthe boundaries of possibility in the genre, whilst absolutely owning it. Hisbooks are page-turning stories, with emotional truth and great poetry.... FILMS/MOVIESOdd Man Out. Made in1947, it’s a nail-biting thriller and a very dark tale, but with a huge heartand a fantastically talented cast too.... TV DRAMASThe Missing. I got fedup with compulsively watchable TV series where the final ending wasunbelievable – where the story was so ramped up that the denouement couldn’tpossibly measure up.  But the Missing I’vestuck with loyally and been rewarded. The acting, the story structure, and the world it inhabits – allbelievable and extremely well written.... FICTIONAL KILLERSThis is a difficultone. Most killers, as any police officer will tell you, kill for very straightforwardreasons. So there’s already a challenge in making a killer believable.  Agatha Christie, for all her unlikelypuzzle-based plotting, makes it so that when the murderer is unmasked, it allsomehow makes sense.  ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESSimenon’s Maigret, forbeing the still silent centre of the story. ... MURDER WEAPONSIt’s amazing how muchtime we perfectly ordinary crime writers go about our daily lives thinkingabout ways of killing people. Most of my characters grab the nearest weapon, aswe all would. Wouldn’t we?  But I do likethe (spoiler alert) bellrope snake in Conan Doyle’s Holmes story, The SpeckledBand.    ... BLOGS/WEBSITESKiller Women.  I know I’m a member, but Killer Women is justthe most fab group of women crime writers and I’m proud to spread the word.... WRITING TIPSI’ve had the privilege of teaching onvarious creative writing courses over the years, and what I’ve learnt is thatthere isn’t a ‘right’ way of writing a crime story.  Of course the structure is extremelyimportant, and I do tend to work on that before I do the actual writing of thenovel. I think it’s like a game of patience, or solitaire – the whole plot canbe happily unfolding and I can be feeling very clever, and then suddenly it’squite clear that it doesn’t make sense, that my murderer’s motivation iscompletely unbelievable and stupid, and it’s like a key card is stuck underthe heap and I have to start again.But the heart of thestory, the truth of the characters – I don’t really know where that comes from.I think acting and writing are very connected,  that there is some kind of being someone elsethat happens when I’m working on a character.About Alison JosephAlison Joseph is a crime writer and radioplaywright, former Chair of the Crime Writers’ Association, and founding memberof Killer Women.

Assigned to the shocking case areDetective William 'Wolf' Fawkes, recently reinstated to the London Met, and hisformer partner Detective Emily Baxter.The'Ragdoll Killer' taunts the police by releasing a list of names to the media,and the dates on which he intends to murder them. With six people to save, canFawkes and Baxter catch a killer when the world is watching their every move?My verdictRagdoll's opening scene is intended to not just grab your attention but to leave you shocked and somewhat disturbed. And it certainly achieves that, with gruesome descriptions of body parts from six victims connected together to form a 'ragdoll'.With its macabre deaths (graphic in places) and a very dark multi-layered plot, Ragdoll isn't for the faint-hearted. It's cleverly plotted, with a passionate yet damaged detective and a cat and mouse game to save lives. The twists and turns keep on coming, right until the bitter end. I admit that certain aspects of the plot were a little far-fetched for me, but I just had to go with the flow. To be honest, there was little time to breathe, let alone think. You can tell that the author's background involves script writing.I love crime fiction dripping with humour, horror and unpredictability. I like to be frightened, challenged and wowed. Ragdoll ticked all the boxes. A gripping, intriguing and fast paced rollercoaster ride, this book certainly doesn't read like a debut.This is the first in a series, and I definitely want to know what's next!I received an Advance Reader Copy.First Monday Crime, March 2017Daniel Cole will be on the First Monday Crime panel on 6 March 2017.

Because I Was Lonely is being published by RedDoor Publishing on 2 March 2017. Read on for my review...Because I Was LonelyBy Hayley MitchellPublished by RedDoor Publishing (2 March 2017)ISBN: 978-1910453292Publisher's descriptionMeetRachel. She is caught in a spiral of endless crying, dirty nappies, andsleepless nights. She fears for her sanity and the safety of her children.She'slonely.Meet Adam.Suffering from the pain and trauma of a terrible accident that he blameshimself for, he stays at home, unable to bring himself to leave the house.He'slonely.So whenRachel and Adam rekindle their long lost friendship online, what starts as alittle harmless flirtation, soon becomes an unhealthy obsession, and slowly thethreads of their lives unravel before them.Four lonelypeople . Two unhappy marriages . One dangerous, but inevitable climax.My verdictBecause I Was Lonely reads like a book of two halves.The first half is an introduction to the characters, with every detail of their lives put under the microscope. The author certainly has a knack for in-depth characterisation. I really felt like I knew each character by the time the story itself began.Because I Was Lonely highlights post natal depression and the loneliness it can cause, especially if there's a lack of help when it's needed most, and how this can impact on relationships. Rachel, as a new mother, was portrayed very realistically. It was interesting to read her husband David's point of view too. Then there was Adam and Julia's story. Adam, an old friend of Rachel, is suffering with severe mental health issues after a tragic accident and his marriage is also falling apart.Starting the book off in this way did, I felt, slow down the pace. Yet having seen some great reviews, I knew I had to keep reading to find out where this story was going. And I would urge others to do the same.Around halfway through the book, the present day story began and the pace picked up. The characters' lives collided when Rachel and Adam found each other on Facebook. And they certainly collided with a huge bang. The narrative was tense and unsettling, as Rachel and Adam began to send messages to one another and their feelings escalated. I was nervous, worrying how this would end.If you like loose ends tied up in the books you read, you may be a bit frustrated. The book ends on a cliffhanger, with many questions remaining unanswered, and makes me wonder if a sequel is on the way.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Cursed is published in paperback by Orenda Books today (15 February 2017). Read on for my review...CursedBy Thomas EngerPublished by Orenda Books (15 February 2017)ISBN: 978-1910633649Publisher's descriptionWhen HeddaHellberg fails to return from a retreat in Italy, where she has recently beengrieving for her dead father, her husband discovers that her life is tangled inmystery. Hedda never left Oslo, the retreat has no record of her and, what'smore, she appears to be connected to the murder of an old man, gunned down onthe first day of the hunting season in the depths of the Swedish forests...My verdictCursed is a slow burning atmospheric Nordic Noir crime novel that builds up to a dramatic conclusion. It covers several dark themes, including grief, revenge, loss and family secrets.Journalist Nora and her former partner Henning are dealing with the tragic death of their young son in different ways. Nora is trying to move on with her life, putting all of her energy into her work - focusing on the disappearance of an old friend, Hedda Hellberg. Henning isn't coping so well though. He's obsessed with discovering who lit the fire that killed their son, and is prepared to take extreme measures as he searches for the answers.Although Cursed is part of a series, it can definitely be read as a standalone. It's well written, with some vivid descriptive prose and well-developed characters, and the multi-layered plot is intelligent, tense and gripping. It didn't take long for me to become immersed in the secrets of the Hellberg family and how they could be linked to the death of an old man in the Swedish forests.For me, this book was all about surprises, from the subtle turns to the final shocking twist. It's certainly left me intrigued to read more.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "My writing and editing process by Dinah Jefferies - Before the Rains Blog Tour", "date": "Tuesday 14 February 2017", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Dinah Jefferies to my blog today to talk about her writing and editing process for her Blog Tour. Before the Rains is being published by Viking on 23 February 2017.My writing and editing processBy Dinah JefferiesI’m going to tell you about my own process of writing andediting, but please remember that everybody has their own way. The main thingwe all have in common, is that any published novel will be the result of agroup of people working on it as a team. I’ve found that as I write more books the process changes,so really nothing is constant. For me the most difficult and sometimes painfulpart is getting the first draft down. During this period, I feel very much on myown. I may or may not have a contract to write a particular book, but it makesno difference, I am still faced with the task of writing approximately 100,000words and, if I have a deadline, I often write even when I don’t feel like. Itcan be tough. I write new chapters in the mornings and catch up with research,emails, Q&As, and write blogs like this, in the afternoons. I can’t work atnight as I run out of energy and, by then, my eyes and brain have had enoughscreen time.I try to write the first draft quickly, because once thebasis of the story is down I can then begin to dig deeper. I often don’t even knowwhat I’ve got until somebody else sees it, and that first person is usually myagent, Caroline Hardman. She’s a terrific agent who’ll come back with essentialfeedback and it’s often only then that I begin to see the wider themes of thenovel. The feedback can be quite surprising but this is when the first realediting begins. This is where the glaring issues are dealt with. For The SilkMerchant’s Daughter, I agreed with my agent that I would cut two point of viewcharacters, and that meant cutting 49,000 words. Not a happy experience. ForBefore The Rains, I just had to add three chapters, so it’s different every time.I do enjoy the editing, because I feel I can really get to grips with the novelonce I have a better idea of where I am.Once this stage is complete, the manuscript goes to myeditor, Venetia Butterfield, publishing director of Viking/Penguin. She willwant to put her own stamp on the book and will usually come back to me withinthree or four weeks. She’s very experienced and I completely trust herjudgement but, if I don’t agree with something, we’ll talk it over and reach acompromise. For Before The Rains, she suggested a final chapter I hadn’tpreviously considered. Her editorial suggestions are usually focused oncharacterisation, plot weakness, or maybe certain aspects of the story thatneed drawing out more fully. Once these edits are finished, the copyeditor gets her handson the script. This is when the nitty gritty of punctuation, any inconsistences,or timeline issues are dealt with, and I have to agree or disagree with all herproposed changes. Finally the page proofs arrive. They come to me and two otherproof readers, and it’s amazing what tiny things you still find. So that’s myprocess of writing and editing. I love the pulling and shaping of a story totry to get the very best out of it. That’s what we all try to do and wecouldn’t do it without a team behind us.About Dinah JefferiesDinah Jefferies was born in Malaysia but moved to England at the age of nine, travelling widely throughout her life and always maintaining a love of Southeast Asia. She spent time living in a musicians' commune, and has had work publicly exhibited as an artist.

All the Missing Girls was published by Atlantic Books (Corvus) on 2 February 2017. Read on for my review...All the Missing GirlsBy Megan MirandaPublished by Atlantic Books (2 February 2017)ISBN: 978-1786490810Publisher's descriptionIt's beenten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her bestfriend, Corinne, disappeared without trace. Then a letter from her fatherarrives - 'I need to talk to you. That girl. I saw that girl.' Has her father'sdementia worsened, or has he really seen Corinne? Returning home, Nicolettemust finally face what happened on that terrible night all those years ago.Then, another young woman goes missing, almost to the day of the anniversary ofwhen Corinne vanished. And like ten years ago, the whole town is a suspect.Told backwards - Day 15 to Day 1 - Nicolette works to unravel the truth,revealing shocking secrets about her friends, her family, and what reallyhappened to Corinne.My verdictAll the Missing Girls features two mysteries (10 years apart), both involving the disappearance of two girls in a small rural town in the USA. Although the book opens and closes in the present day, the main part of the story is told backwards, from Day 15 to Day 1. The ending of the book is really the beginning of the story.I found myself immersed in the narrative from early on. The setting is highly atmospheric, and there were plenty of believable characters, although I can't say I liked any of them. This is a great study of small town America, in a town filled with secrets and lies.Each chapter/day reveals more facts about the disappearance of Nicolette's friend Corinne 10 years earlier and gets closer to the truth. The author cleverly dripfeeds the clues, with a slow reveal of Nicolette's haunting memories of that time. I gave up trying to figuring everything out, not only because of the twists and turns, but also because the format of the book made it more difficult to guess. This made the ending, with the truth finally revealed, very unexpected.All the Missing Girls was an enjoyable and gripping read, with some fast-paced moments and plenty of tension.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Follow the Blog Tour"},

The body of a young boy is discovered with similar wounds toLinnea's.BuchenwaldConcentration Camp, 1944. In the midst of the hell of the Holocaust, ErichHebner will do anything to see himself as a human again.Are the twomurders the work of a serial killer, and how are they connected to shockingevents at Buchenwald?Emily Roy,a profiler on loan to Scotland Yard from the Canadian Royal Mounted Police,joins up with Linnea's friend, French truecrime writer Alexis Castells, toinvestigate the puzzling case. They travel between Sweden and London, and thendeep into the past, as a startling and terrifying connection comes to light.My verdictBlock 46 is very 'Orenda Crime', with short chapters, beautiful writing and a compelling fast-paced plot. It's been translated seamlessly from the original French by Maxim Jakubowski. I loved the plot, characters and setting, and I'm not surprised that Block 46 has won awards in France.Shocking and dark from the outset, the book begins with the death of a young jewellery designer who splits her time between London and Sweden. When a young boy's body is discovered with similar wounds, it seems that there is a calculating serial killer on the loose - one whose passion for murder may be linked to the 1940s Buchenwald Concentration Camp in Germany.I was so intrigued to see where Block 46 was going. Yet after just a few pages, I had to put the book down for a while, needing a break. I desperately wanted to read more, but also didn't. Those who know me well will know that books don't often have such an impact on me. And not many books make me email a publisher with the expression 'OMG'!The murder scenes are gruesome - no holds barred - and really get under your skin. But for me, it was the Holocaust scenes that were the most visual and disturbing, with graphic and hard hitting descriptions of tragic scenes that could have, and probably did, happen in Nazi Germany. These scenes may seem exaggerated to some people, but sadly I knew they were realistic, having read many Holocaust books and listened to testimonies of Holocaust survivors.Block 46 contains everything I want in crime fiction, including twists, turns and surprises. It totally broke me for a while at the end and is certainly not a book that I'll forget. I sat thinking about it for a long time afterwards and couldn't pick up another book straight away. I was worried that I would never be able to read again. Sadly I don't tend to read 'light and fluffy' so just had to wait for my reading mojo to return.Perfect for those who like intelligent hard hitting crime with a hint of horror, Block 46 is chilling, creepy and spine tingling. Brilliant! And the best news of all is that it's the start of a series, so there's another one on the way!I received an Advance Reader Copy.I am delighted to be today's stop on the Corpus Blog Tour.

Narrow and cobbled with a half-timbered tavern, which must have beenold when Otto von Bismarck was young. She looked around once more. The streetwas almost deserted, save for a boy of about twelve. She stopped three housesto the left of the tavern, outside the front door of a three-storey building. Numbersix, one of the flats at the top of the house. She pressed the button twice,waited three seconds, then pressed again.A dormer window opened twenty feet above herand a face peered out. ‘Ja?’‘Guten tag, OnkelArnold!’He hesitated no more than two seconds, thennodded. ‘Einen moment, bitte.’Half a minute later, the front door opened.‘Come in,’ he whispered. His English washeavily accented, but precise. He was a balding man in his mid-thirties and hewas frightened.Nancy stepped into the gloom of the hallway. Oneither side of her there were doors to apartments. In front of her was astaircase. ‘Here?’ she suggested.‘No, please, not here. Come upstairs.’As soon as he had closed the door to his flat,she removed her hat and tossed it on the table. Then she opened her bag andtook out a brown envelope. She thrust it at him. ‘It’s all in there.’He slid the papers out and studied them, thengave her a strained smile. It would take a great deal more than this deliveryof forged papers to wash away the stresses of his life. ‘Thank you, miss.Truly, I don’t know how to thank you or repay you. You have risked a great dealfor me.’‘Not for you, for the cause.’‘I thank you all the same. Can I make you a cupof tea? Or coffee perhaps? It is ersatz, I’m afraid.’‘No, I must go.’ She hesitated. She wasshaking. ‘Do you have a lavatory?’‘Yes, it is shared. Across the landing.’No, not here. It would be too risky. She had toget to safety. She tried to control her shakes. ‘Forget it. I have to leavenow.’‘I think if you were really my niece you wouldstay a little while, don’t you? Having walked all this way?’‘No one saw me coming.’‘My landlord would have seen and heard youringing the bell and calling out my name. He sees everything.’‘I’ll stay ten minutes.’ Nancy took a grip ofherself. ‘I am thirsty. Perhaps you have something a little stronger than tea?’‘Peach schnapps. It is the only alcohol I have,I’m afraid.’She made a face. ‘Better than nothing.’They sat together in the man’s sweltering,badly furnished sitting room, the ceiling sloping acutely beneath the eaves.The open window let in only warm, dirty air. Arnold Lindberg was a physicsprofessor from Göttingen, but in this house he was Arnold Schmidt, unemployedlibrarian. She could smell the sweat of his fear. His pate was glistening andthere were beads of perspiration on his brow and on his upper lip. He lit acigarette and she could see that his fingers were trembling. As anafterthought, he thrust the packet towards her, but she shook her head. ‘Aglass of water,’ she said. The sugary-sweet peach schnapps stood on the tablein front of her, untouched. Perhaps she could wash it down.He went to the basin and filled a glass. Shedrank it quickly, then asked for another.‘So tell me, miss, what do you think of the newGermany?’‘You mean the National Socialists?’‘Who else?’ He gave a hollow laugh. ‘Butplease, do not name them.’Don’t say the devil’s name for fear that hemight think you are calling him. ‘I loathe them,’ she said. ‘That’s why I’mhere.’ At last, she threw back the schnapps. It was not as sweet as she hadfeared.

{"title": "Working with herbs by Su Bristow - Sealskin Blog Tour", "date": "Monday 6 February 2017", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Su Bristow to my blog today for the Sealskin blog tour, to talk about working with herbs. Sealskin is being published in paperback by Orenda Books on 15 February 2017. You can read my review here.Working with herbsBy Su BristowWhen Ifirst qualified as a medical herbalist, I was living in a small village onDartmoor. Although it was a much more open community than the one I’vedescribed in Sealskin, some of the same rules apply. There’s a very efficientbush telegraph! If I hadn’t managed to help my first few patients, my practicewould never have got off the ground. Fortunately, I did, and that meant it grewfar more quickly than it would have done in a town or a city. My children wentto the village playgroup and school, and other mothers brought their childrento me. The local doctors knew me, and some of them are still my friends. Of course,there’s a darker side as well. Some people thought I was a foreigner, or awitch, or even (there are some very conservative Christians in rural Devon) inleague with the devil. Like Bridie, I sometimes met with suspicion anddistrust, although people would rarely make any direct challenge to your face.But the tradition of using herbs is still alive and well, especially amongfarmers treating their animals, and on the whole it was accepted and welcomed. I’ve beenin practice for thirty years now, and in that time I’ve met people from allwalks of life, and helped with everything from childbirth to allergies toauto-immune problems, from acute infections to cancer. But it’s not about theailments, really. Herbal medicine is a three-cornered relationship between thepatient, the herbalist and the herbs themselves. Plants are living beings withtheir own characters. Understanding that, and choosing the right herbs for theindividual, and herbs that will work together to feed their vital energy, is what it's all about. Forexample, everyone knows about Echinacea and its immune-boosting action, butthere are plenty of other herbs that help immunity in various ways, andEchinacea isn’t always the best herb for you, or for your particular symptompicture. Equally, a combination of herbs may be more effective than a singleherb on its own; Echinacea plus Elderflower and Yarrow for a cold, for example,or plus Thyme and Elecampane for a chest infection. Knowing how to balance theprescription is part of the art of herbal medicine, and you need that as well as the science.    But it’snot just about the herbs, and the wonderful support they have to offer. It’salso about being able to listen, and keep company with people who are indistress. In traditional tribal medicine, which I studied at university beforeI ever thought of becoming a herbalist, there’s a lot of ceremony that goesalong with the medicines given to sick people; and that, sometimes more thanthe medicine, helps to give them the strength they need to get well. Here’s alink to a performance of Nkisi, a monologue I wrote about a shamanic journey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v58E0euZrukInSealskin, Bridie is named for the Celtic goddess Brigid, patron of childbirth,healing, fire, poetry and unity. She was later Christianised into St Bride orSt Bridget, who was said to have been midwife to the Virgin Mary. I think alot of me went into the character of Bridie - or rather, me as I’d like to be.You’d have to ask my patients about that... About Su BristowSu Bristowis a consultant medical herbalist by day. She’s the author of two books onherbal medicine: The Herbal Medicine Chest and The Herb Handbook;and two on relationship skills: The Courage to Love and Falling inLove, Staying in Love, co-written with psychotherapist, Malcolm Stern. Herpublished fiction includes ‘Troll Steps’ (in the anthology, Barcelona toBihar), and ‘Changes’ which came second in the 2010 CreativeWritingMattersflash fiction competition.

In Sealskin, Su Bristow has brought the magic of this wonderful legend to life.When Donald, a young fisherman, sees selkies for the first time, he is overcome with emotion. He has no idea that his unexpected and shocking response will have life-changing repercussions, not just for him and his family but for his whole community.Sealskin is exquisitely written with haunting prose and evocative descriptions of the Scottish landscape. It's filled with beauty, surprises and subtle twists and turns. There's a mesmerising love story at its heart. But this book is far more than just a love story. It's about forgiveness, taking responsibility for our actions, planning for the future, standing up for what's right, overcoming our fears and being accepted by a tight-knit community that's not used to strangers. I could go on, but I'll let readers discover the many layers for themselves.I don't think there was a single character who didn't change somehow by the end of Sealskin. A whole community was bewitched by the magic. Just as I was.I tried to read Sealskin slowly, as I wanted the book to last, yet it was so compelling that I struggled to put it down.

{"title": "BEST OF CRIME with Sophie Hannah", "date": "Friday 3 February 2017", "text": "Welcome to a new feature on my blog called BEST OF CRIME, looking at crime writers' top picks, from their favourite author and fictional detective to their best writing tip. Today I'm delighted to welcome SOPHIE HANNAHto share her BEST OF CRIME... ... AUTHORSAgatha Christie.  I love her ingenuity, her ability tocreate and build suspense, those surreal, impossible-seeming plot premises andtheir total unguessability. Her books have a perfect simplicity of stylecombined with very complex plotting.  She was always looking toexpand the possibilities of the genre – I see her almost as aphilosopher of the crime novel!... FILMS/MOVIESTwelve Angry Men.  I first saw it when I was 12,and have watched it at least 20 times since. It will always be my top movie ofany genre. It’s a great jury room drama, with all but the first scene set in asingle room. The movie shows the best and the worst of human nature, and howour personal backgrounds and prejudices always influence our judgement. It’slargely dialogue based, with a fantastic script. Twelve Angry Men instilledin me a lifelong devotion to the ‘innocent until proved guilty’principle.  It’s not an exaggeration to call it work of genius. ... TV DRAMASI can’t choose between The Shield (cops and gangs inLA) and Sons of Anarchy (gangs and more gangs in California). Bothare massively underrated. Both are absolutely top-notch and addictive.  ... FICTIONAL KILLERSDexter Morgan (created by Jeff Lindsay). He’s a serialkiller who’s also a cop, and he's such a great character that I can’t helploving and feeling sorry for him, even though obviously I disapprove of hismurderous ways. ... FICTIONAL DETECTIVESWell, I can’t pick Poirot because I now write about him, sothat would feel wrong.  And I’ve mentioned Agatha Christie as my favouritecrime author already, so I won’t pick Miss Marple, though I adore her.  Anew private eye called Roxane Weary is brilliant – her first outing is in TheLast Place You Look by Kristen Lepionka, published by Faber in July. It isabsolutely brilliant. I want many more books starring Roxane Weary, please!... MURDER WEAPONSSpoiler alert! In The Little House by PhilippaGregory, a brilliant psychological thriller, the heroine arranges for her vilemother-in-law to be electrocuted by a faulty lawnmower. I loved the book andthe murder method – though, with murders, I’m generally more interested in the‘why’ than the ‘how’. I tend to murder people (in my own novels) infairly standard ways but for interesting reasons! … DEATH SCENESI’ve never forgotten a scene from PJ Tracey’s Want toPlay? At one point, the protagonists realise that a person who was wheeledpast them in a wheelchair earlier was actually a dead body being taken away bythe killer. It’s done in such a chilling way. ... BLOGS/WEBSITESRightmove. I get all the houses for my books from there!Also Twitter, where no one can hide their true self for very long.Twitter demonstrates every day how psychologically dysfunctional peopleare. You see intelligent, educated people calling others scum and telling themto eff off at first sign of disagreement. I used to think my characters wereoverly warped, self-serving and dysfunctional – then I discovered Twitter!... WRITING TIPSPlan first.  An architect wouldn’t build a housewithout drawing up the floor plans first to check that everything is inthe right place and the right order.  For me, the planning stage of anovel is every bit as creatively exciting as the writing of it.About Sophie HannahSophieHannah is an internationally bestselling writer of psychological crime fiction,published in 32 languages and 51 territories.  In 2014, with theblessing of Agatha Christie’s family and estate, Sophie published a new HerculePoirot novel, The Monogram Murders, which was a bestseller in morethan fifteen countries.  In September 2016, her second Poirot novel, ClosedCasket, was published and became an instant Sunday Times topten bestseller.In 2013,Sophie’s novel The Carrier won the Crime Thriller of the YearAward at the Specsavers National Book Awards.  Two of her crime novels, ThePoint of Rescue and The Other Half Lives, have been adapted fortelevision and appeared on ITV1 under the series title Case Sensitive in2011 and 2012. She is forty-five and lives with herhusband, children and dog in Cambridge, where she is a Fellow Commoner atLucy Cavendish College.About Closed CasketPublisher's descriptionHerculePoirot returns in another brilliant murder mystery that can only be solved bythe eponymous Belgian detective and his ‘little grey cells’.‘What Iintend to say to you will come as a shock . . .’LadyAthelinda Playford has planned a house party at her mansion in Clonakilty,County Cork, but it is no ordinary gathering.

The Damselfly is published TODAY by Black & White Publishing. Here's my review...The DamselflyBy SJI HollidayPublished by Black & White Publishing (2 February 2017)ISBN: 978-1785300875Publisher's descriptionAn unsolvedmurder. A community turned against each other. A killer close to home...Katie Taylor is the perfect student. Sheis bright, funny, and has a boyfriend who adores her. She’s just had a veryhandy windfall of cash, and there are only a few months left of school beforeshe can swap the small town of Banktounfor the bright lights of London. Butshe doesn’t make it that far...Because Katie is dead.Polly McAllister has left her husband andreturned to Banktoun to make amends. She wants to start afresh with the fatherof her unborn child – but she’s got to tell him, first. She’s thrown in at thedeep end with her job as school counsellor, and it’s not long before sheuncovers a multitude of murky secrets.Katie had enemies. Katie’s boyfriend is not so squeaky clean.DC Louise Jennings has a crush on a colleague: her new partner. Freshfrom training, Detective Sergeant DavieGray must work with Jennings to unravel the latest dark mystery in a town blighted by tragedy.Katie’s brother has a mysterious friend. But it’s OK. He’s only imaginary. Isn’t he?With the community enveloped in angryturmoil, Gray and Jennings must find out who murdered Katie, beforesomeone takes matters into their own hands.Trial by social media. A baying mob.But they’ve got the wrong man...Because the real killer is closer than you think.My verdictThe Damselfly is intense, unsettling, gripping and dark. I loved the first two books in the Banktoun series - Black Wood and Willow Walk - and have found each book to be even better than the last. This could easily be read as a standalone but I would recommend them all.Yet again, the author tackles everyday contemporary issues, this time focusing on teenage lives in a small Scottish town. The story is narrated by several voices - all are believable yet with very different points of view. Each character has their own backstory, which creates a multi-layered plot. I love how the author takes some characters from her previous books - it's like coming back to some old friends each time. I certainly love Sergeant Davie Gray!The book played with my mind and kept me guessing all the way through. It's a rollercoaster read, right until the shocking heart-stopping ending. But of course, it's not just about twists and turns. The Damselfly is well written and well plotted, with an atmospheric small town feel.The Damselfly is the last book in the series - but I'm (really) hoping we'll see some of these characters again. I 'may' have to stalk/badger/bribe/plead with the author just to make sure (or at least try)!I received an Advance Reader CopyFollow the Blog Tour"},

Then Reelingfrom a violent break-in, Emma wants a home where she feels safe. Nowhere isquite right until the agent suggests One Folgate Street: ‘It’s not a place thatwould suit everyone, the landlord is very particular...’ The house isextraordinary, breathtaking but it comes with a set of rules enforced by theenigmatic architect owner. Emma promises her boyfriend Simon that everythingwill be different when they move in.Now Jane islooking for a fresh start and the blank canvas of One Folgate Street seems to offer just that. Not to mention that the architect Edward Monkton is rather attractive. But once she moves in strange things begin to happen and Emma’s past andJane’s present become inexorably entwined. My verdictThe Girl Before is another psychological thriller being compared with The Girl on the Train and Gone Girl. The narrative alternates between two vulnerable women: Emma in the past and Jane in the present. The link between them is One Folgate Street, a hi-tech house with strict rules set by the architect who designed and owns the property. At times it felt as if the house itself was alive, monitoring its occupants and hiding secrets from its past.The mystery element of the book was great, as Jane sets out to discover what happened to Emma, the girl who lived in the house before her. I was intrigued after the first few pages and found the short chapters easy to read. I didn't particularly like any of the characters, but this is certainly a twisted tale with a interesting plot and several surprises.The only aspect of the book I wasn't so keen on was the dominant nature of the main male character. These two women were completely under Edward Monkton's spell, providing more than a hint of Christian Grey. As with 50 Shades, I couldn't grasp what these women saw in the architect (other than money and 'no commitment' sex, obviously) as there was nothing pleasant about him at all.I think this is a book that will appeal to the masses. I can understand why this has been snapped up by Hollywood. The combination of the architecture, hi tech property and sexual nature means it will be perfect for the big screen - but I hope they focus on the plot more than the '50 shades' element.Follow the Blog Tour.

The plot darkened as the book progressed, with flashbacks to events in the past that explored the relationship between Lena and her younger sister Kat.This is the second book in the DC Childs series. Although I have read the first book (In Bitter Chill), I do believe this can easily be read as a standalone.

The fact that it's taken so long for me to get through it is certainly no reflection on the quality of the writing or my enjoyment of the stories. Sadly life (and other books) just kept getting in the way.I admit that I'm not usually one for short story collections. I tend to read full length novels, not even novellas. But having entered a reading slump recently, I realised it was time to get stuck into this anthology again. And this was the best thing I could have done. It was so easy to dip into whenever there was a spare moment and I could read a whole story at a time, feeling a sense of completion at the end.The Killer Women are an incredibly talented bunch of women. The stories in their collection are all very different, providing something for everyone. These twisted tales are full of shocks, surprises and dark humour. Some are chilling, some are creepy, some are stomach churning and some are totally offbeat and 'laugh out loud' reads.The Killer Women: Crime Club Anthology #1 is a fantastic introduction to 15 amazing authors and offers the reader great value for money.

Here's my review (plus details of a giveaway at the end) ...RuptureBy Ragnar JónassonTranslated by Quentin BatesPublished by Orenda Books (15 January 2017)ISBN: 978-1910633571Publisher's description1955. Twoyoung couples move to the uninhabited, isolated fjord of Hedinsfjörður. Theirstay ends abruptly when one of the women meets her death in mysteriouscircumstances. The case is never solved. Fifty years later an old photographcomes to light, and it becomes clear that the couples may not have been aloneon the fjord after all… In nearbySiglufjörður, young policeman Ari Thór tries to piece together what reallyhappened that fateful night, in a town where no one wants to know, wheresecrets are a way of life. He's assisted by Ísrún, a news reporter in Reykjavikwho is investigating an increasingly chilling case of her own. Things take asinsister turn when a child goes missing in broad daylight. With a stalker onthe loose, and the town of Siglufjörður in quarantine, the past might just comeback to haunt them.My verdictI love this Dark Iceland series and believe that Rupture may possibly be the most intriguing so far.Rupture is set in a small Icelandic community, which becomes quarantined (and even more isolated than usual) when a deadly virus strikes at its heart. Stranded by the epidemic, Ari Thór begins to investigate a 60-year-old cold case of poisoning at a remote fjord, looking for a mysterious young man in a old photograph. He seeks the help of Isrun, a news reporter in Reykjavik (first introduced in Blackout), who is investigating a hit and run and the disappearance of a young child.Rupture is chilling, atmospheric and very readable (beautifully translated by Quentin Bates). I whizzed through it in just a few hours - totally captivated by the vivid descriptions of the Icelandic setting and daily life and haunted by the suspicious death of the past.Yet again, as with all Dark Iceland books, there are several seemingly unconnected strands. They flowed alongside one another until they gradually began to weave together, creating a tapestry of deception and lies. There was more than a hint of Agatha Christie within the plot, especially as Ari Thór gathered everyone together for the final reveal. I believe these Dark Iceland books will feature on classic crime fiction reading lists for decades to come.I have one copy of Rupture to give away (UK only).

Edmund knows she's hiding something, but needs to discover just why she's maintaining her silence. For how can it be that someone would willingly go to their own death?My verdictThe Unseeing is page-turning historical crime fiction. It's a gripping read and I was glued to the book from start to finish. I was particularly fascinated by the underlying true story and this is certainly one I'm interested to explore.The story focuses on Sarah Gale, who was sentenced to hang for murder, but Sarah refuses to say anything that could either help her case or hinder it. Edmund Fleetwood, the lawyer appointed to investigate, isn't sure whether Sarah's hiding something.Thanks to Anna Mazzola's gift for storytelling, I also wasn't sure whether or not Sarah could be trusted. The characters are so well developed that I actually cared what happened to them by the end of the book - and would still love to know the 'after'.

{"title": "From News to Novels - author guest post by TM Logan", "date": "Wednesday 25 January 2017", "text": "I am delighted to welcome author TM Logan to my blog today to talk about 'From News to Novels'. TM Logan's book Lies was published in e-book by Twenty7 on 17 January 2017.From News to NovelsBy TM LoganAuthors come from every kind of background. For me, it wasjournalism. I always knew I wanted to write, and that instinct led me to spendeight years as a newspaper reporter including a stint on a national daily inLondon. In many respects I think it’s a good preparation for a writer – hereare a few of the ways that journalism helped me in writing my debut novel LIES.1. Respect the readerA constant refrain during my training was that if the readerdidn’t understand what you’d written first time around, it wasn’t their fault,it was yours. In other words, the point is to communicate – to be clear –rather than try to show off. Whatever you’re writing, your words should be abridge to connect with the reader, rather than a barrier. As the writer AmyHempel put it: ‘Journalism taught me how to write a sentence that would makesomeone want to read the next one.’2. People are going to change what you writeThere’s (almost) always a better way to write what you’vealready written. When I was a reporter, it was absolutely routine foreveryone’s copy to go through one or more sub-editors on its way to the page.They would tighten it, sharpen it, improve it, and come back with questionsthat needed answers or elements that ought to be added. This gets you used tothe process of revising and copy-editing a novel – to make it the very best itcan be.3. Getting used to deadlinesThis is both a blessing and a curse. I spent so long workingto daily deadlines, filing three or four stories a day, that I became used tothe pressure and accustomed to writing against the clock. Which is helpful whenyou have to meet a short writing deadline. The flipside, however, is that whenthe deadline stretches out for months – such as writing a 100,000-word firstdraft – it can be difficult to retain your focus. My solution is to haveself-imposed wordcount targets, and to write every day to meet them.4. Writing as a way to make a livingIn some ways, writing is like a muscle – the more youexercise it, the more effective it becomes. Being a journalist, and in mycurrent role in communications, there is an expectation that you will bewriting every day, and this is not a bad preparation for the writer’s life.Every day you start with a blank page, and every day you fill it. Journalismshowed me that I could do something I love – writing – and make a living out ofit5. ‘Write it as if it’s true'I had quite a few weird moments as science reporter at the Daily Mail. One day I was assigned astory about strange lights in the sky that looked like alien spacecraft. Couldthey be visitors from another galaxy? I duly rang around various astronomerswho explained to me what caused this phenomenon (not aliens, unfortunately). Itold the assistant news editor the story was a dud. His response was a furrowedbrow, followed by: ‘Can you write it asif it’s true?’ But it’s not true,I said again. It was one of the weirdest instructions I ever received as ajournalist, but it has some merit for fiction writers. Because if you can writeyour story as if it’s true, as ifit’s really happening to someone, somewhere, then it will feel all the morereal to the reader – and that’s something I’ve tried to do with LIES.About TM LoganT M Loganis former Daily Mail science reporter, covering stories on newdevelopments in a wide variety of scientific fields. He isDeputy Director of Communications at the University of Nottingham and lives inNottinghamshire with his wife and two children.Find TM Logan on Twitter - @TMLoganAuthorAbout LiesLiesBy TM LoganPublished by Twenty7 (E-book out now; Paperback in May 2017)ISBN: 978-1785770555Publisher's descriptionWhen JoeLynch stumbles across his wife driving into a hotel car park while she'ssupposed to be at work, he's intrigued enough to follow her in.And when hewitnesses her in an angry altercation with family friend Ben, he knows he oughtto intervene.But just asthe confrontation between the two men turns violent, and Ben is knockedunconscious, Joe's young son has an asthma attack - and Joe must flee in orderto help him.When hereturns, desperate to make sure Ben is OK, Joe is horrified to find that Benhas disappeared.And that'swhen Joe receives the first message . . .You can buy Lies here."},

Gail's book Loving the Life Less Lived is published in e-book by RedDoor Publishing on 26 January 2017. Mental health & writingBy Gail Marie MitchellI never intended towrite about my mental health… I’ve always written fiction and poetry. I’vetried my hand at novels without much success. The idea (and the name) for Loving the Life Less Lived came in anepiphany moment one evening when I was lying in bed feeling depressed andanxious after having left yet another job due to my anxiety and panic attacks.I describe this in more detail in the prologue but, in short, I saw an oldschool friend tweet a video where she was talking to a global summit in NewYork about everyone’s unique skill set. I felt completely inadequate. All I wasgood at, I reasoned, was getting anxious and running away. Something in mysubconscious added ‘writing’ to my list of skills and the idea to write aboutexperiences was born.I hope my readerswill …. feel that they are listening to a friend when they read Loving the Life Less Lived. I’m not anexpert and I don’t like telling people what they should do but I have been onthis road for many years and I hope that by sharing what has happened to me, itwill help people not to feel so isolated and alone. It will also give them abrief insight into the tools that have taken me all my adult life to gather. Isee it as starting a conversation about mental health rather than providing allthe answers. I completely changedthe ending after it was written…having completed the book with a huge sighof relief a significant event happened in my life (I don’t want to spoil theend by revealing it) so a few months later I went back and re-wrote the finalchapter. I think this gives a more real and definitely more heartfelt ending. I want to give themessage that….It's ok not to be ok. In fact quite often it’s great not to beok. I spent many years swinging on a pendulum between cripplinganxiety/depression on the one hand and telling myself that I was completelycured on the other. Each new ‘breakdown’ (for want of a better word) hit meharder than the one before and I punished myself mentally for being so weak andstupid. Nowadays I just accept that my anxiety is part of me and that sometimesI do get depressed. I still have episodes of mental ill health but, byaccepting them as part of who I am, I don’t dip so low and recover much quicker.My aim is for my readers to feel encouraged and empoweredabout who they are and to use the tools available to them to be the best thatthey can be. At the same time I really want people to be kind to themselveswhen they are experiencing bouts of anxiety or depression. I want other peopleto be kind to them too which brings me on to the fact that…People are startingto talk about mental health, but there are many who just won’t listen… ifonly I could get those people to read my book! It’s great that more and more people are being open about theirmental health issues but that’s only half of the battle. 1 in 4 people in theUK at any one time is being treated for mental ill-health but time and timeagain I still come up against people who don’t see it as a real or genuineillness, especially in the work place. For all my stories of facing stigmathere are a million more experiences out there. When I’m well I can advocatefor myself quite vociferously, but when I’m ill I just run away. People who experienceanxiety and depression are not weak…it takes tremendous strength sometimes even to get out of bed. Opening a letteror answering the phone may seem like simple tasks but to some people itinvolves climbing an emotional Everest every single day. As James Joyce oncesaid ‘“Your battles inspired me - not theobvious material battles but those that were fought and won behind yourforehead.” I love who I am andwhere I am and it’s all thanks to my mental health… it’s been a rocky roadthat has led me to what I call the LifeLess Lived but I am immeasurably grateful for it. Apart from the fact thatI am stronger and have more empathy I have also met amazing people who Iwouldn’t have given the time of day before I was ill. I now have a life that Ilove and I am so glad that I made it through the ‘I can’t take any more’ daysto getAbout Gail Marie Mitchell Gail Marie Mitchell has tried her hand at many things over theyears from studying chemistry at the University of York to teaching in thefavelas of Brazil.

Evil Games is published by Zaffre in paperback today on 26th January 2017. The Role of Supporting Characters By Angela Marsons I am often asked how I form and create the supporting characters for the Kim Stone series of crime novels which has caused me to give it some serious thought.  I tend to divide supporting characters into two categories – recurring or plot only.Plot OnlyMost characters only appear in one book and are central to the plot and what they offer or bring to the movement of the the story.  For these characters I concentrate primarily on their motivations in connection with pushing the plot forward.  There is always a little colour added to help the reader visualise the person that exists in my mind although I do like there to be a bit of ‘reader licence’ with these characters as we all imagine things just a little differently.RecurringWith the recurring characters I think more about what they can bring to the main character of Kim Stone – what aspect of her personality do they touch or allow me to explore in her interactions with them.Bryant is the long suffering working partner of Kim and is the closest thing to a friend that she has.  Bryant can push Kim further than anyone else and is the only one with enough courage to tell her the truth.  One of Bryant’s roles is to bring out the humour in Kim.  Their banter is often a light relief to the darkness of the subject matter for both the reader and for me while I’m writing it.Dawson is the young, cocky detective who knows it all and constantly pushes the boundaries.  He questions Kim’s decisions constantly but is very loyal and hard-working and although he makes mistakes his motivation and passion is evident.Stacey is the studious member of the team.  Her skills lie in data mining.  As the youngest member of the team she brings out the nurturing element of Kim’s personality and in some ways her protective instinct.  There are times when Kim holds Stacey back from doing her job as she is fearful for her safety.Woody is Kim’s boss and unusually a great deal of respect exists between them.  They don’t always agree and Kim often challenges his decisions and instructions.  He allows Kim to explore the rebellious side of her personality.  Despite her difficult manner he appreciates her passion and energy and ability to do the job.Keats is the Pathologist who baits Kim at every opportunity.  His role is to demonstrate Kim’s patience and tolerance.  There are times when she bites back but for the most part she allows him to have some fun at her expense.  She respects his manner, attitude and ethics when dealing with the dead.Daniel Bate is a scientist for whom Kim feels a physical attraction.

The One is being published in e-book by Ebury on 26 January 2017 and in paperback in May 2017. Read my review...The OneBy John MarrsPublished by Ebury (E-book - 26 January 2017; Paperback - May 2017)ISBN: 978-1785035623Publisher's descriptionHow farwould you go to find THE ONE?One simplemouth swab is all it takes. One tinyDNA test to find your perfect partner - the one you're genetically made for. A decadeafter scientists discover everyone has a gene they share with just one person,millions have taken the test, desperate to find true love. Now, fivemore people take the test. But even soul mates have secrets. And some are moreshocking - and deadlier - than others...My verdictI was hooked on The One immediately. It's a very easy read with a compelling story, and one of the most cleverly plotted books I have read in a while. I enjoyed both of John Marrs' previous books, so I shouldn't really be surprised!The One features five different threads, each one following a different person's experience of the DNA test that 'finds your perfect match'. One would have been great, but five is a real treat, as all possible scenarios seem to be covered (I won't give any of these away).This psychological thriller is certainly written to make the reader think - a 'what if' book. Would you be willing to take the test to find your perfect match? What if you're already in a happy relationship? What if your perfect match seemed so unrealistic?The chapters are short and snappy, with a cliffhanger at the end, which kept me reading on and on... and on. I struggled to put this book down! There are twists and turns, some small, some large. Some I guessed, others I didn't.I thought this book was brilliant and will recommending it widely!I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog Tour"},

To him the world isa frightening mystery. But as his imagination comes to life, his family will bechanged . . . for good.My verdictA Boy Made of Blocks is a book about communication and relationships - between husbands and wives, fathers and sons and family and friends. It's based on the author's experiences with his own autistic son, which makes the book so believable and realistic. It's a very honest account and, at times, it read like memoir rather than fiction.Alex is struggling to cope with Sam's autism. He finds it difficult to understand how his son sees the world - and also how the world views his son. When Sam develops an interest in the online building game Minecraft, this opens up a whole new world for Alex and Sam - and provides a virtual place where they can learn to communicate and connect with one another.A Boy Made of Blocks is heartwarming, emotional and entertaining - a story to make you laugh and cry. It's an easy read and well written, with a fast pace and great characterisation. I enjoyed seeing how the relationship between Alex and Sam strengthened throughout the book. You don't need to know anything about Minecraft to read this as the game itself is well described (although I have played it with my boys before so knew exactly what is involved).I received an Advance Reader Copy.Find today's other Blog Tour stops"},

They have what he needs.What beginsis a terrifying cat-and-mouse game between the sinister collector, Jakey'sfather and Etta Fitzroy, a troubled detective investigating a spate ofabductions.My verdictI loved Rattle and can't praise it highly enough - the writing is brilliant, the plot is brilliant... in fact, everything about it is brilliant. There aren't many serial killer books around at present, so it's certainly very different to other crime novels too.The plot is chilling - children are going missing and it seems that there is a serial killer on the loose. He's evil, creepy and certainly someone to avoid - but that's not easy when you have something he wants and he'll do anything to get it.Fiona Cummins writes atmospheric chilling prose - vivid descriptions of people and places that made my skin tingle - and has created a gripping plot filled with action, intrigue and believable characters. I held my breath for many of the final chapters. The book has clearly been well researched and I found the medical background fascinating (possibly because of my own interests in health and medicine). This is a crime thriller with unbelievable depth.Rattle is stunning. I couldn't put it down - yet didn't want it to end.

He’s out of his depth and out of time.How can hesave the girl, when he can't even save himself?My verdictSirens is a powerful crime novel filled with emotion and darkness.Although set in Manchester, Sirens has a classic US feel to it (echoes of Raymond Chandler), with taut rhythmic narrative, powerful dialogue, realistic characters and a multi-layered plot. It's intense, violent, tragic and stunningly written, pulling the punches with every sentence and tricking the reader right until the shocking end.Detective Aiden Waits is far more than your usual disgraced detective, haunted by his past and unsure of his future. While keeping an eye on an MP's wayward daughter, he gets caught up with Manchester's drug lords and ends up out of his depth as the body count rises. He's as damaged as you can get, addicted to drink and drugs while he works undercover. Yet he's still extremely likeable and I couldn't help but feel for him, willing for him to climb out of his pit of despair.Joseph Knox has a distinctive voice, and Sirens certainly doesn't read like a debut.

I hadn't read one of his books for a while, so jumped at the chance to read this. It didn't take long for me to realise what I've been missing.The Bone Field crosses genres - it's a combination of police procedural and action thriller.

{"title": "Deep Down Dead vs The Writing Group by Steph Broadribb - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Thursday 5 January 2017", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Steph Broadribb to my blog today talking about writing groups, as part of her blog tour. Steph's debut novel Deep Down Dead was published by Orenda Books in paperback today - 5th January 2017. Deep Down Dead vs The Writing Group(or how being part of a writing grouphelped me write Deep Down Dead)By Steph BroadribbSo what about writing groups, are they a good idea?Yes or No? Help or hindrance? Well, for me, being part of a writing group is a definiteyes, yes, yes, and here’s five reasons why:#1 - You Get Too CloseAfter a while I find it hard to be objective about my ownwriting. I need someone else’s opinion, and it needs to be someone I trust tobe constructive but also pull no punches about what needs to be better. I needthem to sock in to me straight. Because I want to get the story, and thecharacters, and the setting as good as I can before I give it to my editor. Thefabulous folks in my writing group do that. They’re objective, they tell metheir view and I listen. And then I go back to my laptop and I edit. #2 - You Have To Toughen UpDEEP DOWN DEAD has been workshopped through the group, bothon the MA in Creative Writing (Crime Novels) at City University London where weall met, and then later during the editing process for Orenda Books. Theirfeedback has helped me shape and refine the story and the characters. Andthat’s a big part of it, you have to be open to hearing the feedback andthinking about changing things – a writing group isn’t about hearing how goodthings are, it’s about looking for the stuff that’s not working and finding away to make it better. It can make you relook at how you’re doing a scene andhave a total rethink. I love that about it.Sometimes they make the perfect suggestion for an extrascene or edge to a character. Rod Reynolds actually wrote one of my favouritelines in Deep Down Dead – maybe if you can guess which one I’ll give you aprize! I’m now writing the second book in the Lori Anderson series – DEEP BLUETROUBLE – and yes, you’ve guessed it, the writing group have already read a bigchunk of it.#3 - Moral supportSometimes things don’t go well. The characters aren’tworking, the plot has more holes than a pair of laddered fishnets, and you’vejust no idea how you’re going to resolve all the storylines you’re set running.This is when writing groups really come into their own, because the people inthe group are writers as well. They understand. They know all about the thingsyou’re experiencing because they’ve experienced them too. It’s normal. But thatdoesn’t mean that when you’re up against it on a deadline and the words aren’tflowing you’re going to be at all rational about it. This is the moment when your writing group will give you advice,they’ll tell you that it’ll get better, they’ll talk you through the plot andsuggest ways to fill the holes. You’ll trust them, believe them, and start tofeel better. And they’ll pour you wine. A lot of wine (I’m looking at you LauraShephard-Robinson!).#4 - You Get Out MoreMy writing group meets roughly once a month. That means Ihave to get out of my PJs (oh the glamour of being a writer!), wash my hair,put on some make-up and venture into London. Basically, my writing group forcesme to leave the house and stops me becoming a total hermit locked in my ownfantasy world. I think that’s a good thing. I can get rather tunnel visionedotherwise!#5 - You’re In It TogetherIn the group I’m a member of we all write crime thrillersbut our sub-genres are slightly different. It means I get to read the drafts ofsuper talented folks early (and marvel at their awesomeness) – I get to readhistorical, noir, action thriller, spy thrillers, gangland crime and detectivefiction plus crime with a supernatural twist – and I love the variety.We’ve been on the journey together. We got to know eachother when we were doing the MA Creative Fiction (Crime Novels) at CityUniversity London and established a weekly practice of workshopping our writingand have carried on meeting regularly ever since. It means you can share thehighs and the lows. Swop advice – a shout out to the wonderful Rod Reynolds [The Dark Inside, Black Night Falling] andDavid Young [Stasi Child, Stasi Wolf]here who as the first published members of the group have been so generous intheir advice on what to expect after you sign the publishing contract. The journey to publication has been all the more fun forhaving shared it with them.About Steph BroadribbSteph Broadribbis an alumni of the MA Creative Writing at City University London and trainedas a bounty hunter in California.

When they’re ambushed at a gas station, the stakes go from high to stratospheric, and things become personal.My verdictI read most of Deep Down Dead in one day, in one sitting, in just a few hours. It's a BRILLIANT action thriller! Sexy, gripping, fast-paced, fresh... and definitely a page turner that will keep you reading late into the night or all day long (trust me - I know from experience!).Steph Broadribb (aka crimethrillergirl) has created a fantastic rollercoaster read. Think Stephanie Plum (Janet Evanovitch) & Jack Reacher (Lee Child) rolled into one.Deep Down Dead has an authentic American feel with a fantastic plot, vivid setting and amazing writing that puts you right into the heart of the action - a clear winning formula. Yes, violence is an integral part of the plot, but this book doesn't feel violent as it's so well written - it's like watching an expertly choreographed action sequence in a film that's vital & engaging... which means I also have to mention that this book would make a perfect transition to the big screen.Steph Broadribb's lead character Lori Anderson is an all-action girl, but also has a feminine side. I love the inclusion of Lori's nine-year-old daughter Dakota (who has leukaemia) - this gives Lori a focus other than her bounty hunting, a sense of responsibility and a past that softens her, so she's believable and someone you want to get to know. It also means you're in for an emotional journey too - this is a book that will make you cry, laugh, scream, wince and hold your breath. And as for JT... WOW, we want more of him!Deep Down Dead heralds the start of a new series. It's contains everything you want in an action thriller - a strong female lead, sexy potential partner, thrilling plot and a lot of heart. This book is going to fly its way up the charts! Bring on the next Lori Anderson book!!!!I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

Donald is a young fisherman, eking outa lonely living on the west coast of Scotland. One night he witnesses somethingmiraculous ...and makes a terrible mistake. His action changes lives - not onlyhis own, but those of his family and the entire tightly knit community in whichthey live. Can he ever atone for the wrong he has done, and can love grow whenits foundation is violence? Based on the legend of the selkies - seals who cantransform into people - Sealskin is a magical story, evoking the harsh beautyof the landscape, the resilience of its people, both human and animal, and thetriumph of hope over fear and prejudice.My verdictSelkies are mythological creatures in Scottish folklore - seals who can shed their skin to become human on land. In Sealskin, Su Bristow has brought the magic of this wonderful legend to life.When Donald, a young fisherman, sees selkies for the first time, he is overcome with emotion. He has no idea that his unexpected and shocking response will have life-changing repercussions, not just for him and his family but for his whole community.Sealskin is exquisitely written with haunting prose and evocative descriptions of the Scottish landscape. It's filled with beauty, surprises and subtle twists and turns. There's a mesmerising love story at its heart. But this book is far more than just a love story. It's about forgiveness, taking responsibility for our actions, planning for the future, standing up for what's right, overcoming our fears and being accepted by a tight-knit community that's not used to strangers. I could go on, but I'll let readers discover the many layers for themselves.I don't think there was a single character who didn't change somehow by the end of Sealskin. A whole community was bewitched by the magic. Just as I was.I tried to read Sealskin slowly, as I wanted the book to last, yet it was so compelling that I struggled to put it down. I really didn't want the story to end - and felt bereft when it did, surrounded by boxes of tissues. I'm sure I'll be reading this book several times to feel that magic again and again.It's no surprise that Su Bristow is an Exeter Novel prize-winner. Her writing is beautiful and this book is stunning. Sealskin is destined to go far.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher."},

{"title": "Six Stories by Matt Wesolowski", "date": "Tuesday 20 December 2016", "text": "Six StoriesBy Matt WesolowskiPublished by Orenda Books (E-book - 20 December 2016; Paperback - 15 March 2017)ISBN: 9781910633625 Publisher's description1997.Scarclaw Fell. The body of teenager Tom Jeffries is found at an outward boundcentre. Verdict? Misadventure. But not everyone is convinced. And the truth ofwhat happened in the beautiful but eerie fell is locked in the memories of thetight-knit group of friends who took that fateful trip, and the flimsytestimony of those living nearby. 2017. Enter elusive investigative journalistScott King, whose podcast examinations of complicated cases have rivalled thesuccess of Serial, with his concealed identity making him a cult internetfigure.My verdictAs soon as I read the blurb for Six Stories, I was intrigued. But I have to admit that I began reading the book with some trepidation as I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations.My verdict? WOW! Not only did it live up to my expectations but it surpassed them.Six Stories is unlike anything else I've read. It's current, fresh and skillfully delivered. There's a classic murder mystery to solve - the death of a teenager in 1996 and the discovery of his body a year later. Twenty years on, a leading investigative journalist is looking at the evidence and interviewing those who were present at the time. The way in which he is conducting his investigation (through a series of podcasts) is as modern as you could possibly get in the digital age.When I read a book, I have to read whole chapters at a time. I can't stop a reading session in the middle of the chapter - call it a foible of mine! With Six Stories, I found myself reading a whole podcast at a time (including the previous chapter - you'll have to see why), so that I could digest the information and then think about what I had just read. Some of the podcasts are fairly long - not surprising as there are only six in the book. I also had to find time to concentrate without a risk of interruption, so read most of the book late in the evenings.Six Stories is an eerie spine-tingling read. It's unpredictable and chilling and kept me guessing all the way through. I don't scare easily, but certainly found this book unsettling. Matt Wesolowski has built up a dark, atmospheric setting with his vivid descriptive prose. The voices were so distinctive that I felt like I was listening to a podcast rather than simply reading the transcript. I built up a picture of the people, relationships between characters and an amazing sense of place. It felt more like fact than fiction - and I had to keep reminding myself that Scarclaw Fell isn't real!I'm not familiar with Serial, which is what Six Stories is being compared with, although I will now be checking it out. But I do feel this book will appeal to fans of the documentary Making a Murderer. In some ways, its horror element reminded me of the Blair Witch Project - it's what you can't see that's most frightening. Scarclaw Fell will remain with me - and I'll be thinking about what happened to Tom Jeffries - for some time.Everyone will want to read this book - and should!I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

{"title": "Saving Sophie by Sam Carrington ", "date": "Thursday 15 December 2016", "text": "I'm delighted to be today's stop on the Saving Sophie blog tour today. Saving Sophie by Sam Carrington was published in paperback by Avon on 15 December 2016.Saving SophieBy Sam CarringtonPublished by Avon (E-book - out now; Paperback - 15 December 2016)ISBN: 978-0008191818Publisher's descriptionA teenagegirl is missing. Is your daughter involved, or is she next?Yourdaughter is in danger. But can you trust her?When KarenFinch’s seventeen-year-old daughter Sophie arrives home after a night out,drunk and accompanied by police officers, no one is smiling the morning after.But Sophie remembers nothing about how she got into such a state.Twelvehours later, Sophie’s friend Amy has still not returned home. Then the body ofa young woman is found.Karen issure that Sophie knows more than she is letting on. But Karen has her owndemons to fight. She struggles to go beyond her own door without a panicattack.As shebecomes convinced that Sophie is not only involved but also in danger, Karenmust confront her own anxieties to stop whoever killed one young girl moving onto another – Sophie.My verdictSaving Sophie is an easy read with dramatic scenes and a gripping plot.Karen Finch wonders if something sinister happened on her daughter Sophie's night out, after the police brought Sophie home, drunk and confused. When Sophie's friend Amy doesn't return home, Karen becomes convinced that Sophie is also in danger, especially as her daughter's friends seem very vague about that night. But to unravel the lies, Karen needs to overcome her crippling agoraphobia. How far is she prepared to go to save her daughter?The book is cleverly constructed, with twists and turns that keep on coming. It explores various relationships - between parents and children, teenagers and their peers and husbands and wives - and is essentially a book about fear. How our fears play on our mind, leading us to question everything, and control how we act and behave towards ourselves and others. And whether we can overcome our fears to save the ones we love.I can't say I particularly liked any of the characters, including Karen herself, and I did wonder why the police weren't more involved. But the short intense chapters led me to read 'just a bit more' and before I knew it, I was halfway through the book - and then at the end. For me, this was a one-sitting compelling read. And I look forward to reading Sam Carrington's next book!I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Blog TourLone WolfBy Sara Driscoll (Jen J. Danna & Ann Vanderlaan)Published by Kensington (29 November 2016)ISBN: 978-1496704412Publisher's descriptionIn the firstbook in a thrilling new series, FBI Special Agent Meg Jennings and Hawk, herloyal search-and-rescue Labrador, must race against time as they zero in on oneof the deadliest killers in the country . . .Meg andHawk are part of the FBI s elite K-9 unit. Hawk can sniff out bodies anywhereliving or dead whether it s tracking a criminal or finding a missing person.When a bomb rips apart a government building on the National Mall in WashingtonD.C., it takes all of the team's extensive search-and-rescue training to locateand save the workers and visitors buried beneath the rubble. But even asthe duo are hailed as heroes, a mad bomber remains at large, striking terroracross the Eastern seaboard in a ruthless pursuit of retribution. As more bombsare detonated and the body count escalates, Meg and Hawk are brought in to atask force dedicated to stopping the unseen killer. But when the attacks spiralwide and any number of locations could be the next target, it will come down toa battle of wits and survival skills between Meg, Hawk, and the bomber they retracking to rescue a nation from the brink of chaos.My verdictSara Driscoll is the pen name of Jen J. Danna & Ann Vanderlaan. I love their Abbot and Lowell Forensic Mysteries, so was very excited to discover they were starting off a new series of action thrillers, with a focus on K-9 rescue teams.Not only are their crime fiction novels great reads, but I always felt like I had learnt something by the end. Lone Wolf is no exception. Each chapter begins with a snippet of relevant terminology, providing some background information on the training and working life of the FBI's K-9 search and rescue unit.Lone Wolf focuses on one particular team who do search and rescue but also get involved in criminal investigations. The action thriller aspect kept me gripped and I found it very difficult to put the book down. The excellent writing is intense, engaging and fast paced, with vivid and highly emotive descriptions of the bombing sites, which immersed me totally into the plot.Meg is a strong female lead and very believable. I expect some romance will develop between her and a certain firefighter in future books. But what really made this book stand out for me was the rapport between the FBI agents and their canine team mates. There was a genuine mutual affection and appreciation. They not only worked together to rescue others, but also worked together to keep each other safe. I have since read some of Jen J. Danna's blog posts to learn more about the K-9 unit and discovered that this really is the case. Lone Wolf is very realistic and well researched.I really enjoyed Lone Wolf and look forward to seeing how this series develops and progresses.I received an Advance Reader Copy."},
{"title": "What Alice Knew by T.A. Cotterell ", "date": "Wednesday 14 December 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the What Alice Knew blog tour. What Alice Knew by T.A. Cotterell was published in e-book by Black Swan on 1 December 2016.What Alice KnewBy T.A. CotterellPublished by Black Swan (E-book - 1 December 2016; Paperback - 20 April 2017)ISBN: 978-1784162399Publisher's descriptionAlice has aperfect life – a great job, happy kids, a wonderful husband. Until he goesmissing one night; she receives a suspicious phone call; things don’t quite addup. Alice needsto know what’s going on. But when she uncovers the truth she faces a brutalchoice. And how can she be sure it is the truth?Sometimesit’s better not to know.My verdictWhat Alice Knew isn't an easy book to review without giving away any spoilers. There is a crime involved - but you know who the culprit is from very early on and the story focuses on the aftermath instead. It's very much a character-led novel.This psychological thriller presents Alice (the protagonist) and the reader with a moral dilemma. How far would you go to protect your family? And what would you do if you knew a secret that could tear your family apart? It's written in a stunning literary style, with vivid descriptions and tense narrative. It certainly makes the reader think carefully about each character and whether they can be trusted. The author has done a great job of blurring the lines between right and wrong and showing that not all moral dilemmas are as black and white as they initially seem.I have to admit that I didn't particularly like Alice, or some of her views, so I found it difficult to empathise with her dilemma. But some of the best books are filled with characters you're meant to hate. There's a strong emphasis on history of art (as Alice is a portrait painter) and the author clearly knows his stuff, writing with a passion. I did find this slowed down the plot at times, yet I remained intrigued right until the end.And as for that ending... it wasn't what I expected at all. It's quite ambiguous, and I'm sure it will prompt many reading group discussions. In fact, the whole book was not what I was expecting when I sat down to read. I thought it would be a standard psychological thriller about a woman who is trying to save her marriage. Yet What Alice Knew is much darker and more twisted than that - and is certainly a book that makes you think.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher.Follow the Blog Tour"},

FountainPublished by Sphere (E-book - out now; Paperback - 29 December 2016)ISBN: 978-0751561210Publisher's descriptionI cannot goon like this. I feel such a burden to you. You are young and can start again.You deserve that chance. By the time you read this I will be dead. Do notgrieve for me, for I am now without pain.Yours trulyfor ever,MonicaMonicasuffers from chronic neuropathic pain. Every second of her life is spent inagony, and she is coping with it the best she can. However, there are wholeyears of her life which are a blur to her.But whenshe finds a suicide note, written in her handwriting, she begins to questioneverything. She has no memory of writing it - so who did? And if someone triedto kill her once, what's to say they won't try again . . .My verdictThe main protagonist in Painkiller has chronic neuropathic pain - and this is what attracted me to the book in the first place. Monica takes strong medication that can cause memory loss in high doses. When she finds her own suicide note but doesn't remember writing it, she wonders if someone tried to kill her and whether they could try again.I found myself reviewing this book from three angles. Firstly, as a reader/reviewer. Secondly, as a health journalist. And thirdly, as someone who suffers from a chronic pain condition.As a reader/reviewer, I thought Painkiller was well written and compelling. I read most of the book in one sitting. It started out much more seriously than it ended, with plenty of dark humour, and did become less believable as it approached the final few chapters. Because of Monica's memory loss, she didn't know who she should trust. This enticed me to keep reading - because I was clueless too. The ending was a complete surprise but felt a little rushed - a lot happened in a short space of time, with several twists and turns. It certainly made for some fast-paced reading, but I did find it confusing in places.As a health journalist, I thought the book was well researched. More about the chronic pain element below, but the author has clearly looked into the background and treatments. My only quibble is that I don't want others with chronic pain to be put off taking prescribed medication, as the underlying message within the book is fairly hard hitting - that taking strong medication for chronic pain can leave you bed bound and drifting in and out of sleep with little memory or concentration. I wouldn't want anyone reading this book to avoid going to the GP for help, as there are many treatment options available. At certain doses (and this will differ for each person), prescribed medication for chronic pain can be very effective and with fewer side effects than the protagonist experiences.As a chronic pain sufferer, I thought the protagonist's thoughts and feelings were very realistic. At the beginning of each chapter, Monica wakes up and assesses how she feels that day. The book portrayed very well what it's like to live with an invisible illness - you look fine on the outside, but inside you may feel like you're falling apart. It's great that Painkiller highlights these issues to the wider world.I'm sure Painkiller will appeal to many psychological thriller fans - especially those who loved Girl On The Train and Gone Girl. It could also make it a 'marmite' book - one that people will love or hate - and definitely a book to talk about afterwards. It's certainly a book that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a psychological thriller that's 'different' from the current trend.I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

It's fast paced and tense, with plenty of twists, turns and surprise, and I read most of it in one sitting.This is a serial killer story, but with a quirkiness that makes it stand out from the crowd. Each death scene is beautifully crafted - the gruesome murders are deliberately put on public display by a killer who is desperate for an audience.

Why are theclose-knit group of mums who surrounded Sarah so reluctant to share what theyknew about their beautiful, troubled friend? And how high a price will Mia payfor her determination to unearth the truth and discover what reallyhappened? My verdict I enjoyed A Daughter's Secret by the same author, so welcomed the opportunity to read Too Close for Comfort, which features some of the same characters.Again, this book is a slow burner. It's more a psychological study of relationships between friends, with plenty of drama and intrigue, than a psychological thriller. There wasn't that much of a 'thriller' element, less than in the author's first book, although this didn't impact on my enjoyment at all.The writing is beautiful, providing vivid descriptions of people and places. The characters are well drawn with realistic flaws. I found myself gradually immersed into the lives of these women and the close-knit community in which they live. I was intrigued to discover what secrets they were hiding - and why. There was so much raw emotion bubbling under the surface - and on the surface - from pain and grief to lies and bitterness. I admit I wasn't sure about the big reveal at the end - how realistic it was. But overall, this was a very enjoyable read and one that I would recommend.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher."},

Daniel's Amsterdam detective series, The Harbour Master, was published by No Exit Press on 10 November 2016.  He will be one of the authors at the First Monday Crime Christmas Special on December 5th.A year ago, you wrote a piece for my blog about your shortstory The Lion Hunter. The Harbour Master was originallypublished as three separate novellas, but has now been republished as a novelby No Exit Press. What do you enjoy most about writing shorter pieces offiction?I’ve read many great writers first via their novellas. A Christmas Carol by Dickens for example,or Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Take Jekyll and Hyde, or Old Man and the Sea. Writing in the New Yorker recently, Ian McEwandescribed the novella as the prefect form of prose fiction. For me as anauthor, I’m mostly drawn to the need for economy … but perhaps I just have aterrible attention span!You’re featuring at December’s First Monday Crime Christmas Special. Were you nervous the first time you appeared on a panel? And how did you get yourself through it? Any tips for debut panel members?It’s always a bit tense doing these things in front of an audience whose views I care about. I try to be relaxed and natural, but it’s good to prepare a little as well!Your book The Harbour Master is set mainly in Amsterdam. You spend a lot of time in Amsterdam, as well as London.What was it about Amsterdam that prompted you to set your books there?A close sister living there. An inability to find a lot of crimefiction set in Holland, in English translation at least, when I arrived (whichbaffled me given the output of neighbouring Scandinavia!). I was struck too byhow atmospheric those port cities are – Amsterdam, Rotterdam … wonderful! Theylend themselves so well to the genre, not least because of the good slice ofcriminality that goes with such historic trading hubs.If you could launch your next book anywhere in the world, inany location, building etc, where would you choose and why?Well it’s tempting to say somewhere overseas, probablyAmsterdam, but in reality I’d want everyone to be there. So short of having anunlimited budget for flying people around, I’d have to say London and plump forthe Dutch Embassy.The Harbour Mastercovers dark subjects – murder, drugs, smuggling, kidnapping...  Is there any topic you wouldn’t feel comfortablewriting about?I address the subject of child abuse in the next book, Night Market, which was tricky but requiredfor the story. I used the voice of the detective’s wife, Petra, to almost arguehis actions out in my head (how he should approach and think about investigatingsuch abuse). I couldn’t write anything graphic in that realm – nor in the realmof violence against women. If you were writing a book about your own life, what wouldthe title be? Something like TheConstant Traveller. I’ve now lived in seven countries including England andScotland (I went to university in Edinburgh). The other countries are France(where I also studied), the States and Luxembourg (where I worked), then Germanyand of course Holland. I travelled around Australia, too. The Constant Traveller, I tell you!Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Identifying the peculiarities of fascinating locations thatshape characters’ journeys.Why should people read The Harbour Master (your chance for a quick plug)?It’s Amsterdam, it’s the archetypal maverick detective, and it’s a personal journey from the streets of the Red Light District to the grandest corridors of power in the Netherlands. It’s also a story told in six parts – a bit like Stephen King’s The Green Mile. The first three parts are in the The Harbour Master, and the final three are in Night Market – due out in e-book format in January. So if you’re inviting me to plug, I have to recommend reading both books, sorry!About Daniel PembreyDaniel grew up in Nottinghamshire beside Sherwood Forest.

{"title": "Zero by Matt Brolly - Book Extract - Blog Tour", "date": "Tuesday 29 November 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for Zero by Matt Brolly. Zero was published as an e-book by Canelo on 21 November 2016.Read the extract from Chapter 2Inspector Kate Swanson knew the junior officer standing bythe courtroom doors watching her. Flaherty was flushed with excitement, sodesperate to get Swanson’s attention that for one horrendous second she thoughthe might shout over to her. Swanson turned her attention back towards JudgeLivermore. The accused, William Crampton, sat to Swanson’s right, on a separatetable with his lawyer. Little more than a child, he had been arrested sixmonths ago for petty theft after stealing a bottle of vodka from an off-licence,a dare from his fellow gang members. Dressed in a maroon jumpsuit, his narroweyes stared straight ahead. Swanson listened to the familiar sound of theverdict followed by the equally familiar sentence. There was only ever onesentence.Any breach of the criminal law, however minor, was subjectto an effective death sentence. After spending time in the holding zone,convicts were placed in the glass pods which journeyed throughout the city. Thejourney took thirty days, but after eight days the water supply was removed. Noone had ever survived the pods. Luis Ciucci had been the first prisoner to bepodded, not long after Swanson was born. Ciucci had murdered his wife’s loverin a crime of passion. His podding had been symbolic. People had sympathy forCiucci, and the council knew it. It would have been easier to pod someoneeveryone loathed, a multiple murderer, a rapist or child molester, but this waythey signaled to society that whatever your crime, whatever the mitigatingcircumstances, you were going to the pods.The boy barely reacted. Swanson had seen the weary look ofresignation countless times before. No doubt the hope had been ground out ofhim during his probationary incarceration. Even after all these years in theforce, all the prosecutions she’d been involved with, the verdict was stilldifficult to hear.‘Court dismissed,’ said the judge.Flaherty was by her side in seconds. In his grey-blueuniform, he looked like a schoolboy playing dressing-up games. He smelt ofnicotine and sweet aftershave. He pulled at the grey clip-on tie dangling fromhis throat. ‘Ma’am,’ he said.‘What is it?’ asked Swanson.‘It’s Judge Lloyd, Ma’am. He’s missing.’ Flaherty’s voicewas an octave higher than normal.‘Would you care to elaborate, Flaherty?’ suggested Swanson.‘He didn’t turn up for court today and there’s no sign ofhim at his house. His car is still parked in his garage.’ Flaherty was smiling.‘And?’‘Chessington wants you over there. As soon as you finishhere.’Swanson glared at him.‘Ma’am,’ he said.Swanson packed her files away. Five foot eleven with longblonde hair tied back into a ponytail, she was wearing her standard formalissue: a black pleated skirt, white blouse, and black jacket. On her left lapelshone three silver crowns. Her voice was deep and guttural, the legacy of achildhood throat infection which had permanently damaged her vocal cords.The public defender, Dave Legg, walked over and shook herhand, holding on longer than was necessary. ‘Another victory, Inspector Swanson,’he said. ‘It must make you proud, putting away such hardened criminals.’Swanson understood the man’s sarcasm, his despair at losinganother client, but couldn’t show any weakness. ‘Defeat makes you so bitter,Dave.’‘It is not the defeat, Inspector. It is the consequences ofdefeat which trouble me.’ He held her gaze, trying in vain to look nonchalant,then walked away. He had left a gold plated pen on his desk which Swansonplaced into her pocket.Outside, she barged through a group of journalists eachbarking questions at her. She made eye contact with one of their number, JaneSutton who she occasionally shared information with. She nodded to the womanbefore entering her car.As Swanson drove through the city to Judge Lloyd’s house,she tried not to think about the sentence just handed down to the young pettythief. The policy of Zero Tolerance, ZT, was fixed legislation. Its powerscould not be withdrawn, only extended. At present, any breach of criminal law,subject to a fair trial before judge and jury, was subject to the deathpenalty. Swanson had been working in the police force for the last eight yearsand had never known a society without the pods.She reminded herself that she didn’t make the policy. Herjob was to uphold the law, however draconian that law appeared to be. In herjudgement, the petty thief, Crampton, didn’t deserve to die. She empathisedwith the young man, and even with his obnoxious lawyer. Maybe one day therewould come a time when the law was not so severe, but until then, she had a jobto do.About the bookZeroBy Matt BrollyPublished by Canelo (E-book - 21 November 2016)Publisher's descriptionA zerotolerance policy results in the death penalty for all crimes, no matter howminor.When ajudge is kidnapped, and a ransom note demands the release of all prisonersawaiting execution, kleptomaniac Detective Inspector Kate Swanson is puton the case.But soonher boss also disappears.

But with luck on his side, John Wallace manages to escape. This leads to a deadly cat and mouse chase around the UK and US, with John Wallace trying to find out why he's been targeted.Pendulum is filled with action and suspense and would make a perfect Hollywood movie! I had no idea what was coming next - and while some of the scenes are a little far fetched, they provided great entertainment. I just had to suspend belief and go with the flow. I loved the plot and final reveal, with various interwoven threads that tied up in the end but left plenty of intrigue for the sequel.With its twists and turns, compelling plot, violent scenes, short snappy chapters and brilliant writing, Pendulum left me exhausted! I can't wait for the next one.I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

Laura feels helpless.When Autumnfails to return home from school one day, Laura goes looking for her. She findsa crowd of older children taunting her little girl.In the heatof the moment, Laura makes a terrible choice. A choice that will have devastatingconsequences for her and her daughter...My verdictBone by Bone is a well-written psychological thriller about how far a mother will go to protect her child.On reading the prologue, I thought this was going to be another 'missing child' book, but instead the plot focuses on bullying tactics - by both children and adults. When Laura's daughter Autumn is bullied by an older boy at school, Laura is determined that the young thug doesn't get away with it. But one silly mistake in the heat of the moment comes back to haunt her, time and time again.This is a compelling read that kept me gripped right until the end. Told from the points of view of both Laura and Autumn, it focuses on how one small event can escalate matters out of control - and how easy it is to be let down by the people and services who are supposed to provide protection.The book highlights the emotional impact of bullying and how damaging it can be to all those involved. There was a growing sense of unease as the plot developed, leading to uncomfortable reading at times. It definitely made me think about 'what if it happened to me or my children' and that, to me, is the sign of a good book."},

A liar, liar, liar. And I'm starting to see where she gets it from.WhenRosalind's fifteen-year-old daughter, Stephanie, ran away with her teacher,this ordinary family became something it had never asked to be. Their livesheld up to scrutiny in the centre of a major police investigation, the Simmswere headline news while Stephanie was missing with a man who was riskingeverything.Now, sixyears on, Ros takes a call that will change their lives all over again. He'sgoing to be released from prison. Years too early. In eleven days' time.AsTemperley's release creeps ever closer, Ros is forced to confront the eventsthat led them here, back to a place she thought she'd left behind, to questionsshe didn't want to answer. Why did she do it? Where does the blame lie? Whathappens next?My verdictThe Daughter's Secret covers a very topical issue - that of a 15-year-old girl who runs away with her teacher. Rather than focus on the 'missing child' events, this story takes place six years afterwards - when the teacher is finally being released from prison.Through flashbacks to the past, you're taken through the rollercoaster of emotions that Ros experienced when her daughter Steph ran away. In the present day, you can see how these emotions are still present, impacting on the whole family unit. Steph hasn't really spoken about her experience for six years. Now that Steph is home and her teacher, Nate Temperley, will soon be free, Ros begins to distrust her daughter yet again.The chapters are written in the form of a countdown to Temperley's release, so the tension and unease builds up easily as the book progresses. Would Steph run away with Temperley again and turn her back on her family? Would he take revenge on those who had kept the two of them apart for all those years?For me, this was a definite page turner, with various twists and turns and an unexpected ending. I was completely caught up in Ros' emotions, especially as she thought of ways to take revenge on Temperley, and also in the family dynamics. The book is cleverly plotted, beautifully written and an easy - although thought-provoking - read. It is marketed as a psychological thriller, but I would also say it also fits in well with family dramas.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley."},

Mark's latest book The London Cage was published by Fledgling Press on 29 June 2016.How I WriteBy Mark LeggattMany thanks toVictoria for asking me to contribute to her blog. I chose a topic that endlesslyfascinates me; how I actually get from the ‘idea’ to the ‘book on theshelf’.  I say fascinates me, as in myday job as a Project Manager, I’m always looking for ways to make processesmore efficient. Not stripping things down to the bare bone, but finding thebest method, and one which is tailored to my personal foibles, to achieve thefinal objective; a book. I’ve written on thistopic before for my own blog, but that was over a year ago, and things havemoved on. At first, in the years spent leading up to my first publishing deal, Ifilled endless notebooks with illegible handwriting; a general repository foranything that came into my head. I write every day, and as it started waybefore laptops were something you didn’t need a wheel barrow to lug around, anddidn’t threaten to break your legs if you did sat them on your lap. Paper andpen was always seemed the natural way to write, and for one good reason; Ican’t type and think of stories at the same time. My brain can type, or it canwrite. But not at the same time. Which is why I’m writing this blog by hand,with a fountain pen made in 1925, on Rhodia paper, and which I’ll dictate intomy laptop. But more of that later…At first, I used adesk diary, and wrote anything and everything during my working day. Day jobnote as well as ideas. I think I now have around fifty A4 and twenty A5notebooks crammed with rubbish; sorry, I meant scintillating wisdom. So, whenit came to actually writing a story, the keyboard on my computer was not mynatural environment. Basically, I’m a terrible typist.The day I got out ofbed, on a sunny day in the south of France, where I was ‘resting’ between jobs,and told myself to ‘stop talking about writing a book and bloody well get onwith it’, I drove up to the next village and bought a ton of paper and pens.Did I need them? No, I had shedloads at home, but this was a special day. Anybloody excuse to buy stationery, frankly. I came home, cleared the dining roomtable, and set to work. I had no idea where I was going, but that was fine, I’dfind my way if I didn’t give up. At first, I used A3 (andstill do) to brain dump anything that came into my head, but as I went back tothe day job, and lots of travel, that was impractical, so I change to A5notebooks, that I can open on an airline seat table, and then transfer everythingto A3 at the weekend. This became a really good habit, because in the rewriting,so many more things came and ideas blossomed. These days I don’t travel somuch, but if I do, and where ever I go, I carry an A5 notebook, and a FieldNotes notebook in my back pocket. I swear to you, the fabulous idea you justhad will disappear out your head in seconds if you don’t write it downimmediately. At home, where most ofmy writing is done, I start in old notebooks, and still do the same brain dump.I let my mind wander, and just keep scribbling, the idea will come out, and thebest way to make it happen is to write, and keep writing. It’s cathartic,productive and bloody good fun. And this is animportant thing to me; I love the act of writing with a pen or pencil. It’s aphysical manifestation of my thoughts, and it endlessly entertains, me, in anunabashed childish way. I’m not that fussy about my pen and paper, really, butgiven a choice, I’d go for a good fountain pen and some good paper. The paperis important because it need to be able to take the ink without bleedingthrough on to the next page. I won’t bore you with my research on the topic, butRhoda make damn fine paper. Now, once all theideas are out of my head, and I’ve organised them into some sort of synopsis,I’ll dictate it in the laptop, using Apple voice recognition or Dragon.Anything to save typing. And when the onscreen editing is done, and I have afinished synopsis, it’s time to get out the pencils.Why pencils? Well,it’s down to speed. I write faster with pencils. I chose either A4 Cartridgepaper, or a Rhodia a5 notepad, and just go for it. I sharpen 12 pencils, linethem up, and I’m ready to go. Endless reams of paperlater, I dictate the whole lot on the laptop, and we have a draft book. That’sthe easy bit over. Then the editing starts. And that’s a topic for another day…About Mark LeggattMarkLeggatt is the author of Names Of The Dead, The London Cage, and The Silk Road,a series of international thrillers which weave fact and fiction acrossthe globe.was born in Lochee, Dundee and currently lives in Edinburgh.He is amember of the Crime Writers Association in the UK, The Society of Authors,Scottish PEN, and the International Thriller Writers in the USA.

It was a great holiday read, especially in a hot setting that reminded me of the book's location. I was expecting romantic historical fiction (not something I read very often) and was very pleasantly surprised to discover that Eden Gardens was so much more than this.Louise Brown's beautiful vivid writing transported me to 1940s Calcutta, where Maisy lived with her Mam and ayah Pushpa. Eden Gardens certainly provided me with an alternative view of the British in Calcutta, seeing beyond the wealth and romanticism of the era. Maisy and her mother live among the back streets - her mother has resorted to prostitution to ensure they have a home in India, rather than return to her roots in Leeds.

Steph is certainly put through her paces and given a rough time throughout the book. I did feel sorry for her and spent much of my time worrying about what was coming next.Lisa Hall has created an unsettling plot filled with paranoia. Who can be trusted? Can anyone be trusted?

{"title": "Researching disturbing storylines by Freya Barrington", "date": "Thursday 17 November 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Freya Barrington to my blog today talking about researching novels with factual yet disturbing storylines. Freya's latest book Caught in Traffick was published by Faraxa Publishing on 28 August 2016. Researching disturbing storylinesBy Freya BarringtonWhere does one begin when researching for books with a factual,yet disturbing story line? One which has to portray the realities of yoursubject material, while being mindful of the potential for causing distress toreaders. In my debut book, Known to Social Services, my aim wasto weave a story, which would raise the profile in regard to the complex andoften thankless task undertaken by social workers. As an ex child protectionsocial worker I drew heavily on personal experience; sifting through the hundredsof cases I had been involved with and choosing ones, which I felt depicted thecommon themes of social work.  Unsurprisingly,domestic violence, child abuse, neglect, drug and alcohol issues featuredthroughout. However, I also chose more controversial subjects, such as thereprehensible practice of female genital mutilation (Female circumcision),which is a growing issue in the UK. Striking the balance between providing anhonest yet non-gratuitous account of such an emotive, yet topical subject matterwas challenging. For my research, I read extensively, and was numb withhorror at the almost insufferable first-hand accounts of women who haveundergone this tortuous procedure. In Known to Social Services, a mothersmuggles her child out of the UK for the purpose of being circumcised. Iwondered if this was too far-fetched, but only a week after the book waspublished, a mother was arrested at Heathrow doing the very thing I had writtenabout in trying to take her daughter back to Somalia to be circumcised. A combination of personal experience and relevant reading,produced what I hoped was an honest and authentic glimpse of the realities offront line social work.My latest novel, Caught in Traffick is the sequel to Knownto Social Services, and was a more demanding book to write. The plotrevolves around a gang of child traffickers in Thailand who target and abductchildren for the sex trade. While I have experience and knowledge of childsexual abuse, writing about the specifics of child trafficking was a newchallenge.Conservative estimates put the figure of adults and childrencurrently enslaved by human trafficking at an astonishing 29 million; 27% ofthis number are children.  Humantrafficking has now surpassed the sale of illegal arms in terms of criminalactivity, and is a growing international problem, surpassed only by the drugtrade.  I hoped that a novel based aroundthis heinous trade would contribute to raising awareness of it.My choice of Thailand as a setting was deliberate.  Rated as one of the worst countries in theworld for human trafficking; it has gained notoriety as a place where one canlive, free of the most basic moral codes of decency. With high profile casesinvolving the victimisation and exploitation of children dating back manydecades, it is hardly surprising that Thailand has earned a reputation as asink hole of depravity.That said, child trafficking is a worldwide problem. Who inthe UK can be ignorant of the scandals which took place in Rotherham andRochdale? Gangs of predominantly Asian men targeting, grooming and sexuallyabusing young girls, and effectively trafficking them for the sex trade withintheir own communities. For research purposes, I read several books relatingdirectly to victims of the Rotherham and Rochdale cases; all were utterlydepressing and while offering an inside view of what had happened; all the books left me bewildered as to how these spectacularly high profilecases had managed to happen in a society, which is supposedly aware of suchissues.It was crucial to make Caught in Traffick as credible aspossible while weaving what I hoped would be an exciting and captivating story.The Internet became my best friend when researching in this regard. I found charities and other organisations which work towardsthe eradication of child trafficking especially informative and included a listat the back of the book as a reference.The National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Child Exploitationand Online Protection Centre (CEOP) are two of the major organisations in theUK combatting child trafficking. In depth research using their websites and relatedreading proved invaluable.In addition to researching online, I used my network ofsocial work professional groups and colleagues, I was lucky in speakingdirectly to Charlie Hedges; an authority on child trafficking who has beenawarded an MBE for his efforts, Mr Hedges provided an enormity of informationand gave advice on what would and would not be plausible. My dear friend and fellow author James Morgan Ayres alsoprovided invaluable knowledge on the country of Thailand in general, havinglived and worked in the Far East for many years. The sights, sounds and smellsof the place were all essential in creating a 3 dimensional world in the mindof the reader.Research done; all that remained was to actually write thebook, and as we all know – that’s when it really gets interesting.

{"title": "Keeping it real in fiction by Carol Cooper, author of Hampstead Fever", "date": "Tuesday 15 November 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Carol Cooper to my blog today talking about keeping it real in fiction.  Carol's book Hampstead Fever was published by Hardwick Press on 1 July 2016.Keeping it real in fiction:making the facts serve the storyBy Carol CooperOne of the wonderful things about writing novels is thefreedom to make things up. I’m so relishing this after decades of writing non-fictionin the form of journalism and books. During all this time, I shackled myself tothe facts, sticking to things that could be proven and checking everything,even those medical truths that should be self-evident after nearly forty yearsof being a doctor.My debut novel One Night at the Jacaranda changed all that. It’s a liberating experience. Now I literally make it up asI go along.  Yes, the whole shooting match - both novels sofar, the two new works in progress, and, I can safely say, every novel I willever write.There’s a socking big disclaimer at the front of my books:This is a work of fiction. All characters andevents in this work, other than those clearly in the public domain, areentirely fictitious. Any resemblance to any persons, living or dead, is purelycoincidental.Oh, I admit it was tempting, just for a moment, toimmortalise some of my most colourful patients, but I didn’t. I've made up every single character, which should reassure anyone who knows me. Do people believe me? Do they, heck! After reading my books,friends and relatives still give me sly glances followed by “So which one amI?” or “Who is this person based on?”Every novelist I know gets the same reactions. But it’s fiction, people! What’s not to get?With novels, the author makes things up, like impossiblyhandsome heroes who like animals and are as good in the kitchen as they are inthe bedroom. On a less breath-taking level, if I want giraffes andpenguins in London Zoo to be visible from my heroine’s fictional window, that’swhat I will write, even though in reality this might require knocking down afew buildings (and damn good eyesight). But some truths should not be tampered with.  I am perfectly happy for my characters to jumpinto bed with the wrong people, but they’d better catch the right bus home inthe morning.All the other real stuff, the material in the public domain,is factually correct too. So my latest novel Hampstead Fever places Flask Walk right in its natural home in Hampstead, while thelovely branches of Daunt Books are just where they are in real life. DownRosslyn Hill you’ll also find the not-at-all fictional Hampstead Butcher andProvidore, along with the prices that make it out of reach for Harriet, thestruggling freelance journalist of my novel. When my up-and-coming chef Dan got a new job at a trendy restaurant,there was no shortage of Hampstead eateries from which to choose. But, since hecomplains of poor pay and conditions, and mentions colleagues by name, it wassafer to invent a bistro for him. Hence Lolo’s in Flask Walk, which only existsin my imagination. Anxious mother Laure takes her son to toddler group, hopingto find the support she doesn’t get from her family. Alas, there she findsüber-competitive parents who only fuel her worries. Do I mention the locationof this group? Of course not. I make it up.Inventing stuff means the freedom to say what you want. Sowhen Dan has a radio interview, hoping this is the first step on the way tobecoming a celebrity chef (it isn’t), I created a fictional presenter as astand-in for the real late-night broadcaster. By the time I’d finished writingthis scene, I too was convinced that Big Zach worked for the BBC.Novels may invent a whole world within their books, but theircreations need to appear authentic. Being authentic, as the Oxford dictionaryputs it, means “Made or done in the traditional ororiginal way, or in a way that faithfully resembles an original.”And that’s not at all the same thing as being real, even ifreaders (and writers) sometimes get the two confused.About Carol CooperCarol Cooper is a doctor, journalist, and author.

Nuala's book My Sister's Bones was published in e-book by Penguin on 1 November 2016 and is published in hardback in February 2017.Crime novels that inspired meBy Nuala Ellwood1. The Raven by Edgar Allan PoeAs a teenager, I devoured the stories and poems of Edgar Allan Poe. I loved the strange sense of ‘otherness’ they conveyed and the wonderfully macabre metaphors that sent chills down the spine. I still wonder whether my teenage insomnia stemmed from Poe’s ‘sleep, those little slices of death’ line but I feel his influence on me now as a writer. I re-read his poem, The Raven, when I was writing My Sister’s Bones, and was struck at the parallels between the sinister bird who haunts the troubled man in the poem and the nightmares and hallucinations experienced by my war reporter protagonist as she battles the horrors of PTSD.2. A Demon in my View by Ruth RendellThis tells the story of Arthur Johnson, a quiet man in his late-fifties, who leads a solitary, apparently respectable life, as a book keeper for a small business in a dull London suburb. At first glance he seems an ordinary, if rather aloof, middle-aged man. But as the story unfolds, we discover that he is hiding a dark secret. Deep in the cellar of his block of flats, out of sight of his unsuspecting neighbours, is a mannequin that he periodically \"strangles\" in order to satisfy his homicidal urges. But then one night the mannequin is stolen and Arthur realises, with sickening dread, that if he wants to satisfy his urges he must now go out and find a real woman. In this twisted tale, Rendell delivers a masterly exploration into the mind of a psychopath and a chilling story of how evil can hide in plain sight.3. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor DostoevskyOne of my favourite novels of all time, Crime and Punishment depicts in excruciating detail the guilt, mental anguish and moral reasoning of a killer. I love the way Dostoevsky uses the landscape of St Petersburg, the labyrinthine streets, drinking dens and slums, to heighten the sense of desperation and panic experienced by Raskolnikov both in the build up to and the aftermath of his crime. I return to it again and again to remind myself just how powerful writing can be.4. Enduring Love by Ian McEwan McEwan takes an idyllic summer’s afternoon in which a couple, Joe and Clarissa are enjoying a picnic in the countryside and rips it apart. The horror comes out of the blue – literally – as a hot air balloon is ripped from its moorings with a ten year old boy trapped inside. Several men, including Joe, rush to help. One of them pays with his life. All are affected by the horror they have witnessed. But for Joe, the accident brings a troubled stranger into his life, marking the beginning of a dangerous obsession that threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Though not a crime novel, it is a magnificent story of obsession written by the master of literary suspense.5. Room by Emma DonoghueAs a mother with a young son, this novel particularly resonated with me. It tells the heartbreaking story of a mother trying to shield her five-year-old son from the horrors of a terrifying situation. The two are being held captive in a secured outbuilding at the bottom of their captor’s garden. The child, Jack, has never known life outside of the ‘room.’ Beautifully written from the perspective of Jack, Room constructs a world within a world, and demonstrates, not only the resilience of the human spirit, but also the powerful bond between mother and child, the love that can overcome evil.About Nuala EllwoodNuala Ellwood is the daughter of anaward-winning journalist.

I featured my review of The Exiled on 6th November, so don't forget to take a peek.My review of The MineThe MineBy Antti TuomainenPublished by Orenda Books (15 November 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633533Publisher's descriptionA hitman. Ajournalist. A family torn apart. Can he uncover the truth before it's too late?In the deadof winter, investigative reporter Janne Vuori sets out to uncover the truthabout a mining company, whose illegal activities have created an environmentaldisaster in a small town in Northern Finland. When the company's executivesbegin to die in a string of mysterious accidents, and Janne's personal lifestarts to unravel, past meets present in a catastrophic series of events thatcould cost him his life.My verdictThe Mine is an emotionally-charged thought-provoking Finnish environmental thriller. It's stunningly written and translated seamlessly - no word is out of the place and the descriptions provide an amazing sense of the chilling frozen setting. I was totally gripped throughout and struggled to put the book down (other than to sleep).Investigative reporter Janne Vuori discovers corruption, secrets and lies as he investigates a mining company in a small town in Northern Finland. His life is in danger, there's a killer on the loose and he fears that he and his family are being watched. While The Mine is essentially a thriller, it has an underlying sensitivity about it - with themes of morality and family running through the plot. When Janne's investigations put his own family life in jeopardy, he is forced to make some difficult decisions.The Mine is also a book about how our past and family can shape us and our future - and how family secrets often come back to haunt us. There's some violence, but nothing too graphic, and some unexpected revelations, twists and turns. I really felt like I cared about Janne and his family by the end - and believed in the characters as if they were real people (not all crime thrillers have that effect on me).I will admit the ending of the book 'broke' me. I finished it late one evening and it left me with a sense of discomfort and longing for more. I struggled to sleep that night - thoughts churning over in my mind about the plot, the characters and the final chapter. If you like resolution, be warned you may not be satisfied - although I do feel the author had this planned all along.This is a stunning book - yet another winner from Orenda. The Mine is a book that will stay with me for a long while (especially as I'm desperate to know what happens next...)I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow The Finnish Invasion Blog Tour!"},

When he findsa woman's body in Amsterdam Harbour, his detective instincts take over,even though it's not his jurisdiction. Warned off investigating the case, Henksoon realises he can trust nobody, as his search for the killer leads him todiscover the involvement of senior police officers, government corruption inthe highest places, Hungarian people traffickers, and a deadly threat to hisown family...My verdictOriginally The Harbour Master was self-published as three separate novellas with the same protagonist in each - covering murder, smuggling and kidnapping. Thanks to No Exit Press, these have now been combined together in one book, which works well as several interconnecting threads weave throughout the three stories.The first chapter sets the scene, tone and high quality of the book. Policeman Henk van der Pol is present when a woman's body is discovered floating in the river. Although warned off by his superiors because it's not his case, he becomes intrigued by the investigation. Gradually unravelling what seems to be corruption in high places, Henk isn't sure who he can trust.The author, Daniel Pembrey, has lived in Amsterdam, which gives The Harbour Master a very authentic feel - taking the reader right into the heart of the Dutch community with its vivid descriptions of people and places. I've never visited Amsterdam, but this book certainly makes me want to boost it up my holiday destination list.Henk is a great character, with a wealth of experience behind him and plenty of determination to get to the truth, although this means he's not always well liked by his colleagues. I liked how his family take a key role within the book, rather than simply playing a supporting one. Henk and his journalist wife Petra are contemplating retirement, but these new cases threaten their long-term plans.The Harbour Master is multi-layered crime fiction, with excellent writing and fascinating insights into Dutch politics, history and culture. There's also some dry humour to lighten what are some quite dark plots.A book to recommend to intelligent discerning crime fiction fans!I received an Advance Reader Copy.December First Monday CrimeCome alongto December’s First Monday Crime Christmas Special panel to hear the finestcrime authors in the business.

There its children lived in terror ofGordon Tallis, the home's manager.Cries inthe fire and smokeThen ConnorLaird arrived: a frighteningly intense boy who quickly became Tallis' favouritecriminal helper.

DI Ray Drake will do whatever it take to stop the murders - but he willgo even further to cover up the truth.My verdictWow, The Two O'Clock Boy is a great start to what is bound to be a brilliant crime series.Mark Hill has written a gripping & intriguing debut that kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through. It's well written, twisty, well plotted and highly addictive - very difficult to put down and filled with surprises and some unscrupulous characters.I won't give away any spoilers, but the plot focuses on Longacre Children's Home and a devastating fire 30 years earlier. It switches between the past and present as DI Ray Drake investigates a series of killings linked to the Longacre occupants. The tension builds up as the bodies pile up, and DI Drake is forced to make some difficult decisions that could affect his future and that of his family.The ending left me reeling - not wise to read it late into the night if you value your sleep! Certainly a book to challenge, make you think and chill you to the bone.I am very interested to see how this series pans out and where it goes from here. I love the London setting with many familiar landmarks and locations. Looking forward to the next one!I received an Advance Reader Copy."},
{"title": "Nasty Women - an author guest post by Alexandra Sokoloff - Blog Tour", "date": "Wednesday 9 November 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Alexandra Sokoloff to my blog today talking about 'Nasty Women', as part of her blog tour. Alexandra's latest book Bitter Moon was published by Thomas & Mercer on 1 November 2016. This is the latest in the Huntress/FBI thriller series, and ideally you should read the series in order, starting with Huntress Moon. Nasty WomenBy Alexandra SokoloffBITTER MOON, Book 4 of my Huntress MoonThrillers, is out this week, so thanks to Vicki for hosting this episode of myblog tour! To brieflycatch up those just joining us, the Huntress books are intense psychologicalsuspense, and take the reader on an interstate manhunt with a haunted FBI agenton the track of a female serial killer. Thepremise gives me a chance to turn hated casual tropes of violence against womeninside out.My killerkills men. She’s killed lots of them. For years. Buthere’s the thing. Arguably there’s never been any such thing as a female serialkiller in real life – the women that the media holds up as serial killersoperate from a completely different psychology from the men who commit what theFBI calls sexual homicide. Isn’t that fascinating? Don’t you immediately want to know why? Becauselet’s face it – women have a LOT of reasons to kill. And yet… we very, veryrarely do. I’llgive you a hint. Serial killers – those in real life, not in authors’imaginings, are serial rapists who have graduated to murder. So like rape,serial killing is statistically almost exclusively a male crime. And that factallows me to confront and explore the insidious effects of rape culture in thecontext of gripping thrillers.One ofthe questions I’m always asking myself, my readers, friends, random people onFacebook – is – “What’s going to be the tipping point? What is it going to takefor women, and society in general, to finally say, ‘Enough’?”There’sbeen such a great momentum against rape culture building in the last couple ofyears. Young college women across the US, mostly sexual assault survivors, havedone an outstanding, revolutionary service by exposing widespread officialcover-ups of rape on university campuses – particularly the systemic protectionof student athletes accused of sexual assault. These women’s efforts havelaunched Federal investigations on nearly 200 campuses to date, and haveinspired President Obama and Vice President Biden to create “It’s On Us”campaign against sexual assault on campus.So therewas the groundwork. And back in March I thought the Brock Turner case would bethe thing to really bring it home. I’m talking about the Stanford Rapist, acollege --- whose sexual assault of an unconscious college woman was onlyinterrupted by the intervention of a couple of good Samaritans – but who servedall of three months in jail courtesy of Judge Aaron Persky, a Stanford alum whowas more worried about how prison would affect the rapist than he was about howthe rape had affected and would continue to affect the survivor - and any otherwomen Brock will go on to rape. Because these guys don’t just do it once. Rapeis a serial crime. It was a perfect storm of white male athleticprivilege and an old boy justice system that routinely lets predators likeBrock Turner off.Ithought we’d finally reached critical mass of outrage on that one.But no.We were almost mad as hell and not going to take it any more. Then acombination of several police shootings of unarmed African American men and theblatant racism of Donald Trump ignited Black Lives Matter protests. And onceagain, another sort of injustice took the national spotlight away from buildingprotests against rape culture.And Iwondered – again– What is it going to take for a critical mass of women to sayNO? Why aren’t WE taking to the streets?Well,now it turns out that tipping point might be – MIGHT be – a presidentialcandidate on a hot mike gleefully recounting sexual assault, and then trying tobrush that off as “locker room talk,” even as more than a dozen women have comeforward to confirm the actual behavior, going back years.Why thatshould have been the straw to break our collective back - out of all the thingssaid candidate has said about any number of groups of people - is beyond me.But suddenly millions of women were on social media recounting their stories offirst sexual assaults, and collectively realizing that for almost all of us,there have been far too many to even recall, much less recount. And yet again(I’m thinking Anita Hill’s accusations against Clarence Thomas) women arehaving to have this national conversation in which the men who love us have tobe walked through how ubiquitous this abuse is for all of us.And thenin the last Presidential debate, the sexual-predator-in-chief called the otherpresidential candidate, the sane one, “Such a nasty woman.” Icing on aparticularly lurid cake. Because we all know what he meant, right? I’ve beencalled all kinds of variations of “nasty woman” this summer. Every time I postanything political, which is pretty much all I’ve been posting for a year now,I know I’ll have to take time throughout my work day to deal with the trollsthat swarm to my posts and call me (and many of my commenters) all thosevariations of “nasty woman.”“Nastywoman” might just be the rallying cry we all needed. So many of us embracedthose words with – I think relief isthe word - because it was finally just out there. Have an opinion? You’re anasty woman. Protest against oppression? What a nasty woman. Want equal pay forequal work? You nasty woman. Confront any man about anything that might bebothering you? Nasty, nasty woman.I was thrilledthis week that one of my favorite reviewers included this line in his review: “Alexandra Sokoloff’s feminist crime series features theultimate “nasty woman” (in the best sense of the word).”Nastywomen are the finest women I know. And I hope – I really hope – all us nastywomen are finally mad enough not to take it anymore. (As a headline read theother day: “Trump Finally Pissed Off theWrong Woman. All of Them.”)I’ll bewearing my NASTY WOMAN tank top this Tuesday, and praying for the fate of theworld.But it’spretty clear to me, my nasty woman killer still has a lot of work to do.About Alexandra SokoloffAlexandraSokoloff is the Thriller Award-winning and Bram Stoker, Anthony, and BlackQuill Award-nominated author of the supernatural thrillers The Harrowing,The Price, The Unseen, Book of Shadows, The Shifters, and The SpaceBetween; The Keepers paranormal series, and the ThrillerAward-nominated, Amazon bestselling Huntress/FBI Thrillers series (HuntressMoon, Blood Moon, Cold Moo, Bitter Moon), which has been optioned fortelevision.

{"title": "Writing a 'can't put down thriller' by Rob Sinclair - Blog Tour", "date": "Tuesday 8 November 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Rob Sinclair to my blog today with his top tips on writing a 'can't put down thriller', as part of his blog tour. Rob's latest book Dark Fragments is published by Bloodhound Books today (8 November 2016).My top tips on writing a 'can't put down thriller'By Rob SinclairWithpublication of my fourth book imminent, a question I still get asked regularlywhen introducing myself to people as a writer is how do you actually go aboutwriting a book? It’s a question I’m sure if I wound back the clock ten yearsI’d have been keen to hear the answer too as well. The thought of constructinga novel that’s 100,000 words long is not just daunting, but seeminglyimpossible to many people, yet many do accomplish this feat, and I’m sure eachand every writer has their own unique way of crafting a story.So how do Ido it? I’ll put it really simply; I write one word at a time until the book isfinished...Ok, so ofcourse there’s a bit more to it than that, so here are some of my top tips:1) Justget stuck in!I say ifyou spend less time worrying about process and more time actually getting yourfingers dancing across the keyboard, you’re already on the right track. For me,writing breeds plot and once I’m in a groove ideas and actions and locationsand characters seem to flow. I’m sure not everyone is the same but for methere’s not substitute for actually just getting stuck in and starting towrite. I’ve drafted six books now, and am half way through the first draft of aseventh, and I certainly feel like I’m getting into quite a regimented writingprocess now. What I absolutely don’t do is start off by thinking out andanalysing a fully formed plot with all the twists and turns and with detailedcharacter profiles etc etc. I know a lot of writers do this, creating story mapsand the like, but it just doesn't suit me at all. Coming back to that originalquestion (how do you actually go about writing a book?), I think the thing thata lot of non-writers struggle with is that concept of visualising a whole plotin the first place. So I don’t. I just get an idea (it could be the openingscene or it could be the central character or it could be the main plot theme),and I just run with it and slowly flesh the plot and characters as I’m writing.Yes that might seem strange and you could say it’s leaving a lot to chance, butI think as long as I have an understanding of where I’m trying to get to (the BIGplot twist is usually one that I think you have to know early on), thenoften the rest just seems to fall into place quite naturally.2)Setting goalsSomewriters hate this idea, but for me, it keeps me focused and there’s no betterfeeling than setting a goal and then beating it! So I regularly set myself atarget of when I want that draft written by, when I want the editing completed,when I want to publish even. Without goals and targets there’s just too muchscope to drift. When I’m drafting I set myself a word target of 4,000 a day,which, unless I have a complete brain freeze (which does happen every sooften!), I generally find is easily achievable. Given that when I set out I’maiming to hit 80,000 words for that first draft, you can see that it reallydoesn’t take me that long - generally 4-6 weeks, depending on how manynon-writing days get in the way (usually involving looking after the kids!). Ialso find that splitting the book down into these daily chunks takes away thatdaunting prospect of actually writing a full length novel. As long as I knowwhat I want to write that day (which is usually just two or three chapters)then I’m happy and generally relaxed, even if I have no idea what’s coming intwo or three day’s time.3) KillerendingsThose firsttwo tips deal with the process of writing itself, but what about the thrillingpart? What I’ve always set out to do is write books that people want to devourin one sitting, and to do that you need hooks. I think of this in three parts;i) the early hook that gets readers interested in the first place, ii) that bigtwist at the end that no-one (or very few people hopefully!) saw coming, andiii) perhaps most importantly is the stuff that comes in the 40 or 50 chaptersin between! It’s not possible in all cases, but what I try to do is make asmany chapter’s end with either a twist, a revelation or at least an element ofintrigue, to make the reader want to carry on. Just ending a chapter with ‘andthen they all went to bed for a good night’s sleep,’ doesn’t really cut it inthis genre!4)ConflictProbablythe biggest single concept for fiction in the crime/thriller genre is conflict.Conflict should seep through every page and ooze through every characters’pours. You don’t have to go overboard and make every element of conflict worldchanging, because conflict can be a relatively simple concept, but everycharacter needs this, whether it’s internal or external, past, present orfuture, personal or professional.5) Writewhat you knowOne of themost well-worn cliches about writing, but there is some truth to this. Ok, somy Enemy series books were about a black-ops assassin who was a trained killingmachine. I can reveal that I have never had such training and have never killedanother human being before. But, I do feel I know the thriller genre sufficientto write about it because of all the books I’ve read and the films I’ve enjoyedover the years. And my books do still have a lot of areas in them that comefrom my own experiences; the most obvious being locations, but also certaincharacters, or in the least their traits. I think for me, the key is that youshould stick to writing in a genre and in a style that feels natural for you,rather than trying to force yourself to write something for the sake of it.Many people say I should write about financial crime because of my past job asfraud investigator, but for some reason I hate that idea! (Maybe because thatwas a real job!). Others try to copycat a particular style, or try tofit into a genre that is hugely popular, but in which they have little realworld interest, just for the potential commercial upside. Kudos if they make itwork, but I’d much rather just write what feels comfortable me - a book thatI’d like to read myself, basically.About Rob SinclairRob is theauthor of the Enemy series of espionage thrillers featuring embattled agentCarl Logan.

The other book is The Mine by Antti Tuomainen. I'm featuring my review of The Mine on 13th November, so don't forget to join me on that day too.My review of The ExiledThe ExiledBy Kati HiekkapeltoPublished by Orenda Books (15 November 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633519Publisher's descriptionAnna Feketereturns to the Balkan village of her birth for a relaxing summer holiday. Butwhen her purse is stolen and the thief is found dead on the banks of the river,Anna is pulled into a murder case. Her investigation leads straight to her ownfamily, to closely guarded secrets concealing a horrendous travesty of justicethat threatens them all. As layer after layer of corruption, deceit and guiltare revealed, Anna is caught up in the refugee crisis spreading like wildfireacross Europe. How long will it take before everything explodes?My verdictThe Exiled is a slow-burning chilling crime novel filled with social conscience. Translated exceptionally well by David Hackston, this book is beautifully written, with vivid descriptions and a highly topical backdrop - looking at the refugee crisis in Europe. In Kati Hiekkapelto's previous book (The Defenceless), Anna Fekete was investigating crime in the chilling setting of frozen Finland. In The Exiled, Anna has returned to her roots in steaming Serbia (near the Hungarian border), where Hungarians, Serbians and Romanies are living side by side but with tension between the different communities.Anna's relaxing family holiday takes a sinister turn when her handbag is stolen. The thief - a member of the local Romany community - is found dead by the river and, although her bag is recovered, key contents are missing, including her passport. The local police department doesn't seem very interested in the crime, so Anna decides to take matters into her own hands using her expertise as a police investigator. Anna's research leads her to unravel corruption in the local community, linked to the refugee crisis and illegal immigration. As she reveals more about the thief's identity, she discovers some unexpected revelations about her family's past and begins to question her own 'sense of belonging'. She's of Hungarian origin but has lived as a legal 'outsider' in Finland since she was a child. She has never really lived within the Serbian community, even though her parents had settled there. This is a thread that continues from the previous book, but The Exiled can easily be read as a standalone.The Exiled certainly kept me guessing until the end. Just when I thought I had it sussed, there was another twist thrown into the plot. But this book is about much more than the crime and Anna's investigations. Kati Hiekkapelto isn't afraid to tackle controversial social issues, going beyond the reach of most crime fiction, with a taut compelling writing style, an amazing sense of location and a multi-layered thought-provoking plot.I received an Advance Reader Copy.Follow the Finnish Invasion Blog Tour!"},

But when the hospital bills start to rackup, she has no choice but to take her daughter along on a job that will makeher a fast buck. And that’s when things start to go wrong. The fugitive she’sassigned to haul back to court is none other than JT, Lori’s former mentor –the man who taught her everything she knows … the man who also knows thesecrets of her murky past.Not only isJT fighting a child exploitation racket operating out of one of Florida’sbiggest theme parks, Winter Wonderland, a place where ‘bad things neverhappen’, but he’s also mixed up with the powerful Miami Mob.

When they’re ambushedat a gas station, the stakes go from high to stratospheric, and things becomepersonal.My verdictI read most of Deep Down Dead in one day, in one sitting, in just a few hours. It's a BRILLIANT action thriller! Sexy, gripping, fast-paced, fresh... and definitely a page turner that will keep you reading late into the night or all day long (trust me - I know from experience!).Steph Broadribb (aka crimethrillergirl) has created a fantastic rollercoaster read. Think Stephanie Plum (Janet Evanovitch) & Jack Reacher (Lee Child) rolled into one.Deep Down Dead has an authentic American feel with a fantastic plot, vivid setting and amazing writing that puts you right into the heart of the action - a clear winning formula. Yes, violence is an integral part of the plot, but this book doesn't feel violent as it's so well written - it's like watching an expertly choreographed action sequence in a film that's vital & engaging... which means I also have to mention that this book would make a perfect transition to the big screen.Steph Broadribb's lead character Lori Anderson is an all-action girl, but also has a feminine side. I love the inclusion of Lori's nine-year-old daughter Dakota (who has leukaemia) - this gives Lori a focus other than her bounty hunting, a sense of responsibility and a past that softens her, so she's believable and someone you want to get to know. It also means you're in for an emotional journey too - this is a book that will make you cry, laugh, scream, wince and hold your breath. And as for JT... WOW, we want more of him!Deep Down Dead heralds the start of a new series. It's contains everything you want in an action thriller - a strong female lead, sexy potential partner, thrilling plot and a lot of heart. This book is going to fly its way up the charts! Bring on the next Lori Anderson book!!!!I received an Advance Reader Copy."},

Nancy opened her eyes. Blinked several times. Apain seared through her head. She could feel fluid. No. She was lying in fluid.When a bodyis discovered in a burnt-out barn in the Warwickshire countryside, DI WillJackman is called to investigate.NancyFaraday wakes up on the kitchen floor. The house has been broken into and herboyfriend is missing. As the case unravels, DI Jackman realises that nothing isquite as it appears and everyone, it seems, has a secret.Can hediscover the truth behind the body in the fire, and track down the killerbefore Nancy becomes the next victim?My verdict Beneath the Ashes is beautifully written crime fiction. It's well-plotted and gripping, with a lot of emotion at its core.Jane Isaac is a talented writer and has created an authentic police procedural thriller with a fascinating background. The vivid descriptions put me right into the heart of the Warwickshire setting  - and the well-researched intelligent plot kept me engrossed from beginning to end.DI Will Jackman is a brilliant & very realistic character - certainly someone I have taken a shine to (and I'm sure many other readers have too). He cares about the victims and is determined to get to the truth - possibly due to his own tragic family circumstances, which weigh heavily on his mind.This is the second in Jane Isaac's DI Jackson series, but I am sure this could easily be read as a standalone.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Susan Moody", "date": "Monday 31 October 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Susan Moody to my blog today as my Author in the Spotlight. Susan's first Penny Wanawake book Penny Black was republished in February 2016 by Williams & Whiting.PennyWanawake was the first black female protagonist in crime fiction. Was it easyto get her accepted by readers in the 1980s? The Pennyseries was received enthusiastically by the great discerning British readingpublic!  There was never any discrimination of any kind, especiallybecause the reviews were so ecstatic – this was back in the happy days when allthe major newspapers and magazines, both intellectual and popular, took crimefiction seriously. So most weeks a paper like the Sunday Times or the Observerwould devote part of their Book Pages to reviewing crime novels. It was muchharder to get Penny accepted anywhere else, though eventually the books werepublished in the States.  There were even film options, though they werenever taken up.  Most of the rest of the world remained indifferent,more'sthe pity.  The point about Penny Wanawake was that she was the firstfemale protagonist who was feisty, witty, humorous and confident, as well asbeing beautiful.  Nor did she need a police contact to help with thesolutions to the murders.  Much of the wit depends on clever punning andliterary references, and many of her comments and reactions were consideredhilarious by the readers, but remained untranslatable. If you were‘creating' Penny for the first time today, would you change her at all?If Ichanged her, she wouldn't be Penny, would she?  But neither would I createher today.  We live in a far more complex world than the one into which Pennystrode thirty years ago, though she remains as amusing and clever as she alwaysdid.  Which is why I'm so pleased that go-ahead publishers Williams &Whiting have seen fit to reissue the entire series, giving a new set of readersthe chance to get to know her.Have youhad to make any/many changes to your original book to fit in with contemporarysociety? I did toneright down her somewhat liberated attitude to sexual encounters (I originallyintended her to be a sort of female answer to James Bond and his type!) afterthe first two or three books, because the scourge of AIDS appeared on thescene.  Otherwise, I believe she stands as tall now as she did then and wefelt that no changes were requiredDo youthink crime fiction, and female protagonists in particular, have changed overthe years?Definitely. There were very few female protagonists when I started writing, Miss JaneMarple of St Mary Mead was the principal character – and almost the only onethe average reader had ever heard of, which is why the Sunday Times originallyinstituted a competition to find a new and original protatgonist for thegenre.  Now, there are outstanding female protagonists all over the place– Kinsey Millhone and V.I. Washawski, are prime examples. As forcrime fiction itself, years ago Dorothy Sayers stated that the genre would dieout because there was no place for it to go, every option had beenexplored.  How wrong she was!  The genre has  becomeincreasingly gritty over the years, while at the same time new and ingeniousmethods of human disposal abound in all kinds of sub-genres, such aspsychological, historical, 'cosy', police procedural and so on.How does itfeel to have your book republished over 30 years on? Absolutelybrilliant!  I'm so delighted that  Mike Linane, the dynamic CEO ofW&W, decided to start his company by taking her on and treating her sowell, with new and eye-catching covers, and new introductions by me.  It'slike welcoming home a long-lost and beloved relative. What canyou tell new readers about your Penny Wanawake books?I'm oftenasked about the genesis of Penelope Wanawake.  It began when I foundmyself living in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in the Sixties.  This was at thebeginning of the civil rights movement, when at last people were waking up tothe unjustices of a system which allowed the rights of the black population tobe ignored. (As, I'm afraid, they are still being). Those werethe years of civil disobedience as exemplified by Rosa Parks refusing to giveup her seat on the bus so a white person could have it.  She wasn't thefirst to decline to do so, but she became an important symbol of the movement.Then came the atrocious killing of three young civil rights workers inMississippi.  In Oak Ridge, black people couldn't buy a house in a 'white'area.  They couldn't swim in the same public pools ort sattend the sameschools.  My husband and I joined the NAACP (the National Association forthe Advancement of Coloured People) and held several meetings in our house. The Klan came into town, their faceless hoods a terrifying sight calculated tostrike fear into the heart.  We were watched. Came theday we were sitting – with the blinds down – in our sitting room when wenoticed a weird light shining from outside.  We peeked out and discoveredthat a cross was burning on our front lawn.  This was seriously scarystuff.  Even more so was the incident when I pulled up at traffic lights,heavily pregnant and with my toddler in the back.  Suddenly, a jeepscreeched to a halt alongside me and when I looked over at it, there were fourgrinning rednecks staring at me, each one of them with a rifle across hisknees, pointing at me.When I gotback to England, creating the character of Penny seemed almost anobligation. About Susan MoodySusanMoody's Penny Wanawake series – reissued by dynamic new publisher Williams& Whiting – propelled her into the ranks of crime-writing some thirty plusyears ago, where she's happily remained ever since.  In that time,she's produced more than thirty-five books, mostly crime, including a secondseries character called Cassandra Swann (soon to be re-published by W&W),plus many stand-alones and short stories.  She's served as Chair ofthe Crime Writers Association, President of the International Association ofCrime Writers, Visiting Fellow at the University of Tasmania, Visiting Fellowat the University of Copenhagen, Writing Tutor at HMP Bedford. She recentlyfounded the hugely successful one-day crime fiction event, Deal Noir, in Deal,Kent, and will be hosting our third one on 25 March 2017.  About Williams and WhitingWilliams& Whiting is a new publishing company formed by Mike Linane who is alsoco-organiser of the Deal Noir and Bodies From The Library crime fictionfestivals. Williams & Whiting plan to not onlyre-issue many traditional crime novels from the last forty years but also tosign debut authors of both fiction and non-fiction. Mike says“I’m open to all ideas. For us, the important thing is that thebook must simply be a thumping good read.

{"title": "Black Rabbit Hall by Eve Chase", "date": "Saturday 29 October 2016", "text": "Black Rabbit HallBy Eve ChasePublished by Penguin (16 June 2016)ISBN: 978-1405919326Publisher's descriptionOne goldenfamily. One fateful summer. Four lives changed forever.Amber Altonknows that the hours pass differently at Black Rabbit Hall, her London family'scountry estate where no two clocks read the same. Summers there are perfect,timeless. Not much ever happens. Until, one stormy evening in 1968, it does.The idyllicworld of the four Alton children is shattered. Fiercely bonded by the tragicevents, they grow up fast. But when a glamorous stranger arrives, theseloyalties are tested. Forbidden passions simmer. And another catastrophelooms...Decadeslater, Lorna and her fiancé wind their way through the countryside searchingfor a wedding venue. Lorna is drawn to a beautiful crumbling old house shehazily remembers from her childhood, feels a bond she does not understand. Whenshe finds a disturbing message carved into an old oak tree by one of the Altonchildren, she begins to realise that Black Rabbit Hall's secret history is asdark and tangled as its woods, and that, much like her own past, it must bebrought into the light.My verdictBlack Rabbit Hall has been sitting on my bookshelf for a while. Now I wish I had read it sooner. It's a beautifully written tale of grief, family secrets, lies and forbidden love.This is a powerful story of the Alton family in the 1960s and, specifically, teenager Amber. Decades later, Lorna stumbles across Black Rabbit Hall, a large dilapidated house in Cornwall, with her fiancé when they look for a wedding venue.  Lorna feels like she remembers the old house from her childhood, but has no idea why.Black Rabbit Hall is an emotional read that left me in tears. The wonderful characters and stunning setting pulled me in straight away, with vivid descriptions and powerful dialogue. I loved how the two threads wound seamlessly together, as Amber's tragic story was gradually revealed.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.Lie With MeBy Sabine DurantPublished by Mulholland Books (July 2016)ISBN: 978-1473608337Publisher's descriptionIt starts with a lie. The kind we've all told - to a formeracquaintance we can't quite place but still, for some reason, feel the need toimpress. The story of our life, embellished for the benefit of the happilymarried lawyer with the kids and the lovely home.And the next thing you know, you're having dinner at theirhouse, and accepting an invitation to join them on holiday - swept up in theirperfect life, the kind you always dreamed of...Which turns out to be less than perfect. But by the timeyou're trapped and sweating in the relentless Greek sun, burning to escape thetension all around you - by the time you start to realise that, however painfulthe truth might be, it's the lies that cause the real damage...... well, by then, it could just be too late.My verdictLie With Me is an unsettling novel of deception, complex relationships and lies. It kept me guessing all the way through. I didn't know who to trust or who to believe.Paul Morris, the protagonist, isn't someone you're meant to like. He's an arrogant, self-obsessed and unpleasant character who's only interested in himself. When he meets an old school acquaintance, Andrew, he creates a whole fantasy world in which he's successful and popular - which couldn't be further from the truth. As Paul embarks on a relationship with Alice, a wealthy widow, and tries to worm his way into her life, the lies keep on coming. As expected, things go horribly wrong.Lie With Me has a great sense of claustrophobia as everything closes in on Paul. Once the lies started, there was no going back. He dug himself into a deeper and deeper hole. Past lies, present lies - it didn't matter. They were all going to haunt him one day, especially as he embellished the truth so much.I raced through Lie With Me, from start to finish. It's a fantastic gripping psychological thriller that really gets you inside the main character's head. Something I did love about Paul is that he was actually a completely honest narrator, a complete contrast to his role within the plot itself.The sense of unease builds up gradually until I was so hooked that there was no turning away.  And by the end of the book, my mind felt like it had been totally manipulated by a clever plot and great characterisation.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

I have heard great things about this book!Himself ExtractChapter 6There’s a light on in thelibrary and Mahony decides not to ignore Mrs Cauley’s summons to join her for anightcap. He finds her propped up in bed, wearing a poker visor and playingsolitaire.  She has listened all eveningfor his footfall in the hall, although she’d never admit to it.Mahony turfs a pile of papersout of an armchair and pulls off his boots.‘Here.’ Mrs Cauley fishes abottle out from under her pillow. ‘Pour us a drop of the hard stuff.’Mahony pours her a tooth mug andtakes a china cup for himself.There’s a nice silence justwhile they drink. The reading lamp beside the bed casts a mellow tent of lightover the two of them. The dead and the mice draw in to watch, lulled and quiet.The damp settles in the corners of the room and stretches itself out along thewallpaper.Mrs Cauley peers over at him.‘So how’s tricks?’ She collects up the cards, as quick as a croupier.‘Not bad. I had a good time atthe pub with the boys.’‘The boys, is it?’ She shufflesand squares the pack. ‘Watch yourself. There’s not a trustworthy soul in thistown. Every one of them has at least two faces.’Mahony puts his feet up on thebed and looks over at her. The visor shades her eyes but he’s certain she’staking everything in. ‘They seem sound enough.’‘Will they still drink with youwhen they know who you are? Do they know who you are, Mahony?’Mahony gets up and pours himselfanother. He ignores the empty mug in her outstretched hand.Mrs Cauley fixes him with herbest poker face. ‘So you didn’t ask your new pals at Kerrigan’s Bar whathappened to your mammy?’Mahony swirls the bad whiskey.It dances up the sides of the cup. ‘I didn’t.’Mrs Cauley nods. ‘That’s ashame. They’d have spun you a story about Orla leaving town.’‘It would be no story.’‘So you believe she left townnow?’‘If she were dead I’d know aboutit.’‘You’re right of course. She’dbe over there by the fire- place, knitting.’Mahony knocks back his whiskeyin one hit, before it can take the skin off the roof of his mouth. ‘She couldstill be alive.’‘Because you can’t see her?’He shrugs.‘The dead are like cats, Mahony.You of all people should know that. They don’t always come when they’recalled.’Mahony shakes his head. ‘Theycould be holding her somewhere.’Mrs Cauley raises herself up onher pillows. ‘For twenty- six years, Mahony?’‘It happens. I read about somekid found in a woodshed.’‘You think that’s possible? Alive wire like Orla in a woodshed?’ Mrs Cauley speaks evenly. ‘You think your motherwas murdered and so do I. Now I thought we’d established that?’Johnnie strolls through theFrench doors, throws his faint hat down on the end of the bed and disappears.In a moment Mahony sees a plume of spectral pipe smoke coming from behind alarge stack of encyclopaedias in the far corner.Mahony nods. ‘So what’s next?’‘We play to our strengths, isn’tthat how the best detectives work? With my mind and your unnatural talentswe’ll have this case cracked in no time.’Mahony gets up, takes her cupand his and puts them on the bedside table. He pours another measure into each andwonders if he’ll ever feel his feet again. ‘All right, Miss Marple, but, firstof all, how do you know so much about my unnatural talents?’She grins. ‘Husband number fourwas an eminent clairvoyant.’‘Four, is it? Jesus. So thatwould be the dead fella with the moustache?’She shakes her head and smiles.‘No, Johnnie was my fiancé. We never married, although he was the mostbeloved.’Mahony puts a drink into herhand. ‘He was the one that got away?’‘Something like that,’ says MrsCauley. She frowns. ‘I want to try something, Mahony.’ She takes off her visorand reaches for a headscarf hung over the bedpost. ‘Is there a breeze tonight?’Mahony looks at her. ‘God knows.The night is still.’‘We’ll give it a go anyways,although it’s better with a drop of wind to get it started.’Mrs Cauley sidles to the edge ofthe bed. ‘Help me to get standing.’‘Where are we going?’‘Did you know, Mahony, thatliterature can be very illuminating?’Mrs Cauley reaches for herwalking frame and with Mahony’s help moves her legs off the bed and puts on herslippers. With great effort she stands and Mahony sees how small she is, notquite five feet tall and the weight of dry hide and honeycombed bone alone.She sways, curved and calcifiedby time, smiling up at him. ‘Open the doors, Mahony.’The French doors are stuck fastand blossoming with mould but eventually they give and the night air falls in aroundMahony as if it’s been waiting with its face pressed against the glass.‘That’s it. Throw them wide.’The night air stalks into theroom and starts to tease the dust along the skirting boards.Mrs Cauley takes a step forward,stumbling a little in her carpet slippers. ‘Look around you,’ she whispers.‘The room is changing. See? The lights are burning brighter? Can’t you feel it?The books want to tell you something. They want to help.’And then Mahony feels it.The books, the papers and themagazines: all of them pulsing with a faint heartbeat. They’re watching him,holding their breath. Mahony suddenly wants to shout against the pressure ofall of these waiting words.Mrs Cauley turns to Mahony andlowers her voice. ‘I last did this when Shauna’s mother left for England. Iknew exactly what she was up to when LadyChatterley’s Lover started snapping at my ankles. To say nothing of thefact that Ibsen flew across the room and nearly took the head off me.’ Sheknots her headscarf grimly. ‘It was ADoll’s House, so I know she won’t be back.’Johnnie emerges from a darkcorner. The ghost of a smile teases the ragged curtains of his dim moustache;with a nod to Mahony he lies down on the floor and glides under the bed.The breeze whisks a flurry ofplay scripts up into the air where they drift in graceful arcs. As Mahonywatches, their movements begin to change. They start to circle the room, slowlyat first, then picking up speed until they whirr past with the dedication ofWall of Death bikers. Soon light pamphlets of philosophical thought start tojoin them, skidding across the floor and fluttering up into the whirling cloudof paper. Slim volumes of difficult poems come next, scuttling out from darkcorners and flapping headlong into the swirling gyre. Even the most aloofclassics join in, shedding their covers and flinging themselves, one after theother, into the vortex.In the middle stands Mrs Cauley,clinging to her walking frame.Then all at once the cyclonestops and the wind rushes out of the French doors.And everything falls down to theground.Johnniesprings out from under the bed and, with a look of profound effort on his face,blowsa sheet of paper through the airand into the outstretched hands of Mrs Cauley.‘Close the window, Mahony,’ shesays. ‘We’ve got something.’Johnnie collapses, flickering.MrsCauley studies the sheet of paper. ‘Now that’s some class of a hint.’Johnnie curls up at her feetlike a dying beetle. Sometimes twitching out one long limb, sometimes moaningsoundlessly.‘What is it?’ Mahony wadesthrough drifts of papers.‘It’s a playbill, Mahony.’He reads her name on it. ‘Youwere in this play?’‘I’m right there.’Mahony looks at the playbill. Inthe photograph a dark- haired girl stands smiling with her head tilted and herhands on her hips. Johnnie stops twitching and gets up off the floor. Hestraightens his waistcoat and tries to put his arm around her.‘That’s you?’‘That was me.’ She puts her handup to her head and touches the few white hairs remaining on her naked little head.Mahony spots her wig, caught onthe leg of an upturned hat stand. He brushes it off and hands it to her.She takes it and smiles, hereyes bright with checked tears. ‘Pour us a drink, kiddo.’Back in bed with a whiskey, MrsCauley watches the dust settle. She sucks at her teeth. ‘Shauna will behopping. She’ll have to run the broom around the corners. She won’t like that,the idle mare.’The room is demolished; many ofthe larger stacks remain standing but the floor is littered with piles ofpapers and broken books.Mahony hands the playbill backto her. ‘The Playboy of the Western World,by John Millington Synge.’‘A great play by a great man,’Mrs Cauley says, smoothing the edges of the paper gently.Johnnie smiles at her from theend of the bed.‘But you’re wondering,’ shemurmurs, ‘what this play has to do with our investigation?’Mahony looks outside. It’snearly dawn and he’s buckled on the worst kind of whiskey and in no fit statefor guessing games. Somewhere in his flittered mind he marvels at Mrs Cauley’stolerance of cheap liquor, for, apart from the jaunty slant of her wig, she’sas bright as a blackbird.‘And here it is.’ She taps theplaybill on her lap. ‘The St Patrick’s annual fundraising production presents apremium opportunity for the amateur detective.’Mahony fights a wave of nausea.‘I don’t get you.’‘Every man and his mother rollsinto town for it – they all come, it’s an event.’Johnnie gets up and ramblesthrough a knoll of pamphlets to the French doors to watch the sun rise behindthe trees. His face is glowing. Mahony has never seen a dead man appearhappier.Mrs Cauley looks thoughtful.‘First off, we’ll use the auditions to quiz the hell out of them. They’ll bethere in droves, lining up ready for a good interrogation.’Johnnie nods primly andstraightens his tie.‘Then we use the play to flauntyou, kiddo. To keep you right under their noses, in their line of sight,’ saysMrs Cauley, jubilantly. ‘We put you centre stage.’Johnnie takes a bow.Mahony stares at her. ‘Ah now –Jaysus, I can’t act.’‘Think about it, Mahony.’ Sheleans forward in the bed. ‘It won’t be long before they work out who you are,if some of them haven’t already. You’re the spit of your mother: the same bigwounded eyes and damaged little smile.’Mahony squints at her; he hasn’tthe strength to argue.‘You can only remind them ofOrla and, no offence, Orla is the last person this town wants reminding of.’Mahony nods. ‘Fair enough.’‘So you parading about on thatstage as large as life will wind the bastards right up.’ She pats her quiltgleefully and chuckles. ‘Then we sit back and let them give themselves away.Get them rattled enough and someone’s bound to point the finger.’‘So I act in the play?’‘You do. Have you another plan?’Johnnie twitches his moustache inMahony’s direction in an attempt at a sympathetic smile.Mrs Cauley narrows her eyes atMahony. ‘Are you the kind of cowboy to run from trouble?’ There’s a bad kind ofdelight in her voice.Mahony laughs and shakes hishead.‘So let’s ride headlong into townwith our guns blazing.’Mrs Cauley holds out her mug.‘Set ’em up.’Mahony reaches forwards andpours out the last of the whiskey, wondering if the feeling will ever return tohis fingers.‘A toast to you, my leading man.And to our investigation.’ Mrs Cauley downs her drink in one, her eyes hardly watering.She grins, wickedly. ‘And to the straight-up joy of getting Mulderrig’sbollocks in a twist.’HimselfBy Jess KiddPublished by Canongate Books (27th October 2016)ISBN: 978-1782118459Publisher's descriptionWhen Mahonyreturns to Mulderrig, a speck of a place on Ireland's west coast, he bringsonly a photograph of his long-lost mother and a determination to do battle withthe lies of his past.No one -living or dead - will tell Mahony what happened to the teenage mother whoabandoned him as a baby, despite his certainty that more than one of thevillagers knows the sinister truth.BetweenMulderrig's sly priest, its pitiless nurse and the caustic elderly actressthrowing herself into her final village play, this beautiful and darkly comic debutnovel creates an unforgettable world of mystery, bloody violence and buriedsecrets.Did you follow the Blog Tour?"},

Will it bring answers, or morequestions? And what if the person she can rely on the least… is herself?My verdictThe Day She Can't Forget is a slow-burning psychological thriller filled with secrets and lies.Zeb has gaps in her memory after she is found wandering along a deserted road in Scotland. Slowly she starts to recall snippets of information but not how they all fit together. As she delves into the past, her search uncovers more than she bargains for and no longer knows who to trust.The Day She Can't Forget provided some intriguing reading with a lot of plot packed into its pages. One story thread follows Zeb in her quest to discover the truth about why she was in Scotland and what happened to her there. Another focuses on Alma, a student in the 1970s who had lived a sheltered life, cushioned by overprotective parents, until she arrived in the hustle and bustle of London. How their two stories are intertwined was gradually revealed as the book progressed - and provided some twisty revelations.The Day She Can't Forget should appeal to psychological thriller fans who enjoy time-shift plots.

{"title": "My Typical Writing Day by Michelle Davies - Blog Tour", "date": "Thursday 20 October 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Michelle Davies to my blog today talking about her 'typical writing day', as part of her blog tour.  Michelle's book Gone Astray is published in paperback by Pan Macmillan today (20 October 2016).My typical writing dayBy Michelle DaviesThe title of this blog post is a bit of anoxymoron because, in my world, there is no such thing as a typical writing day!My day job is that of a journalist – I writefeatures for women’s magazines such as MarieClaire and Stylist and I also docopywriting for some high street retailers. So my writing day usually dependson what freelance commissions I’ve got on the go and which looming deadline mustbe met first.Being an author has to fit around my dayjob, so I am – for want of a better description – a ‘binge writer’ when itcomes to novels. I usually spend two or three weeks working flat-out on my book,then stop and go back to the day job when the work demands it.But when I’m in a novel phase, so to speak,my writing day is pretty consistent. First I drop my daughter off at schoolaround 8.50am – luckily for me, her school is on our street so our commute isabout a minute on a good day, two minutes if we’re dawdling!

{"title": "Creating Characters by Anne Coates - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Thursday 13 October 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Anne Coates to my blog today for her Dancers in the Wind blog tour to talk about creating characters. Dancers in the Wind is being published by Urbane TODAY (13th October 2016).Creating charactersBy Anne CoatesA few years ago I went to the funeral of agood friend’s mother and knew it was probable that my older self would confrontthe boyfriend of my teenage years as he is my friend’s cousin. In the chapel, Ilooked around but couldn’t see anyone vaguely resembling the eighteen year oldI went out with. Then a man a few rows in front of me touched his hair in sucha way that immediately I knew it was him.This is something that I observe in people– the physical actions that give them away. Even if they were heavily disguisedas they might be, especially in crime fiction. Many people are recognised bytheir walk alone and this is something I’m very aware of when creating characters.  And, of course, my friends offer me (perhapsunknowingly) valuable quirks and traits that I can appropriate.For Dancersin the Wind the first three characters emerged from an interview Iconducted for the News of the Worldcolour supplement.  Those three realpeople were transformed, rewritten and (hopefully) fictionalised out of allrecognition. I have covered my relationship to Hannah, the journalist, inHannah and Me (insert link). The other two – the prostitute and the policeofficer – ceased to be interviewees and became my creations. From that trio Iformed the world they inhabited with colleagues, family, friends ­– and enemies.For me the joy of creating a cast list hitsa peak when the characters take over and reveal different facets of theirpersonalities that I hadn’t thought of before. Sometimes I wake in the middleof the night with an insight, a nudge from a character and quickly make a noteso all is not lost in the morning light. Creating characters is a bit like tryingout a new cookery recipe – adding a pinch of spice here, a teaspoon of malicethere, so many grams of violence, whipping up a soufflé of emotions… and it’sfun. But sometimes it’s downright scary. My nasty characters terrify me.Names play an important part. I love howDickens uses names as a comment on a character’s personality or calling. MrGradgrind immediately comes to mind as do Scrooge and Uriah Heap. At times whenI’m writing, a character emerges with a name, however usually I check the mostpopular names for the year the character was born especially as my first twobooks are set in the 90s. Nothing is more irritating than someone being namedafter a celebrity who didn’t exist then!One mistake I made – though not a heinoussin – was calling a baby after a friend’s now grown up son. When I mentionedthis to his brother, he was insistent that he should also appear as acharacter. And he does, in Death’s SilentJudgement but I won’t give any spoilers. I also study photographs. both those I havetaken and from searches on the internet, as a good way of creating acharacter’s physical appearance. Similarly I watch people when I am travellingon buses or trains. I may have a book open in front of me but the chances areI’m sizing up another passenger, and listening to conversations going on aroundme. How a character speaks is fundamental and part of their personality.Dialogue is a great way of revealing more about a character.As I am now pondering the third book in thetrilogy, some characters who have been “sleepers” in books one and two arecoming to the fore. For them it’s time to take centre stage when the curtainrises and the spotlight shines on them.

{"title": "Writing Action Scenes by Paul Finch - Strangers Blog Tour", "date": "Wednesday 5 October 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Paul Finch to my blog today, for his Strangers Blog Tour. Paul has some top tips on writing action sequences, followed by my review of his latest book. Strangers was published by Avon on 22 September 2016.Top tips on writing action sequencesBy Paul FinchI’mhonoured that my crime novels have won praise from reviewers for their actionsequences. Flattering terms like ‘vivid’, ‘gut-thumping’ and ‘bone-crunching’have all been used in recent times, so I can only assume that I’m doingsomething reasonably right.It maysurprise people to hear this, but one of the tricks to writing good action isto be subtle.For real?,I hear you ask. ‘Gut-thumping’? ‘Bone-crunching’? What’s subtle about that?What I meanis that action is most effective when used sparingly. Otherwise you risk yournovel turning into a cartoon. Now, that may be what some authors are looking to achieve. Butpersonally, I like to keep things just this side of believable. So I don’tinclude a fist fight or a car chase on every other page. Likewise, I try to dothose other things that are important in novel-writing: evoke some mood, someatmosphere, develop plot and character, examine relationships, etc. And that’snot some attempt to be literary, it’s an attempt to create a more rounded andsatisfying experience for the readers, and to prevent them becoming bored,because you can just as easily get bored with too much action as you can withtoo much kissing, too much chatter, etc. Anotherproblem with overusing action is that you consistently have to raise thestakes, always needing to produce a bigger, louder sequence than the onebefore. You won’t need me to tell you that it isn’t long before this getspreposterous. You could finish up with the situation you had in the Bond movie,DIE ANOTHER DAY, which included an invisible car, a giant beam of concentratedsolar energy fired from a satellite and destroying Earth’s armies, and Bond wind-surfing a tidal wave.Even tryingto keep things grounded sometimes isn’t enough. You only need to look back atsome of the 1980s action extravaganzas, the Schwarzenegger and Stallone movie,which were often blizzards of gunfire from beginning to end, with soaringbody-counts and heroes who were completely invincible. And that’s anotherthing. Unless you’re setting out to write about superheroes, remember that themore vulnerable your lead character is going to be, the more effective he/she is.To have weaknesses is human – it’s a recognisable and even likeable trait infiction. So if youportray them walking through storms of bullets without getting hurt, or despatching every opponent withridiculous ease … why would anything else your reader sees them encounter bedeemed a threat? How will he/she empathise with them? All tension and suspenseis lost.These arethe most important tips I can offer with regard to action sequences. Don’toveruse them and don’t overcook them. Less is always more, and remember that inthe real world violence has consequences. Even if your heroes emerge from thebattle unscathed, they are not going to be unshaken. There may also be legalramifications, especially if your hero is a cop. Okay, it’s a built-in given withpolice thriller fiction that the central character tends to be on the side ofright and therefore, almost whatever he/she does will end up being approved.But I once read a very interesting quote from a senior San Francisco policeofficer, who, after it was draw to his attention that in the five Dirty Harrymovies, Callahan’s kill-count was somewhere in the 40s or 50s, commented thatno serving officer with such a record could expect to keep his job or even hisliberty.Obviously,we’re often dealing with ‘do or die’ situations in our novels, but the legalstructure of the free world is important, so we at least have to pay a degreeof lip-service towards that. All thatsaid, if you use them judiciously, your action sequences can still be among thehighlights of your book. For this reason, I myself find them the most demandingscenes to write, because they need to be bang-on.One case inpoint was a car-chase across South London in my fifth Heckenburg novel, HUNTED.It was described by one reviewer as ‘the mother of all car-chases’, which mademe happy, because though it only occupied two pages of the novel, it had takenme two whole weeks to construct it. First of all, I’d wanted to get it correctgeographically. This involved plotting it on a map and taking advice fromLondon traffic officers. I also drove the route to see if such a chase wastechnically possible. And while the actual writing might have been done in aday, it then needed to be very tightly edited. It isn’t a rule of law, but Ialways find it gives you a quicker read if you use shorter, punchier sentences.So whatever you do, don’t meander – get to the point of each sentenceimmediately. This will energise the entire passage. Also,remember that the quality of an action sequence is not just a piece ofnarrative. It works much better when it’s an assault on the senses. Any kind ofpursuit or combat situation can be overwhelming for those involved. You’ve gotto think how it looks to be in the midst of this terrible danger, how itsounds, how it smells: a chaos of flickering ‘jumping jack’ images, the mingledstenches of sweat, blood, oil, the crump of splintering metal, the explosion ofshattering glass, the deafening bangs as speeding cars rebound from oneanother, etc. All of thiscan make it a vivid experience for your audience, who I try to involve as muchas I possibly can. If you can make your reader feel that he/she is the onebeing put through the mangle, not your hero, then that is one sure way to makethem flip through those pages in a blur of speed. About Paul FinchPaul Finchis a screenwriter, novelist, short story writer and journalist, whose publishedand broadcast work covers a wide spectrum of genres, including horror, fantasy,science fiction, thrillers and crime.Find out more about Paul Finch on his website and also on Twitter - @paulfinchauthorStrangersBy Paul FinchPublished by Avon (22 September 2016)ISBN: 978-0007551316Publisher's descriptionUnknown,alone, and fearing for your life.As PC LucyClayburn is about to find out, going undercover is the most dangerous workthere is.But, on thetrail of a prolific female serial killer, there's no other option – and thesemurders are as brutal as they come.Lucy muststep into the line of fire – a stranger in a criminal underworld that butchersanyone who crosses the line.And,unknown to Lucy, she's already treading it…My verdictStrangers is original, fast-paced and terrifying at times, as PC Lucy Clayburn goes undercover to investigate a series of brutal murders. Unusually, the book features a female serial killer - not often found in crime fiction.I have enjoyed Paul Finch's Heck series so far (although I still have another book to read) and found Strangers to be equally as enjoyable and compelling, with a new female police officer in the primary role, rather than a detective. The book is dark and brutal at times, delving into the criminal underworld and prostitution. It's also highly descriptive, mixing police investigation with page-turning action and entertaining storytelling.I really liked PC Lucy Clayburn's character - and she certainly felt very real by the end of the book. I'm hoping she will feature in more Paul Finch books in the future.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour:"},

The e-book is out NOW. This is a stunning emotional psychological thriller and provides a fascinating insight into the care system too! Here's my review...The Mountain in my ShoeBy Louise BeechPublished by Orenda Books (published 30 September 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633397Publisher's descriptionOn thenight Bernadette finally has the courage to tell her domineering husband thatshe's leaving, he doesn't come home. Neither does Conor, the little boy she'sbefriended for the past five years. Also missing is his lifebook, the onlything that holds the answers. With the help of Conor's foster mum, Bernadettemust face her own past, her husband's secrets and a future she never daredimagine in order to find them all.My verdictYou know when you love a book so much that you don't want it to end - yet you are compelled to keep on reading? And you know when you find a book that you'll read again and again? Well, The Mountain in my Shoe is definitely one of those books for me.I loved Louise Beech's first book, How to be Brave - it was my favourite read of 2015. So a small part of me was worried that I wouldn't like her second book quite as much. But my fears were totally unfounded. The Mountain in my Shoe captured my heart from the outset, with its beautiful writing (yet again) and another intriguing, emotional plot.The Mountain in my Shoe is very different from How to Be Brave, proving Louise Beech's versatility as a writer. This is a gripping psychological thriller, with a missing child, missing book and missing husband at its centre. Yet this powerful novel is also about so much more than this. A sense of belonging. Knowing where you come from and where you're going to. Needing a sense of security. Being surrounded by people who care and love you, no matter what.There are two main intertwined threads, told from the point of view of Bernadette, an abused wife who is ready to leave her husband yet has nowhere to go, and by Conor, a young boy living his whole life in the care system. Conor's mother is unable to look after him, his father unknown, and he has been passed from one carer to another since birth. His fascination with boxing legend Mohammed Ali provides the backdrop to the story - and helps to give the book its name.Although not a 'character', Conor's 'Lifebook' plays a key role in the story too. The Mountain in my Shoe contains notes, letters and extracts of reports from the moment Conor was born, with contributions from social workers, carers and other key figures in his life. It provides a fascinating insight into his early experiences, the care system and all of the people who have shaped the baby into the boy he has become.Louise Beech has a talent for getting right inside the heads and hearts of all of her characters, so you believe in them, root for them and feel for them. Conor is naive and vulnerable in some ways, but wise and strong beyond his years in others. Bernadette's relationship with her controlling husband Richard, in particular, is dealt with sensitively, with his abusive tendencies and crucial events woven carefully into the plot. Every character, however minor, has an important place in this novel - the supporting cast leaves as much of an impression as the main characters themselves.This is a fascinating page turner that wrenches at your insides. It's dark, compelling and highly thought provoking and left me with tears rolling down my cheeks. The story and characters will linger on long after you've finished reading the final page.Another book that I'll be recommending to the world - repeatedly and relentlessly. I can't wait to see what Louise Beech comes up with next.I received an Advanced Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog TourNext up is ... @havebooksblog"},

And even if the home he remembers is real,how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in ajourney more wondrous and horrifying than anything he could've imagined - onethat will force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battlesa terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.My verdictIt wasn't wise to finish reading Dark Matter in the early hours of the morning. This book totally plays with your mind. I couldn't sleep afterwards, as I struggled to comprehend what I had just read - and what could possibly have happened after that final page.I'm not going to give away any of the story (as you can read the blurb above) - but Dark Matter is compelling, thought provoking and sheer brilliance. For much of the book, I couldn't breathe, I was exhausted and in a daze. This is a true rollercoaster ride of a page turner. It's hard hitting with a constant flow of action, thoughts, ideas and theories. There's plenty of physics in there - it is a science fiction thriller, after all - but Blake Crouch explains everything carefully in simple terms so that the story continues to flow.At the heart of Dark Matter is the sliding doors concept mixed with time travel. The 'what ifs' in life. And 'what would you sacrifice for love?' But with sinister, terrifying undertones and a fight for survival. There's a film in the making - and that doesn't surprise me at all.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},

But her new job ashousekeeper and gardener is not all that it seems, and her silent, surlyemployer, 44-year-old Sigurd Bagge, is not the old man she expected. As theyawait the return of his wife from her travels, their silent, uneasy encountersdevelop into a chilling, obsessive relationship, and it becomes clear thatatonement for past sins may not be enough.My verdictThe Bird Tribunal is an eerie Norwegian psychological thriller with claustrophobic unease that seeps out of every page. It's beautifully written and exceptionally translated - it's clear that every sentence has been carefully constructed as the words flow seamlessly.It's the chilling tale of Allis, a young woman who takes a job as housekeeper in an isolated house, determined to put the past behind her. Her solitary employer is a quiet moody man with a mysterious background who is waiting for his wife to return. The atmosphere between them prickles with tension, as they struggle to suppress their attraction and their stories of guilt, betrayal, love and redemption are gradually revealed.I'm not sure that I've read a book with such a small cast of characters, but this certainly adds to its claustrophobic nature. I was hooked from the first page right through to the end. The Bird Tribunal isn't just about the words on the page, but also what's between the lines, with a flood of emotions bubbling under the surface. I read most of the book in one sitting, unable to tear myself away from the powerful emotional pull of the haunting prose. I was aware of my heart pounding, actually holding my breath in places, and an unsettling tingling sensation on my skin.The story builds to a final dramatic ending that I couldn't stop thinking about afterwards. I was speechless - this book isn't one I'll forget. Yet again Orenda Books has chosen a stunner. Wow. I can easily imagine this as a television adaption - a chilling drama that leaves you breathless.

{"title": "Q&A with Sanjida Kay (by Holly Seddon)", "date": "Wednesday 28 September 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Sanjida Kay to my blog today - in a Q&A with Holly Seddon (author of Try Not to Breathe). Sanjida's book Bone By Bone was published in paperback by Corvus on 1 September 2016.Over to you Holly & Sanjida ...Q&A with Sanjida Kay by Holly SeddonHolly Seddon: I downloaded Bone by Bone shortly after it was published, andfound myself sinking back into it at every opportunity. It’s beautifullywritten, artfully plotted and will send a shiver down the spine of every adultwho has ever cared for a child. It was therefore a real pleasure to pick thebrain of author Sanjida Kay.Q. Bone by Bone hinges around recently-divorced Laura and hernine-year-old daughter Autumn. They live alone in a large house and you capturethe terror of being the only adult in the family home perfectly. Are yousomeone who gets spooked easily?Thank you! I don’t think I’m easily spooked, but I’ve always hadterrible nightmares. I realised recently that I would be very weird to play aword association game with. So if you were to say, sweet, I’d say, choke;car - crash, wood - wolf…okay I’ll stop there! Maybe I’m meant to be athriller writer!Q. Before I was a parent, I found it easier to write about devastatingthings happening to children. Now I have certain ‘limits’ that I can’t cross. How did you cope with writing the scenes involvingnine-year-old Autumn, did it effect you outside of writing time?I agree. There are things I don’t want to write about now, much lessthink about. I used to cry when I read early drafts of Bone by Bone. With mysecond thriller, The Stolen Child (out next April) I avoided some research. Itwas only once I’d finished and was pretty close to sending it to my publishers(yours too!), that I forced myself to read Kate McCann’s book about Madeleine.Q. I think even the most mild mannered pacifists have one red linewhere, if it were crossed, they could see themselves reacting with violence.And for me, as for many, it’s my children. The idea of acting to protect your children, and thatleading to dark consequences feels very real and very close to home. Are we allone rash move from disaster? Was it hard putting yourself into that situation,albeit it in your imagination?I know what you mean! I find confrontation difficult, but I know I couldbe very fierce on behalf of my daughter. Even watching kids pushing her out ofthe way on the slide in the park is tricky! Maybe it’s our generation though?Perhaps we’ve become pushy, overprotective parents in opposition to our morelaissez-faire mothers and fathers. And then that begets the moral question - howacceptable is violence if we can understand, and would maybe even react in asimilar way in the same circumstances?Q. Bone by Bone is absolutely a thriller, with suspense, twists andjumpy bits. But I thought it was also a really beautiful examination of how itfeels to be part of the sandwich: The adult daughter critiquing her own motherwhile feeling critiqued (and criticised) by her, and the single parent feelingpowerless and alone in supporting and nurturing her own daughter. Did youconsciously want to look at those grandmother/mother/daughter relationships orwas that something that just developed naturally?Oh I’m so glad you noticed that and it resonated with you too! I alwayslike to have a theme going on in my work and that was one of my mine in Bone byBone. I’m interested in the intensity of the relationship women have with theirmothers and their daughters; the idea that you are always a daughter,and once you have a child, you will never stop being a mother.I’m also fascinated by how a mother raises a child in one way, and shewill rebel - or attempt to rebel, but in doing so, will both make her ownmistakes, and turn into a version of her mother anyway. The book that had themost impact on me when I was researching Bone by Bone was, You’re Wearing That?by Deborah Tannen, in which she analyses how mothers and daughters seekapproval from each other, but misread one another - seeing care as criticism.She describes how horrible she was to her mother because her mum was a littleplump, and Deborah was skinny (even though Deborah knew her mum weighed99 pounds when she got married). Later in life, her mum poked her finger intoDeborah’s not-so-flat mid-riff and, whilst she was hurt, she felt it waspayback for her behaviour as a teenager. How amazing it would be to get out ofthis vicious cycle but I’m not sure it’s so easy.Q. You mention British Military Fitness classes in Bone by Bone a fewtimes. I’ve done these (brutal!) classes a fewtimes and they’re awesome – are you a fan?I’m a big fan of British Military Fitness and you’re right, it’s brutal!It’s actually where I met my husband! After my daughter was born, I downloadedthe BMF app and I used to go to the park and do a workout next to the buggywhile she was sleeping. I figured if anyone tried to snatch my daughter when Iwas doing my sprints, I’d sprint back faster! (Darn it, that was a nice scenein a park and I had to turn it into child abduction.)Q. I love that you have a PhD in chimpanzees. Do you still do anyacademic work in this field and are there any other ambitions you have outsideof writing?I still work as a wildlife presenter now and again, mainly forCountryfile. I like making films about British wildlife - I’m passionate aboutour countryside. I’d love to film in a jungle or up a mountain, but I don’twant to leave my family for too long. I did a shoot in Australia and that wasthe longest I’ve been away from them. It was only a week so I spent half thetime on the plane!Q. Bristol is the backdrop for the action in Bone by Bone and we see itsdark corners and its fancy bits. Was it a pleasure to showcase your city? Didyou feel any pressure to get it spot on knowing your fellow Bristolians wouldread the book?I partly set Bone by Bone where I live because my daughter was tiny whenI was writing it, so I didn’t have to go anywhere or do any research, and I wasout pounding the streets with the buggy every day anyhow! But I do loveBristol; I like the juxtaposition between urban and wild, between rich and poorand black and white in this city of mine. Although the descriptions areaccurate, the geography is not - I moved chunks around to make my plot work. Sofar no-one has complained. Maybe readers were just glad to see somewhere otherthan London in a thriller!!Q. As a writer, I’m really interested to know how you found switching from historicalfiction to thrillers? Was this an itch you always wanted to scratch?For me, it’s always about the story - as I’m sure it is with you too. Somy third novel happened to be historical. But then my publishers wanted anotherhistorical novel, when my inclination had been to go off in a differentdirection. I had the idea for Bone by Bone and then realised it was apsychological thriller. At that point I decided to do some research so I’d knowwhat I was letting myself in for! I didn’t want to be one of those novelistswho thinks writing in a genre is easy - and then makes a ton of mistakes! I’mnot saying I’ve cracked it, but I hope I’ll always push myself and keep learningthroughout my writing life.Q. Are there any other genres you’d love to try? I have to admit to harbouring dreams of writing an oldmanor house murder mystery myself!Oooh, that sounds Agatha Christie meets Barbara Vine! I’d read it! I’dlike to write science fiction (I’m a mad Margaret Atwood fan) and thrillers - Ilike the way you can get drama and big issues into a thriller, whereas withdomestic noir, the focus is almost laser-like in its intensity on the family.Thank you so much for your insightful answers, Sanjida, and I for one am relieved not to be the only person who always sees the potential darkness on even the sunniest day!About Sanjida KaySanjida Kay has a PhD on chimpanzees and has had nine bookspublished.

A Suitable Lie is out in ebook and paperback NOW and it's brilliant!! Here's my review...A Suitable LieBy Michael J MalonePublished by Orenda Books (15 September 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633496Publisher's descriptionAndy Boydthinks he is the luckiest man alive. Widowed with a young child, after his wifedies in childbirth, he is certain that he will never again experience truelove. Then he meets Anna. Feisty, fun and beautiful, she's his perfect match...And she loves his son, too. When Andy ends up in the hospital on his weddingnight, he receives his first clue that Anna is not all that she seems. Heignores it; a dangerous mistake that could cost him everything. A brave, deeplymoving psychological thriller which marks a stunning departure for one ofScotland's top crime writers.My verdictA Suitable Lie is stunning, heartbreaking, passionate and tense. A book that packs a powerful punch - in more ways than one - and left me reeling and totally drained.Writing with compassion and empathy, Michael J Malone has tackled a difficult - and often taboo - topic. His tight plot, taut writing, sharp dialogue and strong characters keep the story moving at a fast pace and provide a thought-provoking insight into a bullying relationship. He conveys the difficulties involved in leaving a marriage or taking physical action against an abusive partner, with some dark humour and lighter moments in places to ease the escalating tension. This is one hell of a rollercoaster read!The author's background as a poet shines throughout the book. His rhythmic prose flows beautifully with stunning imagery and emotion in every sentence, each scene described so vividly that it was as if I was present myself. There are a few violent scenes, but this is not without good reason, adding to the horrific nature of the relationship that lies at the heart of the plot.This is a compelling story from start to finish and certainly yet another book I'll be recommending widely. There are a few twists, turns and surprises. But most of all, A Suitable Lie is a book that will leave you on the edge of your seat and take you on an emotional journey, gripped with worry, anger, tension and relief. Orenda Books has done it again, publishing a book that you'll want to cherish and remember.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.FOLLOW THE BLOG TOUR!Tomorrow it's Crime Book Junkie - @nholten40!"},

Stuart is a former policer officer who now advises writers on police actions and procedures. You can find out more by visiting Stuart's website - http://www.gibconsultancy.co.ukFrom Helping Fight Crime to Helping Write Crimeby Stuart GibbonMy name isStuart Gibbon and I'm a former police officer who served for 30 years in Londonand the East Midlands before retiring from the police service in 2012. A largepart of my career was spent as a Detective in Major Crime. As a Detective ChiefInspector (DCI) I was in charge of Murder and other serious crimeinvestigations. As such, I have considerable experience in the way policeinvestigate crime and other police-related issues.On leavingthe police service I decided to set up my own business, GIB Consultancy www.gibconsultancy.co.uk. I now help writers by givingadvice on police actions and procedures. It can be anything from how a missing personis investigated or how forensic evidence works to how the police would go aboutsolving a Murder.Writersgenerally contact me via e-mail through my website and either send me a list ofquestions which they would like answering or send me a draft of the policeprocedural element of their work for fact-checking.Althoughmost of my work comes from crime writers, I sometimes get enquiries fromwriters of other genres who may want to include a police-related topic in theirbook. My first written acknowledgement came courtesy of Tammy Cohen, after Iprovided advice for the thriller 'Dying for Christmas'. More recently I've beenhelping C.L. Taylor with advice for 'The Missing' (released in April nd amassive hit!!) and her fourth thriller currently being written. I wasoriginally contacted by Cally back in November 2014 and continue to help as andwhen required. It's great to see the advice and information you have given toauthors actually appearing in the published version.I've helpedwriters with many different topics from the role of the Coroner in suspiciousdeaths, how the police promotion system works to forensic procedures and Courtsentencing guidelines. One of the most interesting was explaining how thepolice would deal with a person in prison who had confessed to a serious crime(you may recognise this if you've read 'The Missing', if you haven't keep aneye out for it!!!)I also talkwith Writing Groups on the subject of 'Murder investigation' and have a coupleof national conferences booked for later this year as a speaker. I take theaudience through a Murder case (using a generic case study) from discoveryof a body to the arrest and detention of a suspect, explaining thechallenges facing Detectives in such cases.   My newcareer is every bit as interesting and rewarding as my old one and it's greatto contribute towards the hard work that goes into writing a book. If anywriters need help with police procedural or investigative processes I can becontacted via my website www.gibconsultancy.co.ukwhether you just have the odd question or require more detailed advice."},

She thinks she's immune to the charms of a man like this. But maybe notthis time . . . Would you?My verdictSharon Bolton has been one of my favourite authors for years, with her talent for writing dark and twisted novels,with strong female lead characters. Daisy in Chains is certainly another fast-paced read that kept me transfixed.Daisy in Chains covers a fascinating topic - women who develop an obsession with men in prison, specifically those locked up for murder. It focuses on whether Hamish Wolfe is innocent or guilty of atrocious crimes. Hamish is charming and seductive and used to getting his own way. And once he decides that Maggie Rose is the lawyer he wants, there's no stopping him.I can't say too much about the book without giving anything away.

Marley to my blog today for his Standstill Blog Tour. John is talking about twists in crime fiction. Standstill is being published in paperback original by Avocado Books on 15 September 2016.  Served with a TwistBy J.A. MarleyAt the age of 18 I got my first job in television.  I didn’t know it would be the start of athirty-year career in TV land.  Nor did Irealise it was also the start of a convoluted apprenticeship for when I startedto write my debut novel about a huge robbery in London, Standstill.All TV programmes are basically a narrative.  It doesn’t matter if it is a quiz show, amusical performance, a news report or even a documentary. They all have definedbeginnings, middles and ends, and they all peak and trough in the same way agood story does.  Years sat in edit suites piecing footage together to createa larger whole for the likes of an episode of Through the Keyhole (yes, I produced that with Sir David Frost andLoyd Grossman) or fine cutting one of my RAF series (Britain’s Flying Past and Britain’sUltimate Pilots) for BBC2 were great proving grounds.  They taught me how to pace a story, how tolead the audience where I wanted them to go and how to satisfy them with adenouement that would meet and then exceed their expectations. One such vital lesson was taught to me by an amazingproducer, Conor McAnally.  He was afabulous character, and we collaborated on several series during mycareer.  Our most notable shows were kidsprogrammes such as Disney Club and SMTV:Live and CD:UK.  He’s a charismaticman and he used to plaster our office walls with his latest thoughts on how ourshows were doing or how they could be better. And one of those thoughts hasalways stuck with me.“Surprise and delight your audience”Now that doesn’t sound revelatory when you first read it,but when you are constructing a TV entertainment it becomes a big ask.  That audience will have expectations.  They will demand you fulfil them or with aflick of the remote they will be gone. But then when you apply it to a novel, especially a crime thriller, it’snot a big ask…it’s a huge one.Surprising and delighting a crime reader means you have tokeep them on their toes.  Lead them downa blind alley, then get them out in the most unexpected of ways.  They love genre conventions.  They will always know them better thanyou.  So you better stick with them andthen subvert them only in a manner that crime readers will approve of.  Basically…you better have a load of twists for me in herebuster, or your book goes to the charity shop!At a recent author event the excellent writer Tim Weavertalked about how writing a crime thriller means the author has to second guessthe reader second guessing the author.  Ithought that was terrific insight and on reflection it is the same message asthe one Conor used to drill into me.  In Standstill Ihave tried to end each chapter with either a mini twist or at least a momentthat will lead the reader to think “Oh, just one more chapter then…”.  The twist is all important as far I amconcerned.  The smarter the twist, themore concealed, the better set up, the more satisfying it is, and usually makesthe whole book shine out as well.  That moment in LAConfidential when Capt Dudley Smith kills Det Jack Vincennes.  Or realising that Bruce Willis is dead in The Sixth Sense.  Any version you choose of Witness for the Prosecution, stories withmoments that blindside you, take your breath away, confound yourexpectations…they are electric.   Isthere a big twist in Standstill?  You’ll have to read it to find out!So I suppose this blog post is a long winded thank you.  A thank you from me to television, andespecially to Conor McAnally.  Thelessons learnt trying to make a TV show zing have lead me down the path torealising my true ambition.  I havewritten a thriller, the first of many hopefully, and I couldn’t have done itwithout learning how to serve it up with a twist…I hope Standstill manages to surprise anddelight you…About J.A.

I would like to welcome Mark to my blog to talk about the inspiration behind his central character Sophie. Plus there's a Book Giveaway at the end of this blog post. The Devil's Work was published by Thomas & Mercer on 13 September 2016. The inspiration behind SophieBy Mark EdwardsBefore I was a full-time writer, I worked asa marketing manager for a small publisher in London. It’s where I met my wife,Sara. We worked together for several years, at one point sitting at adjacentbanks of desks. We were together 24 hours a day, talking about work when wewere at home, chatting about home when we were at work.After our first child was born, Sara went onmaternity leave. When she returned seven months later, she was promotedimmediately and became the manager of a small team. Over the coming months, Iwatched her deal with enormous stress – pressure from above and below, anenormous workload that meant she could never switch off, lots of issues withthe people she was managing. As well as that, she felt guilty about the amountof time she was spending apart from our daughter, who was in full-time nursery.And on top of all that, there was always a huge amount of psychodrama in ouroffice. Politics and gossip and power struggles. It was intense, and Saraeventually left to become a much happier freelancer.When I came up with the idea for The Devil’s Work – a psychological thrillerabout colleagues from hell, where paranoia is fully justified – I immediatelydecided I wanted the main character to be a woman. I had written from femalepoints of view before, but the protagonists in my solo books had previouslyalways been male. I was a little nervous. Could I make Sophie, the centralcharacter, convincing? I didn’t realise at first that I waswriting about the situation Sara had found herself in a few years before. Orthat Sophie was based, in some ways, on my wife. She didn’t recognise herself,though. In fact, when I showed the first draft to Sara she said that Sophie wasmore like a female version of me! It seemed that I had based Sophie on a hybridof Sara and myself. But I feel confident that I have created a convincing woman.One early reviewer told me she had to keep reminding herself that I was male –the only instance when that is a compliment.There are strong echoes of our marriage inthe relationship between Sophie and her husband, Guy, too. The way Guy tellsSophie she worries too much and she tells him he doesn’t worry enough. Hishabit of describing everything as a nightmare and her irritation at that. But there is one big difference betweenSophie and Sara and me. Sophie has a dark secret in her past, something thatcomes back to wreck her life, and neither Sara nor I do.At least, I don’t think Sara has a darksecret…About Mark EdwardsMark Edwards writes psychological thrillers.His first solo novel, The Magpies (2013), reached the No.1 spot on Amazon UK and has sold 300,000 copies to date.This was followed by What You Wish For (2014), Because She Loves Me (2014) and Follow You Home (2015). He also co-writes with Louise Voss,including a series featuring Detective Inspector Patrick Lennon, starting with From the Cradle (2014) and The Blissfully Dead (2015). Mark grew up on the south coast of Englandand starting writing in his twenties while working in a number of dead-endjobs.

Soon after, a pack of Clare's blood is left on a doorstep in theheart of the City of London.Alice Quentin is brought in to help thetraumatised child uncover his memories - which might lead them to his mother'scaptors. But she swiftly realises Clare is not the first victim... nor will shebe the last.The killers are driven by a desire forrevenge... and in the end, it will all come down to blood.My verdictKate Rhodes' Alice Quentin series gets better and better. And reading Blood Symmetry felt like coming back to an old friend, comforting and familiar, as I've read most of this series - the only one I haven't read is the very first book, simply because I discovered this series at a later date.Blood Symmetry is intriguing and fascinating. It's based on fact - the author's own family experiences - and this certainly shows in the compassionate writing, as well as the well-researched background to the plot. As I've written in reviews about this series in the past, I love the familiar London setting too.The plot is dark and chilled me to the bone. What seemed initially to be a one-off kidnapping turned out to be one of a series of abductions and killings, all linked by blood and revenge. As a health journalist, I love medical thrillers, and this certainly was a brilliant page turner. I couldn't put it down!I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},

But now they're in your home, and whoknows what they'll find there.What would yoube capable of, when pushed past your limit?My verdictThe Couple Next Door is another missing child book, but takes a slightly different stance.A couple leave their baby daughter at home one evening while they go to a party next door, popping back to their house to check up on her every hour or so. They return home to discover their baby has been snatched from her cot and there's no sign of any intruders.This is certainly an easy read and would be great for holidays by the beach or pool. There are various twists and turns and, on the whole, the book is well written and well plotted. It's filled with a whole host of unreliable characters, none are whom are particularly likeable. In fact, most of them are quite nasty and manipulative and couldn't be trusted. Suspicion crept through every page, as the detective in charge of the investigation attempted to established whether this crime had been planned in advance - and, if so, by whom.The Couple Next Door is certainly a page turner and a fast paced read. But I have to admit that after a while I wasn't that worried about what had happened to the baby. I had already guessed some of the plot anyway. I was intrigued though to see which way the plot was heading, as each character wove a complex web of lies to cover up their secrets and dark past.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

How wrong I was. Shona is struggling to cope in her new isolated home and with a young baby, while her husband is working offshore. So it's a relief when she meets the intriguing and flamboyant Valentina, who provides friendship and companionship at this difficult time.

Secrets and lies ooze through every page, with so many twists and turns that the ending left me breathless.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Expanding the Golden Age by Ragnar Jónasson", "date": "Tuesday 6 September 2016", "text": "I am delighted to welcome Ragnar Jónasson to my blog today for his Blackout Blog Tour. Ragnar talks about the Golden Age of detective fiction and which titles he has enjoyed the most. Blackout was published in paperback by Orenda Books on 15 July 2016. You can read a snippet of my review below.Expanding the Golden AgeBy Ragnar JónassonI havesometimes been asked about my influences and in these cases I invariablymention the Golden Age of detecive fiction, along with more modern crimeauthors as well, of course. The Golden Age is usually defined as the erabetween the two world wars, and I thought I might use this opportunity torecommend a few Golden Age titles which I’ve enjoyed. These books are usuallyfocused on the detection of a crime, although they can hardly be called policeprocedurals, and the element of the puzzle is quite important. Fair play isalso of the utmost improtance and the reader is challenged to solve the case –indeed sometimes literally, as in the first book I’d like to mention, “TheRoman Hat Mystery”, Ellery Queen’s first case, first published in 1929. The earlyEllery Queen novels are superb examples of the Golden Age, and a particularfavorite of mine, in addition to The Roman Hat Mystery, is The Dutch ShoeMystery (1931), which is perfectly set in a mysterious hospital. Another greatGolden Age writer from the US, if somewhat underrated perhaps, is S.S. VanDine, the creator of the debonaire sleuth Philo Vance. My favorite is TheGreene Murder Case (1928), set in the “gloomy Greene mansion in New York”, butI can also recommend, for example, The Scarab Murder Case (1929). I would alsolike to mention a classic novel by Anthony Berkely, The Poisoned ChocolatesCase (1929), featuring Roger Sheringham, and it should be noted that theBritish Library will be re-issuing this title in October, with a brand newalternative ending by crime writer Martin Edwards. Another great Golden Ageauthor is New Zealand’s Ngaio Marsh, and amongst her titles I would recommend“Enter a Murderer” (1935), the second Roderick Alleyn mystery, dealing with amurder in the theatre. I have of course failed to mention the Golden Agewriter here above, Agatha Christie, as selecting my favorite of her novelswould be the subject for another article.About Ragnar JónassonRagnar Jónassenwas born in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he works as a writer and a lawyer. Healso teaches copyright law at Reykjavik University and has previously worked onradio and television, including as a TV-news reporter for the IcelandicNational Broadcasting Service.

As the 24-hour light of the arctic summer is transformed into darkness by an ash cloud from a recent volcanic eruption, a young reporter leaves Reykajvik to investigate on her own, unaware that an innocent person's life hangs in the balance. Ari Thor Arason and his colleagues on the tiny police force in Siglufjordur struggle with an increasingly perplexing case, while their own serious personal problems push them to the limit. What secrets does the dead man harbour, and what is the young reporter hiding? As silent, unspoken horrors from the past threaten them all, and the darkness deepens, it’s a race against time to find the killer before someone else dies...My verdictBlackout is Ragnar Jónassen's darkest book yet... All of the Dark Iceland novels read like old-fashioned whodunnits set in modern times. But they're certainly NOT formulaic, as each book has given me a completely different reading experience... As the jigsaw pieces slotted into place, there were several breath-holding final chapters.Read my full review of Blackout hereCheck out more brilliant books from Orenda Books here."},

{"title": "A Death in the Family by Michael Stanley - Blog Tour", "date": "Friday 2 September 2016", "text": "Today it's my stop on the blog tour for A Death in the Family by Michael Stanley. A Death in the Family is the second Detective Kubu novel published by Orenda Books.A Death in the FamilyBy Michael StanleyPublished by Orenda Books (15 July 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633229Publisher's descriptionFaced withthe violent death of his own father, even Assistant Superintendent David 'Kubu'Bengu, Botswana's keenest mind, is baffled. Who would kill such a frail oldman? Set amidst the dark beauty of modern Botswana, A Death in the Family is athrilling insight into a world of riots, corruption and greed, as a complexseries of murders present the opera-loving, wine connoisseur detective with hismost challenging case yet.My verdictMore sunshine noir from the Michael Stanley duo. Yet again, this book combines an intriguing murder mystery with the stunning yet dark setting of Botswana. Although A Death in the Family is the fifth Detective Kubu book, it could easily be read as a standalone.A Death in the Family is certainly a modern detective novel, with its in-depth insight into Botswana corruption, greed and technology. Yet it's also timeless, with the older generation clinging to their traditions and fierce national pride.  The Michael Stanley duo write vividly and poetically. Botswana is portrayed in all its glory, with its sights, sounds and aromas, creating a stunning setting.This time Kubu is investigating (although only unofficially) a crime that's very close to his heart when his beloved father is found murdered. Normally a gentle giant, Kubu struggles to keep his emotions, frustrations and anger in check, especially as he is being kept in the dark about the ongoing investigations.To ensure he stays out of the way, Kubu is sent to investigate the death of a government official and riots in a local mining town. He gradually uncovers a tangled web of corruption in high places, linked to a local mining project, Chinese businessmen and the US embassy. Yet he still can't keep away from the investigation into his father's death.A Death in the Family is as much about Kubu's anger, grief and love for his family as it is about the crimes and investigations. Unlike many other fictional detectives, Kubu comes from a loving stable family, one that I, as a reader, feel very much part of. The rest of the characters are also well developed and realistic, bringing the entertaining yet emotional plot to life.I love these Detective Kubu novels. They're compelling and warming -  an intelligent combination of crime and thriller covering serious and fascinating issues.  Ideal for fans of Alexander McCall Smith's No 1 Ladies' Detective agency and the Death in Paradise TV series (& books).I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "The Constant Soldier by William Ryan", "date": "Wednesday 31 August 2016", "text": "The Constant SoldierBy William RyanPublished by Mantle (25 August 2016)ISBN:  978-1447255017Publisher's descriptionThe painwoke him up. He was grateful for it. The train had stopped and somewhere, upabove them, the drone of aircraft engines filled the night sky. He could almostremember her smile . . . It must be the morphine . . . He had managed not tothink about her for months now.1944. PaulBrandt, a soldier in the German army, returns wounded and ashamed from thebloody chaos of the Eastern front to find his village home much changed andexisting in the dark shadow of an SS rest hut - a luxurious retreat for thosewho manage the concentration camps, run with the help of a small group offemale prisoners who - against all odds - have so far survived the war.When, bychance, Brandt glimpses one of these prisoners, he realizes that he must find away to access the hut. For inside is the woman to whom his fate has been tiedsince their arrest five years before, and now he must do all he can to protecther.But as theRussian offensive moves ever closer, the days of this rest hut and its SS inhabitantsare numbered. And while hope - for Brandt and the female prisoners - growstantalizingly close, the danger too is now greater than ever.And, in aforest to the east, a young female Soviet tank driver awaits her orders toadvance . . .My verdictThe Constant Soldier is an emotional novel about the uncertainty of war, the loss of humanity, guilt and redemption. It offers a far more humane side to German soldiers compared with other books that cover a similar theme, including many of those that I have read in the past.Set in the last few weeks of the Nazi regimen, it follows the story of a German soldier who has returned to his home village to live with his father after suffering severe injuries. He wasn't a Nazi sympathiser, quite the opposite, but gets a job in a local SS rest hut after he recognises one of the female prisoners there.The book provides an insight into the chaos, panic and conflict felt by the Germans as the war was ending, and also the experience of the Russians as they advanced towards the camps. Some of the SS officers looked back at their actions with disgust, others with pride. Then there were the Germans who refused to take part in the brutality and joined the resistance, determined to save as many lives as possible.Based on true events, and inspired by a series of photographs of Nazi officers enjoying themselves at a rest hut, The Constant Soldier is certainly compelling and fascinating reading. It's beautifully written in haunting poetic prose, with vivid descriptions of the characters and setting. The story is gripping, realistic and well-plotted from beginning to end. I felt real empathy for many of the characters and was on the edge of my seat for much of the book and then in tears by the end.The Constant Soldier is yet another novel that I'll be recommending widely (and already have been). It's powerful, heartbreaking and highly thought-provoking - a book that shouldn't be missed.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "An interview with journalist and author Christine Webber by Christine Webber", "date": "Monday 22 August 2016", "text": "I would like to welcome Christine Webber to my blog today. Christine's book Who'd Have Thought It was published on 19 June 2016. Christine is a journalist too, so for something a bit different she's interviewed herself!An interview with myself By Christine WebberHello, everyone. I’m delighted that Victoria has given me thechance to ‘chat’ to you in this way. As I’m a journalist by trade, I thought itmight be interesting to ask myself the sort of questions I might pose if I wereinterviewing another author. So, here we go!This is your first novel for 29 years. What happened tothe first one? Was it such a flop that you crawled away vowing never to repeatthe experience? In Honour Bound waspublished when I was a news presenter for Anglia TV.  It actually did quite well – but mostly inthe nine counties of the Anglia region!What happened to prevent Novel Number 2 was complicated. Mostly,it was down to me leaving daily television news for print journalism, where Ibecame an agony aunt for various newspapers and magazines including (atdifferent times) The Scotsman, Best, TVTimes and BBC Parenting. Gaininga reputation as an agony aunt led to me being booked as a sex/relationships ‘expert’on various TV programmes - including BBCBreakfast and Good Sex Guide… Late .  Next, I decided to gain more credibilityby training as a psychotherapist. That led to me starting a small therapypractice. Soon, publishers began asking me to write self-help books. 12 ofthose later, I finally found the time to return to fiction. Many writers talk about having a burning desire to write.It doesn’t sound as if that is the case with you. Surely if you had, you wouldhave got on with this sooner? Good point! I’m interested in lots of things, I suppose. Idid keep scribbling away at novels, though. But somehow they never saw thelight of day. Were they awful?Probably. I think one thing I’ve come to understand is thatto write good fiction you need to read novels. I had read voraciously as achild, but my grown up life seemed to be all about keeping up with therapyjournals and all the newspapers – so that I was well-informed enough to do myday job.  That has changed. I now read massesof fiction. Favourite authors include Helen Dunmore, Ian McEwan, Iris Murdoch,Colm Toibin, Patirick Gale, Kate Atkinson and John le Carré.  Also, last year saw a debut novel by ClareMackintosh called I Let You Go. It wasmy favourite book of 2015 and I can’t wait to read her new one which is outshortly. I also read books by fellow indie authors and am currently loving An Unknown Woman by Jane Davis.      So, you read more fiction these days, but were thereother reasons for writing a novel now? In a nutshell, I became increasingly aware that life doesn’tgo on forever! Also, I got a great idea, which arose in a slightly strange way.I was invited on to BBC Breakfast to discussa new trend - which had been given the acronym SWOFTY by the Department forWork and Pensions. SWOFTY stood for Single Women Over Fifty. I couldn’t helpfeeling there was a novel waiting to be written here!  Also, at that time, Piatkus had just publishedmy baby boomers’ guide, Too Young to GetOld. And all the research I had done for that fed into the novel too.What’s the novelabout then? It’s about a woman GP, aged 55, who finds herselfunexpectedly single after almost 30 years of marriage. But the story starts ayear after the event when she discovers what a SWOFTY is and that she is one! And she starts embracing singlelife with enthusiasm. However, she quickly discovers that being single inmid-life is totally different from being single when you’re young – becauseyou’re dealing with your adult children’s problems, your ageing parents, yourjob, your friends having their own ups and downs and so on. Most mid-lifepeople I know say that they are amazed at how turbulent their lives are – justat a time when they thought they would be calming down. So that is reflected inthe story. There are very serious issues in it. But it’s also funny – and lotsof people have told me they have laughed out loud as they have read it, whichis gratifying. Did you publish it independently because you couldn’tfind a publisher?   There was an element of that. All my contacts in publishingwere on the non-fiction side, and there was little reason for them to beinterested in whether or not I could write a decent novel. Also, variousfriends who had always been published in the past were changing to Indie publishing.So they were an inspiration. And I came to the conclusion that I didn’t want towaste time pursuing various publishers, and that I just needed to get the bookout. I have loved the process – especially finding the right editor/proofreader (Helen Baggott) and the perfect jacket designer (Jane Dixon-Smith). Formingyour own creative team is fun! Also, I have fallen on my feet with my printers,Clays, who produce really beautiful books. Are you going to continue writing novels – and publishingthem independently? That’s the plan. About Christine WebberChristine Webber is a writer, broadcaster and psychotherapist. She has just brought out a novel – Who’d Have Thought It? After almost three decades as an author, this particular book signals a change of direction. For a start, it is her first work of fiction for 29 years!

I may still publish a couple of reviews too, but I won't be writing anything new for my blog until September.I have a huge To Be Read pile. So I have decided to concentrate on reading books that I've bought during these two weeks, rather than review copies. Top of my list are the first three Maeve Kerrigan books by Jane Casey, which have been waiting patiently on my Kindle for months. I reviewed book 5 and loved it and have been desperate to catch up with the whole series. I'll let you know exactly which other books I picked on my return.I'll also be continuing to spend my time writing and editing the manuscript of my debut novel. Due to family commitments, I took four months off writing, so it was great to get back to it at the end of July. I've been doing a big edit, following some positive and motivating feedback, and hope it will be ready to resubmit in the Autumn.Lastly, there are some fantastic London-based events coming up if you're a crime fiction fan.First Monday Crime takes place on the first Monday of every month (unless it's a bank holiday).

Everyone is asuspect.Desperate mother Jess, whose grief isdriving her to extreme measures.Newcomer Jared, with an easy charm and astring of broken hearts in his wake.Photographer Jerry, who's determined tobreak away from his controlling mother once and for all.And, investigating them all, a police chiefwith a hidden obsession of his own . . .My verdictTall Oaks isn't a crime novel, as such, although a boy's disappearance is at the heart of the book. It's far more than 'who' or 'how' or 'why'. It's a study of small town America, where nothing much usually happens, until a little boy goes missing.As mentioned by other reviewers, Tall Oaks is ideal for fans of Twin Peaks. It reads like a series of intertwined short stories featuring a whole host of diverse, larger than life characters.  It's a dark, intriguing and humorous mystery, with vivid descriptions, sharp dialogue and a gripping plot.This isn't a fast paced read, but it's certainly not a boring one! Everyone is a suspect but, without any clues, local police chief has no idea what's happened to three-year-old Harry. Everyone is also VERY keen to help him - many are over-keen - and it's clear that there are secrets, lies and strange behaviour bubbling underneath each characters' many layers. There were several twists and turns, including a few OMG moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. But it's really everything going on in the background, how easily you get caught up in people's lives and the reading between the lines that makes this a book to remember.Before I end my review, I have to mention that 'Manny rocks' - he's definitely my favourite character in Tall Oaks!"},

Onthe strength of one desperate telephone call...'Having left Texarkana for the safety of theWest Coast, reporter Charlie Yates finds himself drawn back to the South, toHot Springs, Arkansas, as an old acquaintance asks for his help. This time it'sless of a story Charlie's chasing, more of a desperate attempt to do the rightthing before it's too late.My verdictI enjoyed Black Night Falling even more than the author's first book, The Dark Inside, something I didn't think was possible. Author Rod Reynolds has written another stunner!Black Night Falling is set soon after The Dark Inside ends. Yet again, it has an authentic feel - not just for small town America but also for the 1940s time period. The book is well researched, well written and highly atmospheric, with plenty of action, historical depth and twists and turns to keep the reader engrossed and guessing all the way through.The plot is gritty, dark and intense, as reporter Charlie Yates investigates corruption, dodgy dealings and mysterious deaths in a claustrophobic town in Arkansas. Some of the characters will be familiar if you've read the first book, but I do believe Black Night Falling could be read easily as a standalone.This is a book that you won't want to put down. I was so immersed in the plot that I didn't even notice the time and finished it in the early hours. It's a winning formula of intriguing plot, believable characters and fascinating setting.Charlie is a particularly strong character and extremely likeable - he's flawed, but not unbelievably so, which makes the book feel very 'real'. His wife Lizzie seems like his perfect partner (professionally and romantically), and I'm hoping she'll be taking a more prominent role as this series continues and develops.Add Black Night Falling to your shopping list!

It also has elements of an investigation, a mystery to solve and an insight into maritime laws.Adam Dunne's girlfriend goes missing, failing to arrive back from a business trip abroad. When her passport arrives in the post with an intriguing note, it's clear that all isn't as it seems. Adam's search for Sarah leads to a cruise ship called Celebrate and to the disappearance of another woman exactly a year earlier.Distress Signals is a very twisty tale, with many layers and threads, and kept me guessing all the way through. The cruise ship setting provided an interesting slant to the missing person plot.

It’s right in the centre of the city and about amile from my home. I’d say it was both the strangest and most interesting placeI visited while researching The Madam. It’s where I had conversations with twosex workers about what life is like as a prostitute. This helped me to createthe character of Lizzie Wells, who features in the book. The story is about hersearch for revenge after she serves time in prison for a crime she didn’tcommit.Meeting these women was a strange and illuminatingexperience. So too was exploring for the first time what is unquestionably themost run-down part of the city. Not so long ago the prostitutes displayedthemselves in the windows of some of the houses. These days they’re more subtleand most, like Lizzie, work for escort agencies and service their clients intheir homes or local hotels.Your next book, The Alibi (out in January 2017), is set inPeckham. Why the change in setting? And will it be in the same genre?My next book, The Alibi, is indeed another crime novel andfeatures a young female crime reporter who investigates the brutal murder of asoap actress. The story takes place in South London, including Peckham. I feltit was the perfect setting for a thriller about ruthless gangsters and crookedcops. And since I spent my childhood living in that part of London I know itpretty well. This helped when it came to pulling together the geographicalelements of the story.You’ve covered many disturbing themes in The Madam. Isanything off limits? Does anything make you uncomfortable? Is there anyparticular topic that you wouldn’t write about?To be honest there aren’t any themes that I’d ever beinclined to shy away from. These days people are used to reading about the mosthorrendous types of crime. I get most of my ideas from newspapers and every daythey feature stories that make your hair stand on end – from awful murders tothe most revolting forms of behaviour. A lot of things make me uncomfortable –but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t write about them.Do you think your journalist background has helped with yournovel writing?I was a journalist for many years before becoming afull-time writer. Many of the stories I covered involved crime and I attendedhundreds of trials, inquests and police press conferences. I draw on thoseexperiences every time I start to develop the plot for a book.What can you tell us about your pathway to publication?I’m lucky enough to have an agent who works tirelessly on mybehalf. When I sent her the first draft of The Madam she suggested I make somechanges before submitting it to a publisher. I produced a second draft but thefirst publisher who received the manuscript rejected it. My agent then sent itto Avon/Harper Collins and they loved it and offered me a two-book deal.Looking back to your teenage years, what advice would yougive your younger self?My advice would be not to take life so seriously. Like allteens I worried too much about the future when I should have been focused onenjoying the present.If you were writing a book about your own life, what wouldthe title be?‘I DID IT MY WAY.’What advice do you have for aspiring authors?Read, read and read. And then keep on writing until you knowyou’re as good as at least most of the authors who get their books published.Then wait for that lucky break.And lastly, why should people read The Madam?I like to think that The Madam is a book that can be enjoyedon more than one level. It’s both an endearing thriller and a gritty lovestory. And at its heart is a character who I hope readers will remember long afterwards.About Jaime RavenJaime Raven is a former journalist living in Southampton.Find out more about Jaime Raven by following Avon Books on Twitter - @AvonBooksUKThe MadamBy Jaime RavenPublished by Avon (19 May 2016)ISBN: 978-0008171469Publisher's descriptionThree years and eleven months.

LisaDale shuts her eyes and counts to one hundred during a game of hide-and-seek.When she opens them, her four-year-old daughter Ella is gone. Disappearedwithout a trace. The police, the media and Lisa's family all think they knowwho snatched Ella. But what if the person who took her isn't a stranger?What if they are convinced they are doing the right thing? And what if Lisa'slittle girl is in danger of disappearing forever?My verdictWhen My Eyes Were Closed is another missing child book, keeping up with the current psychological thriller trend. But this focuses on the event through different characters' viewpoints, including that of the abductor. And this certainly provides a more intriguing approach than many of the other books out there.It's every parent's nightmare - you take your eyes off your child for a few minutes and they vanish. This is what happens to Lisa Dale when she plays hide-and-seek in the park with her four year old daughter. But the person who has taken her daughter has their own reasons for doing so - or so they think.When My Eyes Were Closed is well plotted and does have some good twists and turns. There are many different themes running through the book - it's not just a case of who has the missing child and how her family are going to get her back. You actually know who has the child from early on. This is a character-driven novel, rather than a fast-paced thriller, looking at the story behind the abductor and the devastating impact of grief.It's an interesting read and a book that I would recommend for psychological thriller fans who want something a little bit different to the mainstream.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

When she wasfifteen, she was attacked and left for dead in a park. Her attacker was neverfound. Since then, she has drifted in a lonely, timeless place. She's as goodas dead, but not even her doctors are sure how much she understands. Alex andAmy grew up in the same suburbs, played the same music, flirted with the sameboys. And as Alex begins to investigate the attack, she opens the door to thesame danger that has left Amy in a coma...My verdictTry Not to Breathe is yet another book that I devoured in just a few sittings. It's an intense, beautifully written psychological thriller. It's very different from the usual trends of missing children/teenagers or unreliable narrators. It was like a breath of fresh air. It's so cleverly plotted.Alex is a freelance journalist whose life is governed by alcohol. Due to her addiction, her marriage has crumbled, her ex-husband is now with another woman and she's lost her job. She's given a commission to write an article about a doctor who is working with coma patients - this is her chance to get her life back on track. When Alex visits the ward, she becomes intrigued by the story of Amy, a young woman who was left for dead following a brutal attack 15 years earlier. Amy's attacker has never been found. Alex is determined to discover Amy's story by delving into her past.I was particularly intrigued by the medical background, and the author has clearly done her research into coma patients. In Try Not to Breathe, patients lying in a persistent vegetative state don't appear to interact with the outside world, but some doctors believe that some of them are still able to communicate - it's a case of discovering how.Try Not to Breathe is a fantastic debut novel that keeps the reader guessing.

Flynn's book Under the Harrow was published in e-book by W&N (Orion) on 14 June 2016.Unreliable narrators: RebeccaBy Flynn BerryMy novel, Under the Harrow, isabout a woman, Nora, investigating her sister’s murder. As the police inquiryunravels, Nora becomes obsessive and reckless. Some of my favorite books haveunreliable narrators, who are duplicitous, volatile, and thrilling.  The unnamed narrator in Rebeccaby Daphne du Maurier seems complicit in the mystery at the center of thebook—the death of the first wife. Rebecca drowned in a sailing accident; herhusband identified the body; he remarried. After the wedding, our narratormoves to Manderley, a Cornish estate. Rebecca is still everywhere in the house:her favorite flowers fill the rooms, and her stationery is still in the desk.Her bedroom has been left intact: “Those were her brushes on thedressing-table, that was her dressing gown and slippers laid out upon thechair.”     What electrifies the book is the narrator’spathological jealousy of the absent first wife. Her fascination with Rebecca,and the sailing accident that caused her death, seems somehow guilty. “It mustbe cold sailing out there in the bay,” she thinks, “beyond the beacon away onthe headland.” About Flynn BerryFlynn Berry is a graduate of the Michener Center and hasbeen awarded a Yaddo residency.  Shegraduated from Brown University.  Under the Harrow is her first novel.Under the Harrowby Flynn BerryPublished by W&N (e-book - 14 June 2016)Publisher's descriptionWhen Nora takes the train from London tovisit her sister in the countryside, she expects to find her waiting at thestation, or at home cooking dinner.

Haunted bythe murder and the secrets that surround it, Nora is under the harrow:distressed and in danger. As Nora's fear turns to obsession, she becomes asunrecognizable as the sister her investigation uncovers.My verdictUnder the Harrow is a highly atmospheric psychological thriller.When Nora discovers her sister has been brutally murdered, she becomes overwhelmed with grief and distress. She doesn't trust the police, after she was assaulted as a teenager and her attacker was never found. And she can't stop thinking about her sister's death and all of the possible suspects. Could her sister's murder be related to her own traumatic experience 15 years earlier? As Nora's own investigations become an obsession, could they be leading her into danger?Beginning just before Nora discovers her sister's body, the book filled with emotion and intrigue. Nora is a completely unreliable narrator - traumatised, paranoid and grieving, with hazy memories of her own past. She seems soulless, as if her attacker robbed her of her personality and individuality, turning her into just an empty husk.Under the Harrow is more than just a murder mystery, as it explores the complex relationship between two sisters and the secrets they shared and withheld. Both sisters had moved away from their home town and moved on with their lives, although they still kept in touch. The author gets right into Nora's head - her thoughts, feelings and emotions. But since you only get to know Nora's version of events, and her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic and irrational, it seems that she may not be remembering the whole truth.The book kept me guessing all the way through. I had a whole list of suspects in my head, Nora being one of them. Was she involved?

I sit on the bench belowthe library window and watch. They’re all going up to the rec later to getdrunk – I’d heard them talking about it in the loos. They hadn’t asked me, butI don’t really mind because Mum always worries if I’m back late. I see NicolaGates over by the water fountain, but she turns away when I wave.And that’s when I first see Edie. Walkingacross the forecourt in the direction of the main doors. As I watch, her faceappearing then disappearing behind others in the crowd, she stops, her eyessquinting up at the building before darting around herself again and thenfinally landing upon me. I hold my breath. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyoneso pretty before, not in real life.Then thereshe is, standing right in front of me, and at first I’m too distracted by allthe different parts of her to take in what she’s saying: the smell of theleather jacket she’s carrying over her arm, mixed with something else,something soft and appley, her eyes, big and golden brown with lots of blackeyeliner, pale mauve varnish on her nails. In the hollow of her clavicle is alittle gold locket with a tiny green stone in the middle. If you were to putyour finger beneath it you’d feel the jump jump jump of her pulse.‘Sorry,’ I say. ‘What?’She smiles. ‘The office. Where is it?’ Hervoice is clear and sure with a northern accent – Manchester maybe.Of all the people she could have stopped toask, she’d picked me. I get to my feet. ‘I’m going that way myself,’ I tellher, though I wasn’t. ‘I’ll walk with you if you like.’She nods, shrugs. ‘Yeah, OK. Ta.’As we walk, I see Sheridan Alsop and Amy Carterstanding by the water fountain. They stop talking and watch us as we pass. Ihave a mad impulse to link my arm through hers, this stranger who walks besideme, and I imagine us strolling along like that, arm in arm like best friends.How amazed Amy and Sheridan would be to see that! I don’t though, of course.People don’t like it when you do that sort of thing, I’ve real­ized.‘My name’s Heather,’ I tell her instead.‘I’m Edie. Well, Edith really. But how lame’sthat?’ She looks around herself then shakes her head, ‘Bloody hell, thisplace.’‘Yeah,’ I say. ‘I know! Totally lame, isn’t it?Are you going to come to school here then?’She nods. ‘Starting my A-levels in September.’‘I’m doing my A-levels here too! What’re youstudying? I’m taking Biology and Maths and Chemistry. I was going to do alanguage as well but Mum and Dad said it was pointless because it’s not what Ineed to read Medicine at uni. Best to concentrate on just the three. What withall my volunteering work and everything too. I’m going to be a doctor one dayand—’ I stop myself, my mouth snapping shut. I always talk too much Mum says. Ibite my lip, waiting for Edie to look at me the way the other girls do.But she doesn’t, she only smiles again. Her longbrown hair swings in front of her face and she pushes it away, tucking itbehind her ear. ‘I’m doing Art,’ she tells me. ‘And photography. I’m going togo to art college in London. Saint Martins prob­ably,’ she adds with breezycertainty. And she explains that she’s recently moved down here to Fremton fromManchester with her mum. She has this way of talking, like she’s a bit bored byeverything, looking around herself like she finds it all a bit of a joke, butall the while glancing back at me, including me as if I’m in on the joke too.It’s nice. I could stare at her for hours.We’ve already reached the office, even thoughI’d taken her the long way round. ‘It’s in here,’ I say, and I’m about to tellher that I’ll wait for her, that I’ll show her around after if she wants, butshe’s already moving away. ‘OK. Thanks, yeah?’ she says. ‘See you later.’The door swings shut behind her. Edie. Eedee.I turn the word over and over in my mind on the walk home, trying it out forsize, tucking it away for safekeeping like it’s a precious locket on a finegold chain.Watching EdieBy Camilla WayPublished by Harper Collins (28 July 2016)ISBN: 978-0008159016Publisher's descriptionTHERE ARESOME FRIENDS YOU’LL NEVER FORGET…NO MATTERHOW HARD YOU TRYBEFOREEdie is thefriend that Heather has always craved.

I read it in one sitting - every time I put it down, I felt compelled to pick it up again.It's a totally bewitching book about friendship, lies and secrets. Two teenagers, Edie and Heather, become best friends, yet they couldn't be more different. They meet again 16 years later, when Edie is about to become a single mother, and Heather manages to worm her way back into Edie's life. The story is written from both of their points of view, but cleverly Edie's in the present and Heather's in the past. So although you're reading the two sides of their story, you're not getting the full story from either of them - in the past or the present.The writing is chilling, disturbing and unsettling. I knew there was something in the dark background of the characters - I just couldn't work out what it was.The publisher asked readers to tweet one word about their thoughts at the end. Well, my one word was 'stunned'. But actually I also felt sick and was horrified and actually angry. I love a book that brings out so many emotions. This is certainly a book I won't forget in a hurry - if at all.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Read an extract of the book here."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Elizabeth Haynes - Blog Tour", "date": "Tuesday 26 July 2016", "text": "I am delighted that ELIZABETH HAYNES is my Author in the Spotlight today for her Blog Tour. Never Alone is being published by Myriad Editions in e-book on 28 July 2016. Your latest novel NeverAlone is a psychological thriller and a return to your ‘writing roots’. Youbegan in this genre, with Into theDarkest Corner, Revenge of the Tideand Human Remains, before embarkingon your police procedural series featuring DI Louisa Smith. Why the move backto the psychological thriller genre? And why now?I haven't abandoned Louisa completely! I wrote the firstdraft of the next series book in November, so I have the Briarstone team in aholding pattern waiting for their latest case to be revealed.Never Alone is oneof those books that demanded to be written, and I need to vary what I'm writingin order to keep things fresh. The plot is linear which makes a change afterthe last few books – all the tension is in the setting, the characters, and theweather. It feels claustrophobic as a result, which I found thrilling to write.Never Alone isdescribed as a ‘gripping thriller that crosses the line between erotica andcrime fiction’. How much more ‘sexually graphic’ is this latest novel than yourprevious ones?I don't think it's more graphic than my other books. Let'sface it, I've written about someone being turned on by decomposition beforenow; that was pretty grim. I like to think that the sex scenes in Never Aloneare less traumatic and perhaps more erotic and sensual than in my previousbooks. I like writing strong women who are confident about making choices, evenwhen others find those choices difficult to accept. For me, arousal happens inthe mind before it becomes a physical response, and let's just say that sexualfulfilment is a subject that one of my characters specialises in… So – it's notmore graphic, but there is certainly plenty of it! Brace yourselves.You’ve covered many dark, chilling and disturbing themes inyour books so far. Is anything off limits? Does anything make youuncomfortable? Is there any particular topic that you wouldn’t write about?I find it very difficult to write about cruelty towardsvulnerable people, and animals. I struggle to read books with this as a theme –and bullying, for instance – so I avoid writing them too.  It might seem strange that I can write aboutviolence and murder which, of course, is the ultimate cruelty; but there is adefinite line that I can't bring myself to cross. Perhaps it's too close tohome?What’s the most interesting place that you have visited whenresearching one of your novels? And what’s the strangest?I am slightly sidestepping the question here, but, like manypeople, I spend a shocking amount of time procrastinating on property websites.A couple of years ago we were considering moving house, and I began joyouslyand legitimately researching properties around the UK.One of these properties was a farmhouse in North Yorkshire.It had an open-sided barn, and an outbuilding that had once been a piggery,then a workshop, and had potential to be a single-storey annexe 'ideal for adependent relative, or as a holiday let'. The house was hunkered down near thesummit of a hill, with no near neighbours, and nothing but a few stunted treesto protect it from the wind tearing up the valley.I found myself wondering what it must be like to live upthere all alone in the winter when the snow was falling, and from there it was ashort step to imagine Sarah Carpenter, and that someone might be out there inthe snow, watching.I have to say writing NeverAlone put me right off big hills; we ended up moving to Norfolk instead.(The house in Yorkshire sold before we had a chance to put ours on the market;perhaps that was for the best.)You’re a champion of NaNoWriMo (National Novel WritingMonth) and have participated for the last 10 years. How do you believeNaNoWriMo benefits you, as an established author rather than an aspiring one?I still take part in NaNoWriMo every year and I find it verydifficult to write at any other time of the year. I'm not sure if it's thedeadline, or the exhilaration of writing alongside hundreds of thousands ofothers, or that it's just terrific fun; there is something magical and joyousabout the process. It's not easy, there are invariably moments of doubt andpanic, but you have to push through these and it's always worth it in the end.The weight of expectation that comes with being a publishednovelist is a bit overwhelming at times. The only way I can get over it is topretend that nobody's going to read my story; that I'm writing it for my ownentertainment, to unravel the mystery and uncover the secrets that I've buried.Of course, what I end up with is not ready to share anyway. After writing atspeed I am left with something dishevelled, full of plot tangles and threads thatlead nowhere, grubby, a bit raw, and yet beautiful. The rest of the year isspent untangling, ironing and smoothing. That bit is hard work.Looking back to your teenage years, what advice would yougive your younger self?It's not a good idea to buy that wardrobe on castors for 2pat the end of the Annecy Primary School jumble sale. You will think it's abright idea to use it to wheel the box of books you've bought the three milesuphill back home, but actually one of the wheels is going to fall off halfwayup Southdown Road, and you will have to abandon the books, and the wardrobe, towalk home and alert your mum, and she will be more furious than you canpossibly imagine.But you were right to buy the books.In 1987, when you're sixteen, a book called Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway by SusanJeffers will be published. Don't wait until you're 28 to read it.If you were writing a book about your own life, what wouldthe title be?Felt The Fear For Years: Did it EventuallyWhat advice do you have for aspiring authors?Writing is something done, often, by people in privacy. It'sa self-indulgent hobby. Because relatively few authors are traditionallypublished, it can feel pointless – that publication is something that happensto 'other people' – and this becomes a stumbling block that often stops writersfrom continuing. To this I say: write. I'm giving you permission to do it, totake yourself seriously. Write at every opportunity. Don't listen to the voicethat tells you it's pointless; shout back that it doesn’t matter, you're goingto do it anyway. Write for fun; write because you have a plot that's burning inyour heart, because you have characters begging you to tell their story. Andfinish it! When you've done that, the world of publishing in its many formsopens up before you… if that's what you want.You can do it. I believe in you.And lastly, why should people read Never Alone?It made me scared while I was writing it – surely that's agood sign?About Elizabeth HaynesElizabethHaynes is a former police intelligence analyst who lives in Norfolk with herhusband and son.

With Never Alone, she's returned back to her roots. And in doing so, she has written yet another stunning novel that I couldn't put down.I felt like I was reading a masterclass in chilling psychological thrillers. From its small cast of main believable characters to the creepy and highly atmospheric setting. Her stunning descriptions of the claustrophobic North Yorkshire landscape added to the tension of the tightly woven plot.Each page is filled with emotion - fear, sorrow, anxiety, hopelessness, joy and more. And I could feel every one of them as I read - highly descriptive writing, yet no word was superfluous or out of place.Never Alone is an incredibly unsettling read. It's spine tingling and dark, with a sense of unease running throughout the book. It kept me guessing all the way through, as the tension built up to a dramatic conclusion.

Sarah's latest book, Tastes Like Fear, is being published in paperback by Headline on 28 July 2016. The Killer Women Festival is taking place at Shoreditch Town Hall, London, on 15 October 2016 - more details at the end of this blog post and on Friday. Getting Ready for Round TwoBy Sarah Hilary It’s a funny old business, writing a book.You spend months sitting alone with just the voices in your head for company,listening intently and cajoling these people onto the page. Then you hand itall over to a stranger. Well, not a stranger to you (I’mblessed with a very friendly and very talented editor), but a stranger to yourwords. To those characters you tempted out of hiding. It has all to be laidbare before the gaze of someone with a very sharp eye and a very red pen. ‘It’slike leaving your child at the school-gate,’ another writer told me. ‘You knowshe needs to be educated, that ultimately she’ll return a better person, butit’s hard.’There is a blissful space of about ten daysafter I’ve submitted my first draft before my editor has time to read it. Forthose ten days it is still ‘my’ book; it can do no wrong. In the back of myhead, of course I know it needs work. The edges need knocking off it, and morebesides. But I can hold onto the happy thought that it is complete, and in away faultless—until I have proof of its faults in the form of the editorialnotes which come back to me, always after a phone call from my editor. We ping ideas back and forth, chat about whythis character works and this one doesn’t, unstick plot points that weren’tquite working. You might think that being told there’s more work to be done ona story over which I sweated blood for six months would leave me feeling flator disheartened. But one of my editor’s many talents is to make me feelenergised—an hour on the phone and I’m raring to get stuck into round two.So here I am, with the duplicated document —renamed as v2 — and a long list of notes and changes. Wish me luck.About Sarah HilarySarah Hilary won the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year for her debut, Someone Else’s Skin. She is about to begin editing her fourth book in the Marnie Rome series, Quieter than Killing, which is out in March 2017. Her latest, Tastes Like Fear is out in paperback on 28 July.

Erin's next book, He Said/She Said, will be published by Hodder & Stoughton in February 2017.The Killer Women Festival is taking place at Shoreditch Town Hall, London, on 15 October 2016 - more details at the end of this blog post and on Friday. Unravelling the Plot KnotsBy Erin KellyI’m about ten thousand words into my seventh novel,which is a psychological thriller set in an old Victorian asylum. There arethree stories – one in 1958, when it was a working mental hospital, a second in1988 when it was derelict and now, when it has been turned into luxury flats.Usually my writing day is always the same – startas soon as the kids are at school, stop when it’s time to go and get them– but this novel is different. They say ‘write what you know’ but after acouple of books that would get very tedious for both author and reader and nowI find I research more with every book. I’ve got the bones of a plot and some key scenessketched out in a Scrivener document and on a million scraps of printer paperstuffed in bags and all over my study. I make pages and pages of plot notes inlonghand and then never look at them again: over time I’ve found that the rightideas will stay with me.With this book, more so than most of myothers, I’m hitting plot knots that need research to unravel them. This week,it’sthe highly unsexy but crucial intricacies of hospital administration in theearly 1980s; I’m interested in how the Care in the Community policy was implementedwhen the old asylums were finally shut down. When this happens I’ll catch the Tubeto the Wellcome Library in central London where they have metres of shelvesdevoted to the history of psychiatry. It’s the most amazing space – light, airy but richwith history – and I’ve started going in even on ‘writing’ days because I find itso inspirational.About Erin KellyErinKelly is best known for The Poison Tree, which was a Richard and Judybestseller and a major ITV drama. Her next psychological thriller, He Said/SheSaid, is out next February. It’s about a couple who witness a crime and only doubt their versionof events after the trial, with deadly consequences. She has no plans to moveinto romantic comedy.Find out more about Erin Kelly on her website and follow Erin on Twitter - @mserinkellyThe Killer Women FestivalThe FIRSTEVER Killer Women Crime Writing Festival takes place on Saturday 15th October 2016 at Shoreditch TownHall, London EC1.Founded in2014, Killer Women is a collective of female crime writers from London and theSouth East.

Tammy's latest book, When She Was Bad, was published by Black Swan (Penguin Random House UK) in April 2016. The Killer Women Festival is taking place at Shoreditch Town Hall, London, on 15 October 2016 - more details at the end of this blog post and on Friday. Writer's BlockBy Tammy CohenThere’s always a blissful split second when I wake upwhere my mind is a merciful blank and all’s well with the world. Then I remember the daysand weeks of false starts and empty pages that lie behind me and am floodedwith panic as I do my mental calculations. How many months until my next bookis due? How many weeks? Days?After rattling off my last novel in almostindecent haste, the new book is stubbornly refusing to get written. It seemedlike such an excellent idea when I scribbled down the two-page synopsis that myagent and editor fell in love with. But stretching out those two pages into ahundred thousand words is proving a challenge*. And my November deadline isfast approaching.It’s not through want of trying. Every day, afterwalking the dog, I sit down to write. But so far I’m struggling to find away of getting into the story. And it’s precisely when you’re struggling that theInternet suddenly becomes so irresistible. A YouTube clip of dogs actingguilty? Don’t mind if I do. When work is going badly, social media is a blackhole that swallows me up and spits me up some hours later having come up withseveral witty entries on the #BrexitMovies hashtag, but no usable words. By evening, panic has usually given way to alow level nausea that I try to assuage by watching something mindless andranting at the 10 o’clock news (and sometimes gin). After which, finally, fully-fledgedfear might prompt me to get out my laptop and get down some words. Any words.In any order. When I go to bed I remind myself that I’ve been herebefore. Writing When She Was Bad, I was completely stalled until one evening,in the bath, a voice came into my head that became a totally new thread and thewhole book instantly fell into place. That’s what I’m looking for – themagical key that unlocks this new book and lets me in to write it. I know it’s there, it’s just a questionof finding it. And in the meantime, ooh look a clip of a fireman rescuing akitten… * I’ve substituted ‘challenge’ for ‘total impossibility’, just in case my editoris reading.About Tammy CohenTammy Cohenis the author of seven novels. Her latest, When She Was Bad, came out in April2016 and is a psychological thriller set in an office.

{"title": "How I Write and Edit by Liz Nugent - Lying in Wait Blog Tour", "date": "Friday 15 July 2016", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Liz Nugent to my blog today to discuss her writing and editing process. Liz's book Lying In Wait was published by Penguin Ireland on 14 July 2016.How I Writeby Liz NugentIn telling how I write and edit, I wouldn’t want any newwriter to think that these are hard and fast rules. Every single writer has adifferent approach. I can only tell you what works for me.In the beginning, I dream up a character, I know their age,colour, gender, sexuality etc.  Before Iever write a word, I spend weeks thinking about this character, what motivatesthem, their strengths, fears and vulnerabilities. I might make occasional noteson my phone.Once I have the central character fixed in my head, I startthe process of plotting. I don’t do this separately to a first draft. This isall done at the same time, as the story can often take a different slant or anew twist when I am in the middle of writing it. I have a very broad outline inmy head, and then one day, I just begin.I do this part of the process in my local library. I likethe feeling of having people and movement around me. I need to be ‘in theworld’ when I am at this stage. I don’t write at a desk, but in one of the bigarmchairs that I suspect are placed there for the benefit of old agepensioners! I always manage to find an empty one but I prefer the ones besidethe window. I aim to write 1000 words per day. That might take threehours, or six, depending on how focussed I am. I am unable to write for more thansix hours a day. I think my head might explode if I tried. It’s really hard at this stage not to self- edit but theimportant thing is just to get the core story down on paper (the screen).  I try not to use the delete button at all.Everything can be fixed later. If I get stuck on a particular scene, I willjust move on to the next one. It’s hard.  Those people who say ‘the book wrote itself’drive me up the wall. I am very jealous of them. I would love for my book towrite itself while I lay on a beach somewhere! Like any job, writing is work. I would like to say that I write every day, but some days, Ijust know that it’s not going to happen. I try not to feel guilt on those daysand use them to swat up on any necessary research.When I have that very rough first draft done, I submit it tomy editor so that she can see the general shape of the story (DO NOT do this ifyou are working on your first novel- if you are submitting for the first time,your work needs to be extremely polished and as good as it can possibly be. Youonly get the luxury of submitting a rough draft when you have a contract and agood relationship with your editor).The time between submission and your notes meeting with youreditor is nerve wracking. There is nothing to be done between these times. When my editor comes back to me with her notes, I fall intoa well of self-pity and anguish for a few days before accepting that she isright about everything.I then start redrafting, taking on board all of my editor’snotes. This part I do at home in isolation. It is much easier than the initialplotting. A lot of writers hate this part, but I quite like it because at thisstage, at least I have a notion of where I am going and it feels like more of acollaboration than an entirely solo project. There is no specific amount oftime this will take. It really depends on how extensive the notes are. With Lying in Wait, the core story remainedintact but I rewrote about 75% of the book in five months. That sounds far morehorrifying than it was. I just keep the kettle boiled and drink lots of tea.Once that draft is accepted, the copy editors take over. Aword about copy editors: These people aregods. They are there to make you look good. Do not argue with them. They knowwhat they are doing. If they tell you that, grammatically, your sentence makesno sense, they are right. Obey. This part doesn’t take a lot of time. Youshould be able to do all of your copy edit notes in a week.Then the proofreaders take over and point out the thingsthat you, your editor, your copy editors and your husband missed. They readyour manuscript for the first time with fresh eyes looking for gaps in logic orfractures in your timeline. They can save you from making an idiot of yourself.I have often noticed small errors of fact or logic in a book, and immediately,I no longer trust the writer. The reader must trust the writer to believe inthe journey on which they are being taken. So, yes, proofreaders are gods too.That is the process. Well, that is my process. As I said, every writer is different, but I hope thatsome of you may find this interesting or useful!About Liz NugentLiz’s firstnovel Unravelling Oliver was published to critical and popular acclaim in March2014. It quickly became a firm favourite with book clubs and reader’s groups.In November of that year, it went on to win the Ireland AM Crime Novel of theYear at the Bord Gais Energy Book Awards and was long listed for theInternational Dublin Literature Prize 2016.

And they certainly don't plan to kill her andbury her in their exquisite suburban garden.Yet Andrewand Lydia Fitzsimons find themselves in this unfortunate situation.While Lydiadoes all she can to protect their innocent son Laurence and their socialstanding, her husband begins to falls apart.ButLaurence is not as naïve as Lydia thinks. And his obsession with the deadgirl's family may be the undoing of his own.My verdictWow, this is one evil book that kept me reading late into the evening. I literally couldn't put it down and had to finish it before I went to sleep. And then when I did finish it, my head was buzzing so much that I couldn't even sleep properly!I don't want to give too much away, but Lying in Wait is a book about toxic friendships and controlling relationships. It's incredibly chilling and really kept me on my toes. It's not a whodunnit - you know who's the killer from very early on and how it was done. This book is really a character study of a killer - getting inside their twisted mind. It's so cleverly plotted, with several intertwined strands and a whole host of believable characters, many of whom you just have to accept that you're going to hate.The narrative is split between Lydia (who will do anything to protect herself in the aftermath of a murder), her son Lawrence (who can't stand up for himself and has his own issues to contend with) and Karen, the victim's sister who is searching for answers. Lydia is brilliant - so messed up, but you don't realise why and how much until you keep on reading right through to the end!Lying in Wait is very dark with some great humorous moments, even darker than Unravelling Oliver, which I also loved. This is a psychological thriller that you'll want to read as it's so different from many of the others currently out there on the shelves!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest reviewClick here to read a guest post by Liz Nugent on her writing/editing process."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Anna Mazzola - The Unseeing Blog Tour", "date": "Thursday 14 July 2016", "text": "I am delighted that ANNA MAZZOLA is my Author in the Spotlight today for her Blog Tour. The Unseeing is being published by Tinder Press on 14 July 2016. What inspired you to write The Unseeing, a crime novel set in the 19thcentury?I firstheard about James Greenacre and the murder of Hannah Brown in the Suspicions ofMr Whicher. The crime is mentioned only briefly, but seized my attention as ittook place in Camberwell, not far from where I live. However, when I read theOld Bailey transcript, I realized this was Sarah Gale’s story. She was accusedof helping Greenacre to conceal the horrific murder of another woman and yetshe said virtually nothing throughout the entire trial. Given she was facingthe death sentence, I thought that was very strange. What was really going on?How easy has it been to research Victorian London and make your book asauthentic as possible?Theresearch was the easy (and fun) part. The difficult bit was knowing when tostop. I spent over a year researching Sarah Gale, the Edgware Road murder,London in the 19th century, the status of women, criminal justice, prisons,Victorian foods, education in the Regency era. Really, I should have justwritten the darned book and then filled in the gaps, which is what I’m doingwith my second: broad research, first draft, more detailed research. It helps,of course, that I have a deadline.TheUnseeing is based on the case of Sarah Gale, who was sentenced to hang for herrole in the murder of another young woman. How close to ‘real life’ are thedetails in The Unseeing and how much ‘creative licence’ have you used?As I say inthe historical note to the book, I’ve used lots of real details from the caseand all of the newspaper clippings that appear within The Unseeing are genuine.However, I ended up having to diverge from the case in some key respects inorder to produce a narrative that anyone other than a legal historian wouldactually want to read. I found that hard. I’m used to working with real cases wherefacts are all-important, so it was difficult for me to accept that I had to letgo of factual accuracy in order to achieve a different kind of narrativetruth.  It’s part of the reason that one of the key themes of The Unseeingis truth and deception.How has your background as criminal justice solicitor influenced yourfiction writing?I supposeit was because of my interest in justice and, in particular, justice for women,that I became fascinated by this particular story, and why it plays out as itdoes. I’m interested in how the criminal justice system treats vulnerablepeople and victims of crime, and how a criminal charge affects people’s lives,whether they’re acquitted or convicted, so those aspects feature in TheUnseeing. However, I can’t say that my legal knowledge was directly relevant tothe book. Whatever we think of the British justice system, we’ve come a longway from the early Victorian era!Your next book, which you’re working on at present, is also set in the19th century. What can you tell me about this book? And would you considerwriting a book set in the modern day?Yes, I’mcurrently writing my second historical crime novel, which is set on the Isle ofSkye in 1857. It’s about a young woman who goes to work for a collector offolklore and discovers that a young girl has gone missing, supposedly taken byspirits, although of course that’s not what she believes. Again, the idea wassparked by a real case, but I haven’t tried to base it on the case in the sameway that I did with The Unseeing.I’d reallylike to write something set in the 1930s or 40s next. And yes, I wouldcertainly consider writing a book set in the modern era (indeed, I had an ideafor a one a while ago) but I’m sticking with historical fiction for a whileyet. Quite keen to escape modern Britain at the moment.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Unsettling,unflowery, unpretentious, uncompromising, under required word count.Looking back to your teenage years, what advice would you give youryounger self?Go tolectures instead of the bar. Worry about money later and go travelling. I wishI’d seen more of the world before I started my career.If you were writing a book about your own life, what would the titlebe?At themoment? ‘101 Blog Pieces’. Or perhaps ‘In Search of Lost Time’. What advice do you have for aspiring authors?Don’t waitfor the right conditions or the right time. There will never be the right timeand there will always be things to do that seem more pressing than writing.Write now, whenever you can, even if it’s only for twenty minutes a day on yourcommute or during your lunch hour. It will be more than a lot of people manageand it’s the only way you’ll get anywhere.And lastly, why should people read The Unseeing?Because youtold everyone it was great. And other people seem to like it too. That’s farbetter than me plugging my own book as I’m obviously extremely biased.Thanks somuch for having me on the blog!About Anna MazzolaAnnaMazzola is a writer of historical crime fiction.

It's a gripping read and I was glued to the book from start to finish. I was particularly fascinated by the underlying true story and this is certainly one I'm interested to explore.The story focuses on Sarah Gale, who was sentenced to hang for murder, but Sarah refuses to say anything that could either help her case or hinder it. Edmund Fleetwood, the lawyer appointed to investigate, isn't sure whether Sarah's hiding something.Thanks to Anna Mazzola's gift for storytelling, I also wasn't sure whether or not Sarah could be trusted. The characters are so well developed that I actually cared what happened to them by the end of the book - and would still love to know the 'after'. The vivid descriptions brought 19th century London to life - the sights, smells and sounds - from the very first page.Anna Mazzola is certainly an author to watch, as this is an amazing debut novel.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Read my Q&A with Anna here."},

There's a link to my review at the end.My Writing Dayby Angie MarsonsPrior to last year Ihad been writing around a full time job for more than twenty years.  In many ways it became my escape from workand rather than settling down to the television or distract myself by listeningto music I would settle down to the stories in my head.I think this routinesparked what is now an ideal writing day for me.I love nothing morethan rising early and writing while much of the world is still asleep.  There is an intimacy I feel with my story whenworking in the darkness and as the day begins. There is an element of having stolen something from the day.I still write my firstdraft long hand with pencils and A4 notepads. I will never get bored of hearing the scratch of lead across the page.  For speed I have tried to work straight ontothe laptop but it just doesn’t work for me. There is something about the movement of my hand across the page thattaps into the creative part of my brain.If I’m working on afirst draft I have no access to electronics as I simply can not be trusted tostay away from emails, tweets and Facebook messages.  Being prone to procrastination and of a nosydisposition I can lose entire days to reading, commenting, responding to thingsthat can easily wait for a little while.I normally write untilaround lunchtime which is when I eat and check in with the rest of theworld.  I try to spend theafternoon doing something completely removed from writing and a bit morephysical like walking the dog or gardening or even a little retail therapy.  After dinner I might watch some television orgrab some cherished reading time but if the ideas are still buzzing around myhead and the writing hand is still able I will often return to my desk tocontinue once the sun has set.If I’m in the zone Itend to make the most of it and write as much as I can for as long as I can asthough I’m saving up for a rainy day.  Oncethe story has bitten I find it very difficult to tear myself away from theprocess as my hand can’t keep up with my head. Because of this my writing routine is rather fluid but I am very luckyto have a tolerant and understanding partner who simply shrugs and smiles andreaches, once more, for the remote control and the headphones.About Angela MarsonsAngela lives in the Black Country with her partner, their bouncy Labrador and potty-mouthed parrot.

Slowly but surely, Gina is losing hermemory.As shestruggles to cope with Gina's illness, can Zoe face up to the terrible eventsof years ago and find her way back to the people she loves?My verdictA Life Without You is a heartbreaking story of love, loss, tragedy and family secrets.Zoe and her mother Gina haven't seen each other for years, after terrible events tore the family apart. When Gina is arrested on Zoe's wedding day, Zoe realises that her mother isn't the woman she remembers and maybe it's time for them all to face past mistakes.A Life Without You focuses on early-onset Alzheimer's and its devastating impact. You can tell that the author, Katie Marsh, has had direct experience of this terrible disease by the way her characters struggle to cope. The book also portrays a damaged mother/daughter relationship and whether it's possible to forgive, forget and move on.A Life Without You is carefully layered, with beautiful writing, very real characters and a tight plot.  In some places, it's funny and heartwarming. In others, it's sad and thought provoking. All of the writing is emotionally charged. The story tore at my heartstrings and left me in tears by the end.I loved Katie Marsh's first book My Everything.

Seriously. If you think writing is an easy wayout of your personal/social/financial problems, it’s not. It takes years ofsheer hard graft for very little reward (for most). Sure, we all dream of beingthe next J K Rowling or Lee Child, or writing the next ‘Girl’ phenomenon, andsomeone reading this might be that person. But those authors, if pushed to tellyou how they made it, will give you a different answer. The path of everywriter is unique, so don’t read a list or watch a video and beat yourself upfor not following those rules. While the advice of published writers is not going to giveyou a blueprint to follow, I found inspiration in lots of things differentwriters said. So I will share the tips that I found most useful and that keptme focused. But here’s a disclaimer – they won’t make you a millionaire(probably), but might unclog a drain somewhere. I always thought I’d make agood plumber...Work out why you write. If it’s because youcan’t NOT write, if you start feeling ill when you DON’T, then that’s thecorrect answer. Anything else (especially because you want to buy a yacht) isthe wrong reason.READ. Very obvious, but virtually every writerwhose advice I’ve read has said this. Read widely and across genres – I oftenfind a lot of ideas come to me through non-fiction!Writers would make great spies (andpsychopaths). You have to believe you can write/are writing somethingphenomenal, you need that absolute confidence somewhere or you wouldn’t evenstart. Coupled with that is your natural inner critic reflecting back everynegative word anyone has ever said to you, which if it gets too loud will stopyou ever writing again. Fighting that voice and channelling your innerconfidence is a tough job. It has to be done, so polish your armour. (Thank youto my English teacher extraordinaire for providing mine!)Try your hand at different genres/voices/styles,until you find the one that fits. Get some Teflon skin. You will be told No more than you will Yes. If you can’t take rejection orcriticism, stop now. (Although a darkened room full of chocolate intravenousdrips is useful when the rejection happens…)The rule I HATE is the one that says write whatyou know. I find it so limiting. Write what you want to know. Google is yourfriend, and nowadays you can pretty much get virtual experience via YouTube foranything.Surround yourself with the right people. Youdon’t want Yes people or No people. Just balanced ones. Good luckfinding them. (And no, your mum isn’t one of them!)Stop focusing on other people who getdeals/published or how well they do or don’t do. Theirsuccess/failure/breakthrough has no relevance to you, and is just adistraction.Be nice. It won’t kill you. And people arewilling to stick with you and help you in return.The most important one – write your own rules.If writing ten words a day works for you, do it. If listening to music willkeep the words flowing, do it.So there you go. And if anyone does make millions followingthese tips, feel free to share. Thank you.About Alex CaanAlex Caan was born in Manchester, and has spent over adecade working in Information Systems Security for a number of governmentorganisations, and is currently specialising in Terrorism Studies.

All Is Not Forgotten is being published by HQ Stories next week. Journey to PublicationBy Wendy WalkerAfter I had my first son eighteen yearsago, I decided to stay home to raise my children until they were all in school.I felt lucky to be able to do that and so I took the job very seriously! Butafter about a year, I started to feel unfulfilled so I started to writewhenever I had free time (which was not very often!). I had two more childrenin five years and all the while I kept writing. I even wrote in the back of myminivan while waiting for them at pre-school! I felt like a time scavenger,especially after I found an agent who thought she could sell my work. Ofcourse, life is never that straight forward! It was a long road and 17 yearsgetting to the writing and publication of AllIs Not Forgotten. During that time, I published other novels, edited, andeventually went back to work as a lawyer (after 14 years away from the field).The work I found was in the area of family law and it was a wonderful fit formy life experience. I practiced for five years, eventually opening up my ownpractice, which focuses on consulting.My first two published novels were called Four Wives(2008) and Social Lives (2009). These books involvedstories of women in wealthy suburbs struggling with their identities,marriages, children, and former lives. I have lived in suburban Connecticutmost of my life, both as a child and a grown woman, and I find it fascinating!Here, many women quit their highly skilled jobs to take care of homes andfamilies while their husbands work long hours and travel for jobs in finance. Thisalways made me think about Betty Friedan and her seminal work, The Feminine Mystique. I built my plotsaround these themes of economic dependency and the division of labor withinfamilies where both partners are highly skilled and educated.After I started practicing law again, Inever gave up the dream of making a career as a writer. I used to tell my boysthat it was important to always have a dream, but to also be responsible. I didnot stop working as a lawyer. But I also managed to keep writing! I signed witha new agent and she loved the concept of a psychological thriller based onmemory science, an idea I came up with nearly five years earlier but never gotaround to writing. I was a bit nervous about writing in a new genre, but I hadalways enjoyed reading suspense and thrillers and I was very interested in thisstory concept. So I dusted it off and wrote AllIs Not Forgotten.  It was greatadvice and I am so glad that my children may get to see my dream come true(fingers crossed) so that they will believe what I told them about havingdreams and never giving up – even if you have to keep your day job!I am currently writing almost full time-but my doors are open and I still have a few clients. I just finished a draftof a new psychological thriller and am working on revisions. About Wendy WalkerWendy Walker hasworked as an attorney specializing in family law.

{"title": "Blackout by Ragnar Jónasson", "date": "Wednesday 6 July 2016", "text": "BlackoutBy Ragnar JónassonPublished by Orenda Books (Kindle - 30 June 2016; Paperback - 15 July 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633465Publisher's descriptionOn theshores of a tranquil fjord in Northern Iceland, a man is brutally beaten todeath on a bright summer's night. As the 24-hour light of the arctic summer istransformed into darkness by an ash cloud from a recent volcanic eruption, ayoung reporter leaves Reykajvik to investigate on her own, unaware that aninnocent person's life hangs in the balance. Ari Thor Arason and his colleagueson the tiny police force in Siglufjordur struggle with an increasinglyperplexing case, while their own serious personal problems push them to thelimit. What secrets does the dead man harbour, and what is the young reporterhiding? As silent, unspoken horrors from the past threaten them all, and thedarkness deepens, it’s a race against time to find the killer before someoneelse dies...My verdictI'm a huge fan of Ragnar Jónasson's Dark Iceland series. And there's no doubt that Blackout is his darkest book yet. This is actually set between the two previous books - Snowblind and Nightblind - and shows that the author is an incredibly versatile writer. All of the Dark Iceland novels read like old-fashioned whodunnits set in modern times. But they're certainly NOT formulaic, as each book has given me a completely different reading experience.While reading Blackout, I felt like I was among old friends, with the book's familiar characters and location. Siglufjordur, where the series is set, is a small close-knit and somewhat claustrophobic community, where everyone knows one another and many of the locals are related. Blackout is set in 2010, right in the middle of the volcanic ash cloud disruption to European air space. This provides an even darker setting than usual and gives the author plenty of scope to write his stunning, vivid and very atmospheric descriptions of the Icelandic landscape.Local policeman Ari Thor and his colleagues are investigating a brutal murder that took place on the shores of a fjord. Ari Thor takes less of a major role in this book, as a young reporter is conducting her own investigations into the identity of the killer. He's distracted by problems at work and those on the domestic front, fighting his own demons and making some highly rash decisions that he could regret later on.The plot of Blackout is far more complex than that of the previous Dark Iceland books, with various different strands that at first seemed unrelated. The suspense and intrigue built up gradually with many surprises along the way. And as the jigsaw pieces slotted into place, there were several breath-holding final chapters.I couldn't wait to read Blackout, so bought it soon after the ebook release. The only drawback now is that I have to wait until Spring 2017 to read the next book, Rupture. Looks like I may have to read all three of the current books again to tide me over until then.Gone AstrayBy Michelle DaviesPublished by Macmillan (24 March 2016)ISBN: 978-1447284178Publisher's descriptionLesley andher husband Mack are the sudden winners of a £15 million EuroMillions jackpot.They move with their 15-year-old daughter Rosie to an exclusive gated estate inBuckinghamshire, leaving behind their ordinary lives - and friends - as theyare catapulted into wealth beyond their wildest dreams.But it soonturns into their darkest nightmare when, one beautiful spring afternoon, Lesleyreturns to their house to find it empty: their daughter Rosie is gone.DC MaggieNeville is assigned to be Family Liaison Officer to Lesley and Mack, supportingthem while quietly trying to investigate the family. And she has a crisisthreatening her own life - a secret from the past that could shatter everythingshe's worked so hard to build.As Lesleyand Maggie desperately try to find Rosie, their fates hurtle together on acollision course that threatens to end in tragedy . . .Moneycan't buy you happiness.Thetruth could hurt more than a lie.Onemoment really can change your life forever.My verdictGone Astray is a well-written cross between a police procedural and psychological thriller.It follows a family whose lives changed drastically when they won millions of pounds and they start drifting apart. Money really doesn't buy happiness and isn't the answer to many of life's problems - and this is the main theme of the plot. When teenage daughter Rosie goes missing, family secrets and lies bubble to the surface.Gone Astray is tightly plotted, and there were several twists and turns that kept me guessing until the end. I read most of the book in one sitting - it's fast paced, compelling and easy to read. The characters are believable and I enjoyed reading the investigation from the point of view of a Family Liaison Officer - providing an insight into their work.This is the first in the DC Maggie Neville series - I really warmed to her as a character and look forward to seeing what's next in store for this troubled Family Liaison Officer. The author's experience as a freelance women's magazine journalist is apparent in her writing - mixing crime and family dynamics very well together to produce a great debut novel."},

Is life better because you’ve racked up years of experience and learntfrom your mistakes?  Are you more comfortable now in your own skin anddon’t worry about what others think of you? I can definitely answer yes to bothquestions and my more mature outlook impacts on who I am as a person and that’sreflected in my writing.My debut novel, Talkof the Toun, was published last year when I was 47 after ten yearspractising the craft of writing. Why did it take me so long? Because I had alot to learn about things like the narrative arc and also needed to develop mywriting ‘voice’.  Could I have achieved my dream of being a publishedwriter earlier? Who knows, all I know is that during those thirty odd years Iwas busy living and all the positive and negative situations I experienced haveshaped me as a person and now have an impact on my writing.Ageing is a topic I’m drawn to, especially in women, and howgetting older impacts on their sense of self and role in society, such as thedebates about using older females as presenters in the media. Buy Buy Baby, is the bittersweet questof two very different women united by the same desire – they desperately want ababy.  But what lengths will Julia and Carolgo to have a baby in their arms?One of the issues facing Julia is that her biological clock isticking louder than ever as she’s 39 and moans that, “All I want is to find Mr Right before I become Ms Wrinkly!” Shepanics and decides to pursue her goal of becoming a mum, whether she has a manin her life or not.Although I started writing later in life, I had my own childrenrelatively young, and gave birth to my first son when I was aged 25. What if Ihadn’t found the right man to father my children? Would I have accepted thisand remained childless or felt like Julia, as if there was something missing inmy life?I was also very lucky not to have any problems gettingpregnant or unlike Carol, I have never experienced the death of my child. Howwould a tragedy like that shape me as a person?These are the questions I wanted to explore in Buy Buy Baby and I hope readers willenjoy pondering them too.About Helen MacKinvenHelen MacKinven writes contemporary Scottish fiction, with a particular interest in exploring themes such as social class and identity, using black comedy and featuring Scots dialect.

{"title": "On re-writing by Carys Bray - The Museum of You Blog Tour author guest post", "date": "Monday 4 July 2016", "text": "It's my stop on the blog tour for The Museum of You by Carys Bray. I'm delighted to welcome Carys to my blog today. The Museum of You was published by Hutchinson on 16 June 2016.On re-writingby Carys BrayI am a really slow writer. I try not to look at otherpeople’s #amwriting word counts on Twitter because they make me feelinadequate. If I manage 1,000 words a day I feel like I’m doing well. I edit asI write, which can slow things down but it also means that I’m largely happywith what exists at the end of the first draft. That’s not to say that thereisn’t a lot of trimming and rearranging of sentences and paragraphs – there is,but at least what I have is novel-shaped.I know how my novels will open and close before I startwriting, and I think that has helped me to avoid massive, structural edits (sofar!). In the beginning, I make notes. I find it easier to be slapdash in anotebook. Plus, I can leave the notebook by the side of my bed for when I thinkI’ve had an amazing idea in the middle of the night (mostly, the ideas aren’tamazing and tend to be incomprehensible by morning). In The Museum of You, 12 year old Clover Quinn likes to watchThe Great British Bake Off. Although she and her Dad, Darren, don’t do much baking,Darren makes an attempt to join in with the programme each week. Here are somenotes I made for a scene about a biscuit showstopper:When I transferred the scene to my laptop I filled it out alittle. Then I read it aloud. Hearing the words sometimes makes me realise thatI’ve repeated myself or expressed something in a convoluted way. A passage hasits own particular music which can be spoiled by a sentence that is overly longor short. Reading aloud is also good for dialogue. If a section of dialogue ishard to read aloud, perhaps it needs further work. Here’s how the scene with Darren and the biscuits appears inthe novel: And that’s how I write and rewrite: a rough outline, a moredetailed attempt, some reading aloud and then some trimming and rearranging.Eventually, I end up with around 90,000 trimmed and rearranged words, and thenit’s time to go back to the beginning for more of the same. Of course, I’ve only written two novels and I don’t knowwhether I’ll necessarily be able to approach a third novel in the same way, butthat’s part of the fun and the terror of beginning again, with a blank notebookand an empty Word document.

His debut thriller - Wicked Game - was published by Orenda Books on 15 March 2016. You originally started writing to help with Post TraumaticStress Disorder. There’s growing research and evidence that writing cansignificantly improve physical and emotional health. How do you think writingbenefited you, as part of your PTSD management?Yes, writing is becoming a more recognised and popular formof therapy for PTSD. My understanding on the way it works is this:Talking about the causes, effects and symptoms of thecondition can be a very emotional experience, sometimes overwhelmingly so. But it is a way of achieving acceptance and bringing unconscious memory undercontrol. So, the more you talk about it, the less it upsets and the less of aburden it becomes. Writing is a way of helping someone who really struggles toexpress themselves verbally, either through lack of the words to articulatetheir experiences or through being overwhelmed when trying to speak about them.Writing gets you to focus and to record. It acts in a cathartic way and seemsto work as if it were the equivalent benefit achieved by talking, butmultiplied many times.Wicked Game was originally self-published. Now it’spublished by Orenda Books. Do you think you have grown as a writer through yourexperiences of the different publishing processes? If so, how?Ioften read comments by self-published authors regarding the more satisfactorylevel of control they have over the whole process concerning the production,the design and the marketing of their book. I respect that, but for me, I havefound that signing with a highly motivated and skilled publisher has broughthuge dividends. I was given the opportunity to work with an editing team whowere very instrumental in developing me as a writer. I have learned a greatdeal from them. My writing is raw, it’s me, and that means I have a style of myown, but I still had a lot to learn to polish it up ready for the commercialmarket. The Orenda team gave me a fast-track education in creative writing andI freely admit that the end result is a much improved version of my originalstory.Otherthings have come about as well. The jacket design for the book was incredibleand had no input from me, and that is a good thing, as I now realise just howcreative are the people that produced such work. In terms of marketing, thebook has reached vendors, readers and places that I would have never thoughtpossible and which I could have never achieved when self-published. Also, I’vebeen interviewed on radio and television, invited to speak at numerous literaryevents and festivals, and had a launch at Waterstones flagship store with overa hundred people in attendance. All this has only been possible because of theprofessionalism and experience of Orenda. Wicked Game is an action thriller based on your ownexperiences. How easy/challenging has it been to write a book that’s so ‘closeto home’?Not too easy. But, if writing a book was easy, everyonewould be doing it! Add to that the emotional engagement that my writingproduces and, yes, I sometimes struggle and I do find that there are times whenI have to stop and take a break. I do research, but a lot of my writing drawson personal experience. As I write, memories return of times long-forgotten andsome of those recollections are not too pleasant. But, I think that emotionhelps me write and I hope it comes through in the result.Wicked Game hasbeen long-listed for the CWA John Creasy New Blood Dagger Award 2016. What wasthe first thing that went through your mind when your name was announced?You were there! It caught me completely by surprise. Firstlybecause there were hundreds of entries and, secondly because I thought the bookhad been nominated under a different category. So, when the ‘debut’ author listdidn’t include me, I thought that was it. So, there I was, chatting to authorZoe Sharp and not really paying attention when the announcer read out my nameand the name of the book. My first feelings were ones of surprise, thenslightly confused when so many people came up to me to extend theircongratulations. Within minutes, I had a text from Peter James. I then began torealise that this might be quite significant – let’s not forget that I’ve onlybeen exposed to the publishing world for a couple of months – and so I went andgave Karen, my publisher, a kiss. Wicked Game was the result of a team effortand I felt pleased on her behalf, as I know how much she ploughs into herauthors and it was nice to also see the name of Orenda up on the screen aswell.Looking at your website, you’ve had a busy year so far, withyour book launch, blog tour, events, book festivals, interviews and articles.So what’s coming up next? And do you get much free time?With the amount of hobbies and interests I have, I need freetime, believe me! I watch very little television, preferring to read and tolisten to the radio and the hobbies range from riding the Harley through tobee-keeping. I’m retired from full-time work now, so writing is my priority.Most of my working day is spent on social media, research and writing. I havetwo more scheduled literary festivals, at Crickhowell and Berwick, and aninterview at Harrogate Crimefest to do with Peter James for his new YouTubechannel. I now do talks with Armed Services Veterans at Combat Stress, so I’malso looking forward to doing these and I’ve just been taken on by apublic-speaking agency to do talks. The audio book of Wicked Game comes out inAugust so I’m just about to record an interview for that production as well.And, of course, I am writing. Book two, the sequel to Wicked Game, is now withOrenda for editing. I am 20K words into my third. This will complete thetrilogy that is the story of Robert Finlay, but he will be back, trust me!Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Raw, authentic and, to quote Ran Fiennes, engaging.Looking back to your teenage years, what advice would yougive your younger self?I would tell myself to study now, chase the girls later. Ireally should have focused on my studies more than I did. I would ignore theadvice, of course. Teenagers need to learn for themselves and, with the way mylife has panned out, I’ve no complaints.If you were writing a book about your own life, what wouldthe title be?One life, live it.What advice do you have for aspiring authors?That’s very kind – calling me an author. Just a few shortmonths ago I wouldn’t dared have whispered the word. I’m very new to this, so Ithink the best advice I could pass on would be two pieces of advice that weregiven to me.1. Don’t even think about becoming an author if you don’tenjoy writing. You’ll spend many hours at the keyboard, suffer self-doubt andfrustration and experience seemingly endless rejections. If you don’t enjoy theact of writing, you will never stick it.2. Writing is a craft that you can start at any age – don’tbe in a hurry. Many authors start quite late in life as it is only by that timethat they have something within them worth writing about.And lastly, why should people read Wicked Game?Mostly I would say read it so that you can tell me what youthought of it. I’ve been pleasantly surprised at the wide range of readingtastes it seems to appeal to. Now, the plug…‘Wicked Game’ will appeal to many readers as it is a storyabout family secrets. Every family has one, some have many, but not every familyfaces the threat of being murdered if it is exposed.Robert Finlay is a husband with a secret. It is hidden fromnot just his family, but from almost everybody he is now connected to.But secrets are like seeds. Although they can stay buriedfor a long time, eventually they send up shoots, surface, and give themselvesaway.And so begins ‘Wicked Game’, a game of cat and mouse, whereFinlay’s family, his friends, indeed his very existence is under threat from adetermined and unidentified enemy.An enemy that will stop at nothing to see them dead.About Matt JohnsonMatt Johnson is not a typical author. He is not formally trained,finished his English language education at the age of sixteen and only startedwriting to help with treatment for Post Traumatic Stress problems. Writing helped Matt come to terms with and manage his PTSD. Matt Johnsonstarted writing crime scene reports as a detective, then recollections as partof his PTSD therapy, before turning his hand to thriller writing.A quiet, contemporary countryman, Matt lives in a converted barn and, on a daily basis, exercises his four gundogs.

{"title": "Florence Grace by Tracy Rees", "date": "Thursday 30 June 2016", "text": "Florence GraceBy Tracy ReesPublished by Quercus (30 June 2016)ISBN: 978-1784296179Publisher's descriptionFlorrieBuckley is an orphan, living on the wind-blasted moors of Cornwall. It's a hardexistence but Florrie is content; she runs wild in the mysterious landscape.She thinks her destiny is set in stone. But when Florrie is fifteen, sheinherits a never-imagined secret. She is related to a wealthy and notoriousLondon family, the Graces. Overnight, Florrie's life changes and she moves fromcountry to city, from poverty to wealth. Cut off from everyone she has everknown, Florrie struggles to learn the rules of this strange new world. And thenshe must try to fathom her destructive pull towards the enigmatic and troubledTurlington Grace, a man with many dark secrets of his own.My verdictI really enjoyed Tracy Rees' first book Amy Snow, so was delighted when I fell in love with Florence Grace too, as I did have high expectations.Florence Grace is page-turning historical fiction. It's the story of a young girl who is plucked from the remote Cornwall moors to discover she is part of a wealthy London family. Not all of her new relatives welcome her into the fold, however, and Florrie has a lot to learn about life in a city - and about large families.Tracy Rees has captured the settings of Cornwall and London beautifully, with her vivid descriptive writing. Her dialogue is very realistic, as it was in Amy Snow, which makes the characters themselves feel very real and in keeping with the book's time period. Florence Grace is definitely a character-led novel, focusing on how the characters interact and respond to one another - in a family that should be close knit but isn't, thanks to its many lies, secrets and conflicts. Florrie is definitely the star of the show and it was interesting to see how she grew and flourished throughout the book.Florence Grace is a story of belonging, destiny, secrets and courage. It was very easy to immerse myself in this emotional story and I read most of the book in one sitting. This is certainly a book I'll be recommending.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through the Lovereading panel in exchange for an honest review."},

Her debut novel - Between You and Me - was published by Carina in March 2016. Your debut psychological thriller Between You and Me went straight to the top of the Amazon charts inMarch. Describe how your life has changed over the last few months?Everything has been very busy – I never realised quite howmuch other stuff goes on behind the scenes once your book has been published! Your next book – TellMe No Lies – is being published in October 2016. Does it seem verydifferent second time round?There’s a lot more pressure the second time around – I wrotewhen I could when I was writing the first book, but the pressure of a deadlinemeant that I HAD to write at every spare moment for Book Two. Plus, there’s theadded worry that readers might not like it as much as Book One!Why do you think psychological thrillers are so popular,especially with female readers?I think us ladies like to scare ourselves a bit…and it justso happens that we find everyday, ordinary things more scary than ghosts,monsters etc. The fact that things that happen in psych thrillers canpotentially happen to all of us in real life is quite terrifying. You’re off to New York in July for Thrillerfest, on a panelfor debut authors – your first panel. Are you terrified, excited…? A bit of both! I’m very excited to be meeting up with myfellow ITW debuts, but equally I’m a bit terrified about speaking on the panel,as it’s the first one I’ve done. I did a radio show last month which was scary,but not as bad as I thought it would be! You’ve had a successful book blog for a number of years. Doyou think reviewing books has helped you as an author?I think the book reviewing gave me the courage to write myown book and put it out there. It was festering in the back of my mind for along time but the idea of people reading something I had written wasterrifying. Once I started reviewing and people started reading my words Imanaged to get over it a bit.How do you make sure you’re getting the words down whenyou’re writing a first draft? What’s your writing routine like?I am the queen of procrastination! I set myself a target of2000 words a day – I don’t always hit it, but I find that once the words startcoming I can usually make it, although not all of it makes it to the final cut.I should probably switch the Internet off when I’m writing, if I’m honest!Looking back to your teenage years, what advice would yougive your younger self?Don’t think you just have to settle for what you have – youcan do it; you just have to push yourself.What advice do you have for aspiring authors, having been inthat position not that long ago yourself?Don’t give up – you just need your manuscript to land on theright desk at the right time.And lastly, why should people read Between You and Me?          Because it’s brilliant (apparently!).About Lisa HallLisa loves words, reading and everythingthere is to love about books. She has dreamed of being a writer since she was alittle girl – either that or a librarian - and after years of talking about it,was finally brave enough to put pen to paper (and let people actually read it).Lisa lives in a small village in Kent, surrounded by her towering TBR pile, arather large brood of children, dogs, chickens and ponies and herlong-suffering husband.

Since her mother'sdeath, eighteen-year-old half-French, half-Vietnamese Nicole has been living inthe shadow of her beautiful older sister, Sylvie. When Sylvie is handed controlof the family silk business, Nicole is given an abandoned silk shop in theVietnamese quarter of Hanoi. But the area is teeming with militant rebels whowant to end French rule, by any means possible. For the first time, Nicole isawakened to the corruption of colonial rule - and her own family's involvementshocks her to the core...Tran, a notorious Vietnamese insurgent,seems to offer the perfect escape from her troubles, while Mark, a charmingAmerican trader, is the man she's always dreamed of. But who can she trust inthis world where no one is what they seem?The Silk Merchant's Daughter is a captivating tale of dark secrets, sisterly rivalry and loveagainst the odds, enchantingly set in colonial era Vietnam.My verdictThe Silk Merchant's Daughter is a fascinating tale of a young woman torn between two cultures, thanks to her mixed parentage. Nicole's father is a wealthy French silk merchant while her mother (who died in childbirth) was Vietnamese. The book is set at a time of turmoil in Vietnam, as militant rebels want to end French rule.The book is beautifully descriptive, bringing 1950s Vietnam to life. I was engrossed in the culture references and political background, as the author transported me to Hanoi - with its sights, sounds and aromas. Initially Nicole knows little about her Vietnamese background. But when her father gives her an abandoned silk shop in the Vietnamese quarter, she gradually learns more about her mother's heritage and about where she herself belongs. In gaining her independence, she becomes involved in a world of corruption and espionage.The Silk Merchant's Daughter was partly a coming of age novel, as Nicole grows from a naive teenager to a more level-headed young woman. The book is also a tale of sibling rivalry, between Nicole and her older sister Sylvie, a love story and a family saga. There were plenty of surprises throughout and it was very difficult to know which characters Nicole should trust.I really enjoyed The Silk Merchant's Daughter and thought that the book packed a lot into its pages. I remained intrigued by the family secrets until the final page.I received an Advance Reader Copy direct from the publisher and through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Kill Your Darlings - by Rebecca Bradley - an author guest post ", "date": "Monday 27 June 2016", "text": "Today it's my stop on the blog tour for Made to be Broken by Rebecca Bradley. I'm delighted to welcome Rebecca to my blog. Made to be Broken was published on 20 June 2016.Kill Your Darlingsby Rebecca BradleyCan I first start thispost by thanking Vicki for hosting me on her blog. Over the past week or so, Ihave found out just how wonderful and kind the blogging community really is andVicki is among those filled with kindness. So, thank you Vicki. Advicegiven to new writers is to ‘Kill yourdarlings’. You can trace this quote back to William Faulkner who said ‘Inwriting, you must kill all your darlings.’ It was then compounded by StephenKing when he said ‘Kill your darlings,even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler’s heart, kill yourdarlings.’ This advice isn’t about killing off your characters, but aboutthe harsh slice of the editing pen. When going through your manuscript you aretold to make sure to kill those darling words, be harsh, get rid of any thatdon’t earn their keep. If they are there simply because you love the way theysound, but they hold no value, then they have to go. So,am I going to tell you about my editing process today? How I rid my manuscriptof all my beautiful and lyrical prose that I wish I could keep but it has noplace in the Major Incident Room of DI Hannah Robbins?No.I’mactually going to talk about killing my actual darlings. My characters. But,not really kill them. Confused?Alot of series fiction has a regular set of characters. A team of detectives whodeal with the crimes that occur on their watch. They get put through the millat every opportunity and generally their lives are twisted upside down. When Iset out writing, I wanted my series to be a little different. Having workedsixteen years in the police service I know life isn’t like that. It’s rare youwork with exactly the same team year after year. The team you are a part ofchanges in a very fluid manner. People apply and join the team as and whensomeone else leaves or extra staff are needed. But when it comes to leaving,there are a multitude of reasons for someone moving on. You can have someoneleave temporarily on maternity, move for promotion purposes, move for a sidewaysmove in a change in department because of their own career plans, retirement, aforced move because the job requires staff somewhere else and sometimes peoplejust decide to leave the job. Any police department is an evolving unit.Ifthe reality is so carousel like, I wanted my fiction to mirror this. I don'twant my readers to be comfortable with any book they read in the series, I wantthem always to be wondering if any character safe, is one of their favouritesgoing to be leaving? It's not that I want to torture my readers, it's that Iwant to insert a reality and also some unexpectedness. Policeprocedural novels, as the phrase itself indicates, are usually run as a policemurder investigation. Though, it's the case itself that gives the story itspunch, as procedure isn't very gripping. So,I thought if we can, in some way, have a fluidity of movement within thecharacters and is something else other than the main story, it’ll make it bothrealistic and, hopefully interesting as readers find out if their favouritecharacter is going to make it through. That's not to say I want to make changesin every single book, because again you can go quite long periods of time withquite a stable team and I’m also not going to keep making changes for the sakeof making changes. But,at the end of the day, the only safe character in the series is Hannah Robbinsbecause it is the DI Hannah Robbins series.Though,don't test me on that… *Evil cackleHowdo you feel about this, the movement of characters? Does it make you uneasy asyou like a regular cast of characters, or do you think this could be aninteresting look at a working series?About Rebecca BradleyRebecca Bradley is a retired police detective who lives in Nottinghamshire with her family and her two cockapoos Alfie and Lola.

{"title": "Epiphany Jones by Michael Grothaus - Blog Tour Review", "date": "Thursday 23 June 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the Blog Tour for Epiphany Jones by Michael Grothaus, which was published in paperback by Orenda Books on 16 May 2016. Here's my review of this unique and fantastic book.Epiphany JonesBy Michael GrothausPublished by Orenda Books (16 May 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633335Publisher's descriptionJerry has atraumatic past that leaves him subject to psychotic hallucinations anddepressive episodes. When he stands accused of stealing a priceless Van Goghpainting, he goes underground, where he develops an unwilling relationship witha woman who believes that the voices she hears are from God. Involuntarilyentangled in the illicit world of sex-trafficking amongst the Hollywood elite,and on a mission to find redemption for a haunting series of events from thepast, Jerry is thrust into a genuinely shocking and outrageously funny quest touncover the truth and atone for historical sins.My verdictEpiphany Jones is a book that's as unique in content as it is in name. I don't think I have ever read a book quite like it. And I possibly won't find one again - although obviously I look forward to seeing what Michael Grothaus has in store next.The book is about the sex trafficking industry, child abuse and how celebrity lifestyles aren't always the fairytale that we're led to believe. When Jerry is wrongly accused of stealing a priceless painting and murdering his colleague, he goes on the run with the help of a mysterious woman called Epiphany Jones. It soon becomes clear that Epiphany has her own agenda - and will do anything to make him comply with her demands.I found it very difficult to put this novel down. Humour cushions the darkness and the madness, and I found myself laughing when I really shouldn't be laughing. Never before have I read a book in which a porn addict sees people who aren't there and a young troubled woman hears voices in her head that predict her future. Yet bizarrely, it all seemed so believable and real.Just to warn you, Epiphany Jones isn't for the faint hearted - it's certainly a book that will take most readers out of their comfort zone. It's graphic from the outset, with hard-hitting language and vivid descriptions, and it covers some very shocking and traumatic issues. The book contains scenes that you may wish you hadn't pictured in your head as you read - yet it's so highly gripping and well written that you just can't help it. Not much fazes me, but some scenes still had me gasping out loud.Despite its violence and dark humour, the book has a highly emotional journey at its core and left me reeling and in tears. Epiphany Jones may be the author's debut, but it certainly doesn't read like one with its high level of sophistication, depth and talent. Yet again, Orenda Books has found a novel that will grab your attention straight away - from the very first line (yes, it's that good) - and stir up all of your emotions (from fear, disgust and anger to sadness, surprise and joy).If you're looking for...something very different to readthat will keep you engrossed into the early hours of the morningthat tackles some very real and disturbing issuesthat's totally insane, quirky, dark, emotional and compellingand that will stay with you for a long time afterwards... then you must buy this book.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "The Killing Files by Nikki Owen", "date": "Monday 20 June 2016", "text": "The Killing FilesBy Nikki OwenPublished by Mira Books (2 June 2016)ISBN: 978-1848454415Publisher's descriptionDr Maria Martinez is out of prison and on the run.Her mission? To get back to the safety of her family.Little does she know that this might be the most dangerousplace of all…Don’t miss the second in Nikki Owen’s electrifying Projecttrilogy, perfect for fans of Nicci French and Charles Cumming.My verdictThe Killing Files is the second book in The Project Trilogy, a fascinating and action-packed series of thrillers. It's a fast paced, easy and relatively quick read filled with science and high octane moments.Family secrets, lies and deception dominate the complex and intriguing story, which explores Maria's mysterious past. Maria's Aspergers is a main part of the plot, something you don't often find in crime or action thrillers. This gives The Killing Files a unique feel. The introduction of a new character, Chris, injects some humour into the book, especially in relation to his association with Maria. I'm hoping their friendship will be explored further in the final instalment of the trilogy.The story switches between the past and present. The past is the 'what happens in the lead up to the present day' so there's actually very little time between the two different threads. There are also some flashbacks to Maria's earlier life and her association with the mysterious 'Project'.As the book progresses, the tension builds up, with so many twists and turns that it left me quite breathless. Maria has no idea to trust - and nor did I, as the reader.I suggest you read the first book - Subject 375/The Spider in the Corner of the Room - beforehand. This second book picks up not long after the previous one and I don't feel it could be read as a standalone very easily. You need the background in the first book to understand the characters, and you may miss out on the whole dynamics of the plot if you don't read these books in order.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Lucy Beresford - Blog Tour", "date": "Friday 17 June 2016", "text": "I am delighted that LUCY BERESFORD is joining me on my blog today for her blog tour. Lucy's latest book - Hungry For Love - was published by Quartet Books on 26 May 2016. Your latest novel Hungry For Love is romantic fiction about food and love, but ‘shows you the importance of self-respect’. In Something I’m Not (published in 2008), you looked at whether all women want to be mothers. Your background is psychotherapy – do you think it’s important that all of your novels have a deeper meaning or pose questions that women are afraid to ask?Wow, firstly thank you for exploring myback catalogue! I wouldn’t say all novels have to ask deep questions, butpersonally I adore books that explore relationships and I don’t think you cando that without having characters that are grappling with the kinds of thingswe’re all trying to work out. When I was writing Something I’m Not, myfriends and I were all discussing that very thing – do we want kids. And for Hungry for Love everywhere I looked people were trying to mend a brokenheart, find love again and, above all, develop self-respect. I don’t likeair-brushed, neat characters; mine are emotionally messy – like me.Your novels vary considerably in subject matter but often tackle controversial issues. In Invisible Threads (published in 2015), you covered the sex trade in India. Is there any subject that you wouldn’t feel comfortable tackling?'Write what you know' is often whatpeople are told, but I think that’s often misunderstood. I don’t know what itfeels like to be a girl who has been trafficked (Invisible Threads) but I knowabout loss and fear. Similarly, I’ve not cancelled my wedding on the day, asJax does at the start of Hungry for Love, but I know what it’s like to feelbetrayed. So it’s possible that any topic is open to me, so long as I can findthe right emotion. Although I suspect I might have to draw the line atFootball, as I’m utterly clueless. What’s the most interesting place that you have visited when researching one of your novels? And what’s the strangest?Definitely the most gripping place wasthe red light area in Delhi when researching my last novel Invisible Threads. Isaw some shocking sights but also you could tell the girls were trying to lookout for each other. The best has to be the two cookery schools I went to (inThailand and Majorca) when writing Hungry for Love – hilarious! Mouthwateringfood, as you can imagine, but also observing relationships forming and thenbreaking up – like watching back-to-back episodes of Love Island!Your non-fiction book – Happy Relationships at Home, Work and Play – was published in 2013. How easy do you find switching between writing fiction and non-fiction? Do you tackle them very differently?I write fiction or non-fiction ondifferent days. And although I like to plan my novels, I allow lots of scopefor playfully seeing what comes up while I’m writing, whereas when I’m writingnon-fiction I stick to the script.    If you were writing a book about your own life, what would the title be?Ha! Probably 'Call me Monica', afterMonica in Friends. My friends call me that – heaven knows why!!!What advice would you give your younger self?What a great question… wouldn’t we alllove to go back in a time machine and reassure our younger self. It would haveto be something like: you’re beautiful and strong and magical things are goingto happen, so don’t worry so much.  What advice do you have for aspiring fiction writers?It’s going to sound rather plain, but myonly advice is to write. Write every day, every evening or every weekend, butjust write. If you don’t write, you can’t become a writer. And lastly, why should people read Hungry For Love?Read Hungry for Love not only becauseit’s very funny, has a hilarious TV chef mother character who was great fun towrite and has mouth-watering descriptions of food and recipes, but because itwill remind you that love will come when you stop trying to please other peopleand instead learn to love yourself.About Lucy BeresfordLucy is awriter, broadcaster, psychotherapist and documentary maker.

{"title": "Deadly Harvest by Michael Stanley - BLOG TOUR REVIEW", "date": "Tuesday 14 June 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Deadly Harvest by Michael Stanley, which was published by Orenda Books on 15 May 2016. Read on for my review.Deadly HarvestBy Michael StanleyPublished by Orenda Books (15 May 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633441Publisher's descriptionA younggirl goes missing after getting into a car with a mysterious man. Soon after, asecond girl disappears, and her devastated father, Witness, sets out to seekrevenge. As the trail goes cold, Samantha Khama - new recruit to the BotswanaCriminal Investigation Department - suspects that the girl was killed for muti;traditional African medicine. She enlists opera-loving wine connoisseurAssistant Superintendent David 'Kubu' Benga to help her dig into the past. Butas they begin to find a pattern, Kubu and Samantha suddenly find they are in arace against time...My verdictDeadly Harvest is a brilliant crime novel set in a sunny climate. I absolutely loved its exotic setting - not only did the book interest and entertain me but I also learnt so much from it. Botswana truly comes alive on the pages, with its aromas, sights and sounds, as well as political background, providing a fascinating culture to explore further.The plot concentrates on witch doctors and the use of human remains in traditional African medicines. This is based on a true story, when a young girl went missing in 1994. If you've been following some recent newspaper stories, you'll realise that hunters selling body parts to witch doctors is still very much an ongoing problem. The underlying tragic and horrific truth really brings the book to life. There's also mention of AIDS and HIV, raising often forgotten health issues affecting Africa today.The book is beautifully written and gripping from the first page until the last, with a few surprises along the way. Who is kidnapping young girls by enticing them into their car? Why has no one seen these girls again? This is a modern mystery, yet feels timeless, as the detectives search for clues.I loved Detective Kubu and his stable family setting, which provided some lighter moments amidst all the darkness, corruption and deception. His character proves that detectives don't always have to be driven by inner turmoil, as seen so often in crime fiction. He was a complete contrast to Samantha Khama, the new female detective who is far more hot headed and ready to dive in without thinking first. I thought there would be a more explosive clash of personalities, but both characters managed to develop a professional relationship that worked for them.Deadly Harvest has dark and sinister undertones because of the subject matter. But I loved every word and didn't want it to end. This was my first Detective Kubu book, but certainly not my last. I have already added this series to the list of books that I'll read again and again and recommend to everyone I know. I'm so excited that I don't have to wait TOO long before I can read the next Detective Kubu book!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},

They make you feel safe. You trust them.But shouldyou…?Whenfifteen-year-old Billy Wilkinson goes missing in the middle of the night, hismother, Claire, blames herself. She's not the only one. There isn't a singlemember of Billy's family that doesn't feel guilty. But the Wilkinsons are soused to keeping secrets from one another that it isn't until six months later,after an appeal for information goes horribly wrong, that the truth begins tosurface.Claire issure of two things – that Billy is still alive and that her friends and familyhad nothing to do with his disappearance.A mother'sinstinct is never wrong. Or is it?Sometimesthose closest to us are the ones with the most to hide…My verdictUnlike many similarly-themed books around at the moment, The Missing concentrates on a missing teenager, rather than a young child. And this certainly provides a welcome change.The story begins six months after 15-year-old Billy disappeared. The family have no idea if he is still alive but haven't given up hope. C.L. Taylor certainly puts you right into the heart of the family, so you can feel the impact Billy's disappearance has had on the family unit. Claire, Billy's mother, keeps experiencing blackouts, brought on by stress. Her memory loss makes her completely unreliable, and as a reader it's very difficult to know who to trust.The Missing is more than simply a book about the search for a teenager. Other themes shining through include the psychological impact of tragedy and dark family secrets. As the book progresses, it's clear that Billy certainly isn't the 'golden child' that his mother wants everyone to believe, and that something has been bubbling under the surface.As the mother of two teenagers, The Missing certainly made me think and worry about my own children. I guessed the 'who dunnit' and the 'how dunnit' wasn't quite dark enough for me - but that probably says more about me than the book. Overall, The Missing is a compelling read, and a well-plotted psychological thriller, and it certainly kept me engrossed from beginning to end.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "A Divided Spy by Charles Cumming", "date": "Wednesday 8 June 2016", "text": "A Divided SpyBy Charles CummingPublished by HarperCollins (2 June 2016)ISBN: 978-0007467518Publisher's descriptionThomas Kellthought he was done with spying. A former MI6 officer, he devoted his life tothe Service, but it has left him with nothing but grief and a simmering angeragainst the Kremlin.Then Kellis offered an unexpected chance at revenge. Taking the law into his own hands,he embarks on a mission to recruit a top Russian spy who is in possession of aterrifying secret. As Kell tracks his man from Moscow to London, he findshimself in a high stakes game of cat and mouse in which it becomes increasinglydifficult to know who is playing whom.As themission reaches boiling point, the threat of a catastrophic terrorist attacklooms over Britain. Kell is faced with an impossible choice. Loyalty to MI6 –or to his own conscience?My verdictA Divided Spy is the third Thomas Kell novel, but the first Charles Cumming book I have read. So I read it as a standalone. The fact that I hadn't read the two previous books didn't detract from the main plot at all, although I do feel that I now need to read them to understand more about Kell's personal and professional background.Former MI6 agent Thomas Kell is torn between doing the right thing for his country and avenging the death of the woman he loved. Due to past events (I assume in previous books), he has no idea who to trust - even within his own circle. There are two main subplots within this book. The first focuses on Kell's mission to recruit a top Russian spy. The second focuses on a young Muslim man who has returned to the UK from Egypt. These two subplots are intricately woven together to culminate in a dramatic finale.A Divided Spy provides a fascinating insight into the world of espionage. It's an intriguing blend of love/relationships, terrorism, spies and counter-terrorism. There were plenty of twists and turns all the way through to the end. I particularly loved the London scenes, with their familiar streets, locations and landmarks, and found the characterisation to be strong, well-rounded and believable. The writing is so succinct, gripping and tense that I couldn't put the book down, reading most of it in one sitting.This book is ideal for fans of John le Carré and Ian Fleming and/or the TV series Spooks.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Lovereading."},
{"title": "Where Roses Never Die by Gunnar Staalesen - BLOG TOUR REVIEW", "date": "Tuesday 7 June 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the blog tour for Where Roses Never Die by Gunnar Staalesen, which was published in paperback by Orenda Books on 1 June 2016. Here's my review.Where Roses Never DieBy Gunnar StaalesenPublished by Orenda Books (Paperback - 1 June 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633090Publisher's descriptionSeptember 1977. Mette Misvær, a three-year-old girldisappears without trace from the sandpit outside her home. Her tiny, closemiddle-class community in the tranquil suburb of Nordas is devastated, buttheir enquiries and the police produce nothing. Curtains twitch, suspicions areraised, but Mette is never found. Almost 25 years later, as the expiry date forthe statute of limitations draws near, Mette’s mother approaches PI Varg Veum,in a last, desperate attempt to find out what happened to her daughter. As Veumstarts to dig, he uncovers an intricate web of secrets, lies and shockingevents that have been methodically concealed. When another brutal incidenttakes place, a pattern begins to emerge … Chilling, shocking and full ofextraordinary twists and turns, Where Roses Never Die reaffirms GunnarStaalesen as one of the world’s foremost thriller writers.My verdictSet in Norway in 2002, Where Roses Never Die is a slow burning private investigator novel. It's an intriguing and gripping read and darker than it initially appears.The book is set three years after the previous book, We Shall Inherit the Wind. Private investigator Varg Veum is struggling with his inner demons, turning to alcohol to get through each day and to escape his memories, until an unexpected visitor turns up at his door. A woman begs him to investigate the disappearance of her little girl 25 years earlier and Veum reluctantly takes on the case. Through his investigations, he discovers that the victim of a recent armed bank robbery lived in the same complex as the little girl. Could there be a link between the two?Gunnar Staalesen is a talented storyteller, bringing together various different subplots. Writing in the first person, he gets right into the heart of disturbed family dynamics and relationships. The complex dark and emotional side to his narrative and dialogue provides a window to Veum's own inner turmoil.Veum investigates crimes the old fashioned way - by interviewing people associated with the case, visiting scenes of the crime, asking questions, nosing into people's business and thinking everything through. He works alone and there's very little police procedural in the book - this is very much a 'one man show'.Where Roses Never Die isn't hailed with big fanfares or highlights of unexpected twists - yet the many twists, turns and red herrings kept me engrossed all the way through. The tension builds up gradually as secrets are revealed, yet the story moves quickly and I read it in just two sittings. It's cunningly plotted and kept me guessing right until the end, when I not only gasped but also shed a tear as all was revealed.A perfect choice for fans of Nordic Noir as well as intense chilling crime fiction.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Writing a Trilogy by Nikki Owen - author guest post for The Killing Files Blog Tour", "date": "Thursday 2 June 2016", "text": "I'm kicking off Nikki Owen's The Killing Files Blog Tour today. I'm delighted to welcome Nikki to my blog to talk about Writing a Trilogy. Her latest novel The Killing Files (the second part of The Project Trilogy) is published by Mira today (2 June 2016).Writing a Trilogyby Nikki OwenThe thing with writing a trilogy is it justnever leaves your head. It’s different to a standalone book. Standalone booksyou can, like a lover you’ve grown tired of, leave, walk away from, shut thedoor and never come back. But a trilogy? It’s like a lover you’ve had a childwith and so, no matter what you do, there’s always a connection, always a tugand a tie (but, thankfully, in a good way.)I never set out, initially, to write a trilogy.I’d read many of them, mainly YA: TheHunger Games, The Divergentseries, and (don’t judge me), um, The Twilightseries (oh, who am I kidding: I LOVED Twilight.FYI: I’m Team Edward.) Anyway, it wasn’t until I got writing what is now the Project trilogy that the concept of actuallywriting one myself began to become a real possibility. I’d read Stieg Larsson’sepic Millennium trilogy and admirednot only his amazing and original kick-ass heroine, Lisbeth Salander (which my protagonist,Dr Maria Martinez has been likened too), but truly was agog at his skill toplot, to create believable, 3-D characters and to go to a level of researched,intricate detail in the narrative that just blew my mind.  I read it and I thought to myself, ‘Nope. Ican’t do that.’ But, thing is, if myself or someone else tells me I can’t dosomething, or says, with grave reality, that I have no chance, then I am on it.I mean, seriously, I am a woman with a mission focused on proving everyonewrong. And so that’s how I found myself knee deepin a trilogy of my own, giving it a shot. Don’t get me wrong though – it’s beentough. The plotting alone messed with my head sometimes – the multiple storylines, the complex characters, the way I had to, through it all, ensure thatall the tiny details I described of Maria’s Asperger’s were accurate and true.I felt – quite rightly – a deep responsibility to the female Aspie community toget it spot on, to do them justice and represent them fairly, as real people,with real thoughts and emotions. The way I’ve planned the trilogy over the lasttwo/three years of writing has evolved. The first book was written with major penand notebook assistance (much like Maria’s notebook, funnily enough – she likesnotebooks A LOT). The second novel planning in the series I did in a moremethodical manner: a full on spreadsheet motherboard tracing every single plotline and character development for each scene. It worked to a point, but when Iforgot to look at it, my writing would go off piste – although this actually turnedout to be a good thing and created new ideas I hadn’t planned for. I’mfinishing book three of the trilogy now (no title as yet) and I think, finally,I have found my groove when it comes to planning. See, while I like to plan (Iused to be an advertising agency brand planner) I’m also a creative, and bycreative, I mean I daydream, and daydreaming often brings out ideas no amountof planning can predict. So I now find the best way that works for me is toplan a chapter, then write it, then plan the next one, then write it and so on.Especially with a huge, epic story arc of a trilogy, this method seems to fitmy brain best on balancing my planning gene with my wandering creative one. So there you go, writing a trilogy is alabour of love. And laughs. And (lots of) tears. A love that, despite its upsand downs, endures and stays in your head and, try as you might, never leaves.And that’s just the way I like it.

With the FBI putting pressure on him to secure the plea, Eddiemust find a way to prove Child's innocence while keeping his wife out of danger- not just from the FBI, but from the firm itself.My verdictI loved the first Eddie Flynn book, The Defence, so was very excited about reading The Plea. And it certainly lived up to my expectations.The Plea is a page-turning legal thriller, a mixture of an intelligent court room drama and tense non-stop action. This is crime fiction at its best and I struggled to put the book down from chapter one - when you first come across Eddie at the wrong end of a gun. The writing is fast-paced and entertaining. Cliffhangers at the end of each chapter enticed me to keep reading until the end.Eddie Flynn is a loveable rogue, a con man turned lawyer (although some people would say there's not much difference!). He has a good sense of morality, a big heart and plenty of determination to seek the truth and justice for those in the wrong. There are many surprises along the way, as he seeks to prove his client David Child is innocent of his girlfriend's murder, exposes corruption at the centre of a major New York law firm and is forced to protect his own family from the FBI and the firm itself.Steve Cavanagh is a talented writer and his books are highly addictive. I'm looking forward to the next Eddie Flynn instalment.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

As he hatches his twisted plan for their fairy story ending, cananyone stop him before he creates the ultimate sacrifice to love?My verdictFlowers for the Dead is a very dark and twisted psychological thriller - just as I like them - with a real rogue as the main character.Adam is evil, manipulative and very creepy, yet is yearning to love and be loved (although in a warped way). Thanks to the book's switching between past and present, you learn how Adam has become the man he is today. This book tackles the whole issue of what creates a serial killer - is it nature or nurture?Barbara Copperthwaite writes in a very vivid and descriptive way. Flowers for the Dead is very well written and easy to read, but is a long book so certainly isn't a quick read. Every little detail of the characters' actions and thoughts are there on the page. This enables readers to get right inside the characters' heads and picture each scene very clearly, which adds to the chilling nature of the book.You know Adam is a serial killer from the outset, and you know the ending won't be good. The momentum builds up, as does the body count, but you just have to keep reading anyway. I found myself racing to the end. Would Adam find true love and mend his ways? Or would he get his comeuppence? And more importantly, does he deserve his destiny or fate?I received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Quantrill Talks: The Dead Can't Talk - Hull: From Crap Town to City of Culture", "date": "Friday 27 May 2016", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Nick Quantrill to my blog today to talk about Hull: From Crap Town to City of Culture. His latest novel The Dead Can't Talk was published by Caffeine Nights Publishing on 12 May 2016.Hull: From Crap Town to City of Cultureby Nick QuantrillWhen Hull was voted the country’s top ‘Crap Town’ in 2003, itreally had sunk to its lowest point. Rather than sulk, my home city simplydusted itself down and readied to change things. Why not aim to become the nextUK City of Culture instead? But how does a much-maligned northern port do that?It’s something that’s both internal and external. The city’s confidence was on the rise after ‘Crap Town’; thenewly built Kingston Communications Stadium was the catalyst for Hull CityAFC’s march to the Premier League. The Deep, a large aquarium, a rare successfor the National Lottery’s Millennium project, helped reposition the city as atourist destination. Something was brewing. Such a process needed brains and acrack team was put in place, the bidding process taken deadly seriously. Fastforward to November 2013 and Hull had seen off challenges from Dundee,Leicester and Swansea Bay to be awarded the 2017 UK City of Culture title.My Joe Geraghty trilogy chronicled the change, even though Ihad no idea what was coming. Broken Dreams very much has the feel of the cityat its lowest. It deals with the trickledown effect of the loss of heavyindustry and asks what people do once work is taken away from them. The LateGreats examined the nature of a city isolated on the north east coast,marching to the beat of its own drum, but The Crooked Beat was moreoptimistic in tone, the city buoyant with news of green technology and cultureoffering a newly imagine future.Thewinds of change made me conclude I needed some fresh eyes to see what these newchanges will bring. Joe Geraghty is a Private Investigator, so certain doors inthe city are closed to him. In The Dead Can’t Talk, the story is told throughthe eyes of Anna Stone, a disillusioned Detective Constable with HumbersidePolice, and Luke Carver, a drifter freshly out of prison. They have thepotential to reach all of the city, the good and the bad, as they’re broughttogether by Stone’s missing sister.In The Dead Can’t Talk, the build-up to the City of Culture celebrations is inthe background, much like it was as it was written. The novel I’m working onnow will delve into the city’s nightlife and will contain the sights, soundsand smells of the celebrations. It’ll also contain murder, corruption andmoney. Which is only right for a crime novel. I don’t know what will happen, but it’s something I’ll beexamining in future work. Hull remains a somewhat maligned place, mainlybecause you need a reason to visit. You don’t simply pass through Hull as youhead elsewhere. It remains a mystery to many people, yet has its own spirit. Ofcourse, you shouldn’t just take my word for it. Come and visit in 2017 and seefor yourself what it’s like.About Nick QuantrillNickQuantrill was born and raised in Hull.

{"title": "See How They Run by Tom Bale", "date": "Wednesday 25 May 2016", "text": "See How They RunBy Tom BalePublished by Bookouture (6 May 2016)Publisher's descriptionIn the deadof night, new parents Alice and Harry French are plunged into theirworst nightmare when they wake to find masked men in their bedroom. Menruthless enough to threaten their baby daughter, Evie. This is noburglary gone wrong. Theintruders know who they’re looking for – a man called Edward Renshaw. And theyare prepared to kill to get to him. When themen leave empty handed, little do Alice and Harry realise that their nightmareis just beginning. Is it a case of mistaken identity? Who is Renshaw? And whatis he hiding? Onething is clear – they already know too much. As Aliceand Harry are separated in the run for their lives, there is no time forbreathe in their fight to be reunited. And with their attackers closing in,there is only a choice:STAYALIVE. OR DON’T.My verdictSee How They Run is so fast paced that at times I struggled to catch my breath! The constant action reminded me of Claire Seeber's 24 Hours, which is also published by Bookouture.The book takes an ordinary family and sticks them in a very extraordinary situation to see how they would cope and react. It made me wonder what I would do if something similar happened to me. Imagine waking in the night to discover two strangers in your bedroom - and they threaten not only you, but also your baby. Because they believe you have something of theirs - even though you don't. That's when Alice and Harry's nightmare begins.The book is basically non-stop rollercoaster action, with plenty of twists and turns and cat and mouse chases.  The plot moves very very quickly (sometimes a bit too quickly for me), making the book an easy read. The storyline isn't believable at all times, but it's certainly entertaining. Adding a baby into the mix enhanced the plot, as Alice's main focus was protecting her daughter, although there were lots of nappy changes involved. I was surprised that Alice took some of the risks in the first place - certainly a brave woman!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

There you are, writing it over several months, nourishing it, worryingabout it, then pushing it out into the world, fearful things will go horriblywrong. So it was with my first book, The Bad Things. When it appeared on mykindle last August on publication day I expected to feel euphoric. I’d done it!But the overwhelming emotion was worry. Would people like it? After all, thatwas the main reason for this whole rocky journey (not to be too X Factor aboutit) – to have people enjoy reading the book. My best friend rang me in theevening. I burst into tears. Overwhelmed. Then I drank champagne (my agent toldme to celebrate every stage with champagne. I took her at her word. Still do).As the days and weeks went on, people did read it and enjoyed it. Friends andcolleagues were so proud of me and for me – they knew I had wanted this forsome time. The reviews were great. I was determined not to obsess about theslightest critical word in a review (there is one reviewer who is a swear wordin our house). It did really well in various the kindle charts in the UK andthe US. I was a proper author. Then I held the paperback in my hand.Photographed it a lot. Tweeted and Face-booked until my head was spinning.And I wasn’t going to have second book dread. Absolutelynot. No way. What do you take me for? Worry about doing it all over again? Comeon! Okay, so I’d had months, years of preparing for my first book. I could sitand dream and think about accepting awards, of being on panels of being able todo what I had always wanted to do. Now I could begin to think about the nextone –‘You are writing the second one?’ (My agent.)‘Er…yes.’ (Me, looking at the doodles in my notebook.)‘Because you can’t hang around, you know. This is what youdo.’   (My agent – not known as The Fearsome One fornothing)So I tried not to hang around. I chatted to the dog (shealways listens, though occasionally appears bored). I sat my bottom in front ofmy computer (only way and if you’re not careful it can get quite large) andbegan to shape the doodles into words. Sentences. Paragraphs. Chapters. A book.After She Fell. The main characterthe same as in The Bad Things as I felt there was more of her story to tell –though I did move her out of her home town of Sole Bay to avoid it becominglike Midsomer with bodies everywhere. But.Are the characters just standing around drinking coffee?Do they spend most of their time in the pub?Does anything actually happen?What if I’ve lost the ability to write?What if nobody likes it? What if it doesn’t sell as well?Is it as good as The Bad Things?Do I have enough gin in the house? My agent loved it. My editor wanted it. After some more shapingand honing and polishing, it was pushed out into the world too.I had a fabulous publication day. Went out to lunch with myhusband. Drank champagne in the evening. Didn’t cry this time, I knew what toexpect. And yet. And yet. It was like having a second baby. First baby gets showeredwith teddy bears and rattles and cute clothes. Second baby gets a pair ofbootees. Knitted by a maiden aunt. Friends and colleagues made appreciativenoises and have, I hope, bought it. My family are still extremely proud of methough I do accept it’s not as exciting for them this time round. The goodreviews are beginning to appear, though I have weaned myself off refreshing theAmazon/Kobo/iBooks/Goodreads page every few minutes (it’s a wonder I writeanything). But still the doubts, the worry. See? Like having babies. But that’slife. And I am privileged to be able to do this, so damn lucky to have theopportunity a great many people dream of.The phone rings. It’s my friend – the one who I cried downthe phone to last August.‘Well done,’ she says. ‘I’m so proud of you.’‘But I don’t know whether it’s going to be as good… do aswell…’‘I am very proud of you,’ she says firmly. ‘You have writtenand published two books.

It remains the simplest and yet most profound thing I’ve ever learnedabout the law. Clients and witnesses go to court to (hopefully) tell the truth.In the course of my career I’ve seen witnesses approach the task of testifyingwith a sense of relish. They are not nervous at all: they know they are right,that their version of events is truthful and honest and exactly how ithappened. Inevitably, they go down in flames. Their story, irrespective of itstruth, may not in fact be the BEST story. Their perfect recollection isquestioned, prodded, pulled apart and dissected in minute detail. Before theyknow what’s hit them, an inconsistency appears.                   “Mr.Bloggs, in your statement to police, at the scene of the accident, you statedthat the traffic light was red. In your evidence to this court today, youstated that the light was amber, thenit turned red…”The slightest deviation from a previousstatement by any witness is ruthlessly exploited and treated not as a lapse ofmemory, but as a dagger through the heart of their credibility. It is the triallawyer’s job not only to produce a good story to the court, but to destroy hisopponent’s story in the process. I suppose that having the kind of mind that isable to pull narratives apart does lend itself to editing. A trial is conflict. There is a loser, anda victor. One story will be declared the best, and the verdict follows. Similarly,you can’t create drama on the page without conflict. My skills as a lawyer probably derive fromstorytelling. I’m Irish, so I grew up in a house full of people that told andread stories all day long. I knew what a good story sounded like and it gave mean advantage in my career as a lawyer. Sure, I went to University, and did mypost graduate stuff alongside my apprenticeship, but I didn’t learn anythingthat was of any use in my legal career. Knowing the law is not too difficult.It’s knowing how to apply it, and when necessary how to change it. The onlyother thing that I cling to in my legal career is a healthy disrespect for thelaw. There is such a thing as bad law. And bad laws can be manipulated.I would never draw upon real cases thatI’ve handled and allow that to feed my writing. That just wouldn’t be right.Has law helped my writing? It certainly helps when you’re writing legalthrillers, but my abilities as a storyteller probably help my career as alawyer more. There have been many great lawyers andwriters. John Mortimer, the creator of Rumpole of the Bailey, immediatelysprings to mind. For many years he was able to balance writing and legalpractice, and I’m doing the same at the moment. The only other lawyer andwriter that I know of is Scott Turow. He continues to practice and produce anew novel every few years. I don’t mind telling you, it’s tough. But I wouldn’tpursue these careers if I didn’t enjoy them. I know that when John Grisham hitthe big time with his second novel, The Firm, he said he left his law officesso fast he didn’t even stop to turn the lights off. In fairness, I suppose hecould afford a large electric bill at that stage. In fairness, he couldprobably buy the electricity company. At the moment I’m enjoying both careers. Asa lawyer I get to help people during the day, and as a writer I make up storiesat night. Just as long as I can keep doing that, in that order, I think it’llall work out in the end. The moment I start making stories up during theday…well, let’s not go there. About Steve CavanaghSteve was born and raised in Belfast,Northern Ireland, and is a qualified solicitor.

{"title": "The Evolution of Fear by Paul E. Hardisty - BLOG TOUR REVIEW", "date": "Wednesday 18 May 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Paul E. Hardisty's The Evolution of Fear, which was published in paperback on 5th May 2016 by Orenda Books.The Evolution of FearBy Paul E. HardistyPublished by Orenda Books (5 May 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633243Publisher's descriptionClaymore Strakeris a fugitive with a price on his head. Wanted by the CIA for acts of terrorismhe did not commit, his best friend has just been murdered and Rania, the womanhe loves, has disappeared. Betrayed by those closest to him, he must flee thesanctuary of his safe house in Cornwall and track her down. As his pursuersclose in, Clay follows Rania to Istanbul and then to Cyprus, where he is drawninto a violent struggle between the Russian mafia, Greek Cypriot extremists,and Turkish developers cashing in on the tourism boom. As the island of lovedescends into chaos, and the horrific truth is unveiled, Clay must call onevery ounce of skill and endurance to save Rania and put an end to theunimaginable destruction being wrought in the name of profit. Gripping,exhilarating and, above all, frighteningly realistic, The Evolution of Fear isa startling, eye-opening read that demands the question: How much is truth, andhow much is fiction?My verdictI loved Paul E. Hardisty's first book, The Abrupt Physics of Dying, when I read it last year. Often when you enjoy a book that much, you worry the second in the series won't do it justice. That dreaded 'second book syndrome'. But, actually, The Evolution of Fear is another stunning read. You could probably read it as a standalone. But I would still suggest buying The Abrupt Physics of Dying first - why read one amazing book, when you can read two?The Evolution of Fear overlaps genres, as do many of the amazing books from Orenda, which means they'll appeal to a wide range of readers.Firstly, The Evolution of Fear is an intelligent gripping action thriller. The book starts off in Cornwall, where Claymore Straker is lying low in an isolated location and recovering from his wounds (not just physical ones). But it doesn't take long for trouble to arrive at his door and for the action to begin. A fast-paced cat and mouse chase takes place across the Cornwall coastline. And that's just in the first few chapters. The complex plot soon leads Clay to Cyprus and Turkey in search of journalist Rania (the woman he loves). There are various factions who want to see the end of Clay and Rania and he isn't sure who to trust. The action keeps on coming and I read the last few chapters with bated breath. The tension builds up to some explosive action-packed final scenes.Secondly, The Evolution of Fear is a thriller of the modern age, tackling some key topical environmental issues. Turtles are being deliberately driven away from their breeding ground so that tourist resorts can be built there. I find the background to these books just as fascinating as the plot and characters. Paul E. Hardisty writes with such fervour that it's clear he feels just strongly about this issue as his characters do. He also weaves significant emotion into his writing. Clay is a strong lead with a caring heart and strict morals. Fear is definitely a key theme of the book - how it leads you to act in a certain way, whether it's to protect yourself or the ones you love, and how it can be used to manipulate others. Sometimes the only way to deal with stressful situations is to embrace the adrenaline rush that fear creates - and this is how Clay lives from day to day.Thirdly, The Evolution of Fear is literary fiction too, with beautifully written prose and vivid imagery of the stunning settings interspersed with the full-on action scenes. The descriptive passages are so carefully crafted that they're a pleasure to read in themselves. This is something you don't find in many other books within the action thriller genre, which is why The Evolution of Fear stands out.I'm looking forward to reading the third book in the series - to find out what's next in store for Claymore Straker. And to discover more of Paul E. Hardisty's beautiful writing.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.You can read my review of The Abrupt Physics of Dying here.Follow the Blog Tour:"},
{"title": "5 Tips for Aspiring Novelists by Mary Kubica - for her Don't You Cry blog tour.", "date": "Monday 16 May 2016", "text": "Today I'm kicking off the blog tour for Don't You Cry by Mary Kubica. I'm delighted to welcome Mary to my blog today with her 5 Tips for Aspiring Authors. Don't You Cry is being published by MIRA in e-book on 17 May 2016 and hardback on 19 May 2016.5 Tips for Aspiring Authorsby Mary KubicaWriting a book can easily be a dauntingtask.  It isn’t something that’s quickly achievedin a few days or weeks, but takes months or years to accomplish.  It can feel overwhelming and impossible attimes, but here are a few tips that I try to incorporate into my own writing tohelp turn an idea into a novel.1. If you don’t have all the building blocksof your novel fully plotted out in advance, that’s perfectly alright.  It’s rare that I know how my novels will end,and because I don’t outline before I begin writing, I’m typically well throughthe manuscript before I dream up the big twist. Many writers are discouraged because they had an idea but don’t know howit will resolve.  Don’t let this preventyou from getting your idea down on paper. You have hundreds of pages and thousands of words to figure it out.2. Take your manuscript one scene at atime.  If considering the big picturefeels too overwhelming (which, often times it does even for seasoned authors),then focus on one chapter or scene at a time. Know what you want to accomplish in that moment before dwelling on whatcomes next.  By breaking the process downinto smaller segments, it begins to feel more doable and less of a formidabletask.3. Truly love and care about yourcharacters.  They don’t have to belikeable people per se, but you’re going to be spending a lot of time withthem, whether you’re actively writing or plotting your novel out in yourhead.  Make sure these are people you’dlike to spend the next many months or years with.  Give them redeemable qualities and be sure thatthey’re multi-dimensional. The more human you make them, the more they willresonate, so your readers will enjoy their company for the length of yournovel.4. I’ve learned the hard way that if yourmanuscript is fighting you every step of the way, maybe it isn’t the rightproject for you.  I’ve abandoned a fullycompleted manuscript because I felt it fell short of my own and my readers’expectations, and in hindsight knew this early on in the process but was toostubborn to give up.  It’s perfectly okayto let go of one project and move onto something new if the characters or thestoryline aren’t driving you.  Trust yourinstincts, and know when to fight for a work-in-progress and when to give itup.  Sometimes a clean slate is the bestremedy for writer’s block.5. Be open to editing.  Rely on trusted family members or friends toread your manuscript and give feedback. Sometimes an outsider’s perspective is vital to discovering theshortcomings of your book.  But most ofall, love the process.About Mary KubicaMary Kubica is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of THE GOOD GIRL and PRETTY BABY.  She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in History and American Literature, and lives outside of Chicago with her husband and two children, where she enjoys photography, gardening and caring for the animals at a local shelter.  Her first novel THE GOOD GIRL received a Strand Critics Nomination for Best First Novel and was a nominee in the Goodreads Choice Awards in Debut Goodreads Author and in Mystery & Thriller for 2014.  She is currently working on her next novel.Readers can find out more about Mary on her website and follow Mary on Twitter - @MaryKubica Don't You CryBy Mary KubicaPublished by MIRA (17 May 2016)ISBN: 978-1848454767Publisher's descriptionIn downtown Chicago, a young woman namedEsther Vaughan disappears from her apartment without a trace.

{"title": "Digging into Darkness - a Q&A with author David Jackson", "date": "Thursday 12 May 2016", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome David Jackson to my blog today as my Author in the Spotlight. David Jackson's latest book A Tapping at My Door was published by Zaffre on 7 April 2016.Digging into DarknessA Q&A with David JacksonYou put the reader intothe mind of a serial killer and let them view events through a killer’seyes.  Do you find it easy to write these scenes and unleash a fury on theunsuspecting victims?   I’d be lying if I told you that I didn’t enjoy writing such scenes.I love them, and I think most other crime writers find it one of the mostenjoyable parts of the job. I think it was Hitchcock who said that greatvillains make for great drama, and I certainly wouldn’t disagree. At the sametime, it has to be remembered that baddies don’t think of themselves as bad:they don’t wake up in the morning rubbing their hands together andcontemplating world domination. In many ways they are often just normal people,and so writing from their points of view is also a way of exploring the darkestparts of our own minds. It would be fascinatingto know how you decide where to draw the line (in descriptive scenes ofviolence and also when settling on how a character takes the life ofanother).  I think it’s entirely down to intuition – what I think works andwhat doesn’t. Violence is undeniably horrific, and so I try to inject a bit ofthat horror into my writing; but at the same time there is the danger that toomuch gore will become tedious or off-putting. Somewhere between those twoextremes is where I draw my own line, but for other writers it will be in anentirely different place. For many bloggers, reading crime fiction is an escape, a chance to switch off from the real world andenjoy fictional retreats. Is there a danger that authors bring too much realityinto their stories meaning that the lines between fact and fiction becomesblurred and that escapism element could be lost? My view is that the vast majority of crime writing is unrealistic.In fact, I’d go further and say that the majority of any compelling fiction isunrealistic. And that’s a good thing. That’s why we read fiction – to escapethe tedium and humdrum nature of our existence. Show me a realistic crimenovel, and I’ll show you a boring one. Fictional people are not like realpeople. They are exceptional in some way, and exceptional things happen tothem. That’s what makes the stories about them exciting. Why do you think readerslike a serial killer story? One reason is that someone who has killed multiple times has, bydefinition, escaped capture multiple times. That makes them a worthy opponent,and, as mentioned above, a great villain makes for great drama. Secondly, it ups the body count. That means more conflict, not onlybetween the killer and victim, but also between killer and police. Every writerknows that conflict is what draws the reader in. Find out more about David JacksonReaders can find out more about David Jackson on his website.

{"title": "From non-fiction to fiction - a guest post by Douglas Skelton", "date": "Wednesday 11 May 2016", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Douglas Skelton to my blog today. Douglas' latest book Open Wounds, the final Davie McCall thriller, is published by Luath Press.From non-fiction to fictionby Douglas SkeltonBefore I became a best-selling crime fiction author, belovedby millions and an object of desire for women across the globe – not to mentionan inveterate liar – I had another life.I wrote non-fiction.Specifically, I wrote true crime.So, I hear you ask, how and why did you make the leap tofiction? At least, I hope you’re asking that. Otherwise I’m prattling to myselfhere.I was, at one time, a journalist. I’m not ashamed of it. Theclosest I ever came to hacking was being subjected to a young woman’s Facetimeconversation on a train. That was fascinating. She said she needed a breakbecause she’s been working ‘so hard for so long’. She was about 12. That led me to writing 11 true crime and criminal historybooks between 1992 and 2009. The first was ‘Blood on the Thistle’, which waslater dramatized for the talking theatre, don’t you know. That was a curiousexperience.The final one was ‘Glasgow’s Black Heart’, a history of thecity’s underworld. That’s not been dramatized by anyone.Once that mighty tome was complete, I realised I’d donealmost everything in the genre I wanted. It was time for me to seek out newchallenges. Fiction beckoned like a wicked witch offering a rosy, redapple.It took me four years to have my first novel accepted. Thatwas ‘Blood City’, the first in the Davie McCall quartet. ‘Crow Bait’ and‘Devil’s Knock’ swiftly followed.The fourth and final one in the series, OPEN WOUNDS, is outnow. I hope you buy it. So does my dog. She needs a new ball.So, I hear you ask (humour me), did the true crime helpinform the fiction?Well, yes, to an extent. It gave me a grounding in certainprocedures and crime in general. But for the Davie McCall books, another job camein darned handy.I investigated crime for some Glasgow solicitors. I wasn’texactly a private eye, the job description being precognition agent(precognition being a statement given to the defence ahead of a court case, butit is not admissible). However, there wasn’t a mean street down which I didn’twalk, my coat collar turned up, my hat pulled low, my mind set on justice and ashot of bourbon. OK, it was bourbon creams, maybe a Jaffa Cake, but you get thegist.I met a lot of people on both sides of the legal divide inthe course of that work. I learned a few things. All of it came in handy whencreating the twilight world of Davie McCall. It told me that often crime isn’tblack and white, no matter how much you like James Cagney films. It taught methat humour was important. It taught me that criminals can be family-minded,love their mothers, their dogs. It taught me that violence can be swift andunforgiving.Davie’s not a cop or a private eye or a reporter. He’s acriminal, a hard man, with his own set of values which he follows to theletter. Life has been tough for him. He’s lost people. He’s lost A LOT ofpeople.Now, in the final book of the series, he may well loseeverything.But as I said, my true crime/mean street walking past lifeonly informs the books. My life as a reporter taught me never to let the facts getin the ay of a good story, so I’m going more for believability than factualaccuracy. These are not documentary accounts of the underworld but thrillersdesigned to make you turn the page, to (hopefully, fingers and toes crossed)make you care about a man with a tragic past, battling his inner demons, a goodman walking in a bad man’s skin.If you’ve not read any of the books, I hope you will bedrawn to them. My dog also need a new collar.About Douglas SkeltonDouglas Skelton is a Scottish crimewriter who specialises in non-fiction and fiction from the darker side of ourworld.

He never came back.His wife,Gina, is struggling to deal with her loss, and her daughter’s mood swings aregetting worse. Then she receives a phone call from a woman at a country hotel,confirming details of a booking Rick made before he vanished. Desperateto find out more about his disappearance, Gina and her daughter take the trip.But there is something very strange about the hotel, and the family that runit. Soon Ginais unsure that Rick even made the booking – but one thing is clear: both motherand daughter are in serious danger.My verdictIn Too Deep is a gripping and highly addictive book that I read in one sitting.There seems to be a trend at the moment for 'disappearance' books, but In Too Deep focuses on a missing husband rather than a child. It begins four months after Rick disappeared (with no apparent reason), and wife Gina and daughter Hannah are still struggling to cope. When they discover Rick made a hotel booking before he vanished, Gina wonders whether this could provide some answers. So she and Hannah pack their bags for a weekend break. But this certainly isn't a 'holiday of a lifetime'  and they find more than they bargained for.I raced through In Too Deep, determined to discover what had happened to Rick, and had to keep telling myself to slow down. The tension builds up as Gina and Hannah slowly uncover more about the hotel and the family who run it. The book is well written and fast paced, with characters that I could relate to easily. I had to force myself to put the book down several times, just so I could take a breather and ease the tension in my shoulders. But that didn't last long as I had an urge to pick the book up again to keep reading. Not many books have that effect on me.The author kept me guessing all the way through. The various twists and turns meant I had no idea what had happened to Rick, even until the last few pages. And I'm sure I must have gasped out loud in several places. This is certainly a psychological thriller that I'll be recommending.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Did you follow the Blog Tour:"},

This book will remain with me for a long time, due to itsbeautiful intense writing and thought-provoking powerful plot.Girls on Fire is the story of two 17-year-old girls in a small town. Hannah Dexter leads a quiet life until she meets the town's bad girl Lacey. As she comes out of her shell, changing her name to Dex, her new best friend Lacey shows her the darker side of the teenage years.This is a fast-paced passionate book, narrated mainly by 'Dex' and Lacey. It isn't an easy read, but it's certainly an addictive one. Prepare to be amazed, totally engrossed and shocked as the book touches on disturbing issues such as drugs, bullying, suicide and satanism.Girls on Fire is likely to leave you feeling exhausted and emotionally drained. The author has the most amazing talent of describing EVERYTHING in the most vivid and hard-hitting language.

Grace Reavey, stricken bygrief, is accosted at her mother's funeral. Thethreat is simple: pay the staggering sum her mother allegedly owed, or loseeverything. Lucy Davies has been forced from the Met by her own maverickbehaviour. Desperate to prove herself in her new rural post, she's on the hunt for a killer - but this is no small towncriminal. Plunged into a conspiracy that will test each of them to theirlimits, these three strangers are brought together in their hunt for the truth,whatever it costs. And as their respective investigationsbecome further and further entwined, it becomes clear that at the centre ofthis tangled web is a threat more explosive than any of them could haveimagined.My verdictSpare Me the Truth is a gripping intelligent thriller covering conspiracy theories, spies, action and murder. It packs a lot into its 500+ pages, but certainly doesn't feel like it's a long read, as it's fast paced and well plotted.It's also highly addictive and a book that you will struggle to put down until you've read the final page. I was gripped from the prologue, and continued to be absorbed throughout. The plot is a fascinating one, especially the theme of memory loss and how memories can be easily manipulated.Spare Me the Truth is character-led as well as being plot-driven. There's Dan, who has such a mysterious past that he doesn't remember it - and soon discovers that his family can't be trusted to divulge the truth either. Which memories is he suppressing? And will his true memories ever return? There's Grace, a GP who realises her mother was leading a double life - and appears to owe a huge sum of money to some unsavoury people.  And then there's Lucy, a detective searching for a killer, who has her own demons to contend with. These characters'  intertwined threads tie up nicely at the end of the book.Spare Me the Truth is also well-researched - and it's quite frightening to think about the drugs and technology that's either already out there or at the Research & Development stage. It gives the book a slight science fiction feel too.This was my first C.J. Carver book, but it certainly won't be my last.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Sunset City by Melissa Ginsburg - book extract for Blog Tour", "date": "Wednesday 4 May 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Melissa Ginsburg's Sunset City, which was published by Faber on 21 April 2016. Below is an extract from the book. READ THE EXTRACTCHAPTER TWODetective Ash listened as I told him whathappened Sunday. Danielle’s mother Sally had called me that morning andinsisted that I come by her office. I was surprised to hear from her. I didn’teven know she had my number. But I heard the urgency in her voice and agreed tomeet. I was curious, I guess. That, and I had nothing else to do. It was my dayoff from the coffee shop where I worked, and I’d thought I’d spend it withMichael, but he wasn’t answering my texts.Sally always was hard to say no to. I droveto her office building, a glass tower that rose in the Houston sky. Sallystepped outside and waved. She was dressed in tailored shorts, low mules, and aprinted jersey blouse. Even in casual clothes she looked intimidating, rich.“Hi, Charlotte,” she said. “Thanks so muchfor stopping by.”“Sure,” I said. I had always felt awkwardaround Sally. “It’s no problem.”Our footsteps echoed over the polishedstone surfaces to a bank of elevators. We went to her floor and she led me pasta set of double doors, a reception desk, and a pair of leathercouches. On the wall hung a series ofphotographs depicting various stages of the Rice Hotel revitalization project.Years ago, downtown was a deserted wasteland after five o’clock. No onebelieved that people might live there or go there at night. Sally’s company hadpioneered the downtown gentrification, changed the city, and made millions. Nowurban lofts sprouted everywhere, even in the suburbs.The air-conditioning froze my sweat, andgoose bumps rose along my arms. We walked down the hall to her office. A hugewindow overlooked the building’s atrium, filled with large leafy plants, ferns,and birds of paradise. Filtered sunlight fell in patches on the sleek officefurniture. “Have a seat,” she said, indicating a pair of plush chairs. We eachtook one.“How are you, sweetie?” she said. “How’sschool going?” “I’m taking this semester off,” I said.“Taking a break.” “I wish Danielle had gone to college,”Sally said. “She never has done things the regular way.” “I guess not,” I said. “How is Danielle, anyhow?” She tried tosound casual. Soft lines showed around her eyes and mouth. “Good, I guess. We don’t really hang out.”Sally nodded. “I haven’t seen her since before she . . . left,” she said. Iignored Sally’s clumsy euphemism for prison. I wasn’t surprised Danielle hadstayed away from her. She and Sally had never been close.“Charlotte, I need her phone number.” “You don’t have it?” I said, surprised. “She changed it. I have the old one, fromwhen she was on my cell phone plan. We haven’t talked in a long time.” I did know how to get in touch withDanielle—we’d run into each other at a restaurant a couple of months back and exchangednumbers. But if Danielle wanted to avoid Sally, no way was I getting in themiddle of it. I frowned, looking out the window. So strange to see all thetropical plants growing indoors. It seemed backwards.“Charlotte, I know this puts you in anawkward position. But I really need your help. I need to get ahold of her. Myaunt died.”“Gosh,” I said. “I’m sorry.”“Well, she’d been ill a long time. Theproblem is, she left Danielle an inheritance. Now the probate lawyers need totalk to her, there’s paperwork to do, and she’s nowhere to be found. It’s a bitembarrassing.”She said this last in a whisper, leaningforward, conspiratorial.“Please help me,” she said. As she spokeshe slid a white envelope over to me.“What’s this?” I said. “Open it.” Inside the envelope was a sheaf ofhundred-dollar bills. I counted them twice—a thousand dollars. “I know you can use it,” Sally said. “Ijust need her phone number. Please.” There was no way I could pass up that muchmoney. I searched through my phone for Danielle’s number and read it off toSally.“Perfect, darling, thank you so much. I’llcall her tonight, as soon as I’m finished up here.”“Thank you,” I said. “For the money.”She stood. “Oh, sweetie. It’s been lovelyto see you. You get prettier and prettier. Can you find your way out?”“Yeah, sure,” I said. She hugged me goodbye, smothering me againin her expensive perfume, her aura of wealth and power. I hurried past thesmooth stone walls of the lobby and out to the parking lot, with its cleanpainted lines slanting in parallels. I sat in my hot car for a minute, lettingmy skin thaw before turning the ignition. I felt dazed by the heat and themoney in my pocket.I texted Danielle immediately. It’sCharlotte. Have to see you. It’s important. Drink? She texted me back and wemade plans to meet at six at a new bar called the Mockingbird.Later I drove through traffic to the bar,which occupied a corner strip mall on Westheimer, along with a dry cleaners,one window-broken vacancy, and an accountant’s office called Tax Mex. Inside Iignored the cheap specials and ordered Maker’s, rocks; I was rich. Danielle showed up late, when I was on mysecond drink. She was gorgeous, as always, but in a weird, doll- like way: longstreaked hair, too much makeup. Her tits looked bigger, fake.“Charlotte, wow,” she said. “It’s nice tosee you.” She gave me a half hug, kissed the air nearmy cheek.“You look great,” I said. “Thanks. So do you.” She ordered a peachmartini from the bartender and I gotanother whiskey. “So what’s going on?” she said. “Don’t get upset.” “Uh-oh, Charlotte, what?” “Your mom paid me a thousand dollars foryour phone number,” I said. “What?”“Yeah.” I handed her Sally’s envelope.“Here’s your half.”She opened the flap and thumbed through thebills. “You gave her my number?” she said.“Yeah. Because she gave me a thousanddollars.” “Does she want me to have this?” “She doesn’t know.” Danielle squinted at me. “Then why are yougiving it to me?” “I figured, worst-case scenario, you coulduse it to get a new phone. It felt weird to keep it and not warn you.” “Thanks.”“Free money, right? Why not.”She set the envelope on the bar andcentered her drink on top of it. A sticky pink ring dampened the paper.“Fucking Sally,” she said. “I know.” “She’s ridiculous.” “I know,” I said. “I would have given upyour digits for a lot less.” “Shut up,” Danielle said, laughing. “Has she called you yet?” “No. What does she want?” “She wants to tell you your great-auntdied.” “Aunt Baby? God, we used to go to her placewhen I was little. She lived out in Tomball.” “She left you something in her will. You’llhave to see the lawyer and sign papers, I guess.” “God, Sally and her lawyer? The worst.” “I’m sorry about your aunt.” Danielle shrugged. “I barely remember her.Still, it’s sad. Anyways. It’s great to see you. What have you been doing allthis time? I’m surprised we haven’t run into each other more.”“I guess I stay in the neighborhood a lot.I’ve been working at Common Grounds on Shepherd. The coffee shop.”“Oh, I know that place. I never go inthere. So what else? Are you seeing anybody?”I laughed. “All you care about is boys,” Isaid. “But yes, yeah, I have a boyfriend. He’s in a band, he’s nice, we’ve beentogether about a year.”“Is it serious?”“I don’t know, maybe. Kind of serious,yeah. How about you? How’ve you been?”She rested her hand on the edge of the bar.I’d forgotten her grace, her perfect posture. Her wrists were delicate andfreckled.“I’m doing okay. Good, actually. It reallyis nice to see you. I can finally have a chance to say thank you for yourletters.”I’d written to her in prison but neverheard back. “I wondered if you got them,” I said. “I got them. It was really nice of you.They cheered me up.” “Was it awful in there?” I asked. “I’m sosorry you had to go through all that.” “It was, yeah. I don’t want to talk aboutit. But it was good in some ways, too. I got clean. It’s been almost threeyears.” “That’s great. I’m so glad,” I said. “I wanted to write you back,” she said. “Itwas NA. They really pressure you to cut ties with the people you did drugswith. To make it easier to kick.”“It’s okay,” I said. “I mean, whateverhelps, right?” “Yeah.” We sipped our drinks for a minute. “So what else have you been up to?” I said.“Since you got out?” “First thing I did was go on a diet. I gotfat in there.”“You did not. I don’t believe it.”“It’s true!” Danielle said. “They gave usmashed potatoes every fucking day. I gained like five pounds.”“Oh no, five pounds.” I rolled my eyes. “Charlotte, listen. I’m glad you textedme.” “Well, of course. How could I not?”“No, I mean I missed you. A lot. I know Iscrewed things up.”“No more than me,” I said, flustered. “Youhad bad luck, getting caught. I’ve missed you, too.”“You’re so sweet,” she said, putting herarm around me.“We went through a lot of shit together.I’m glad you’re doing okay now.”“Me, too,” she said, turning to kiss me onthe cheek.A slim, dark-haired girl came up behind us.She looked about our age, mid-twenties, and pretty. Her lips twisted in a halfsmile.“Aww, you guys are adorable,” the girlsaid.“Audrey, hey,” Danielle said, letting go ofme. “Charlotte, this is my friend Audrey.”I felt both relieved and irritated at theinterruption. “Hi,” I said. “It’s nice to meet you.” “You, too,” Audrey said. “Charlotte is my oldest, dearest friend,”Danielle said. “We haven’t seen each other in ages. We have to catch up.” “How about a drink?” Audrey said. “Anotherround?” “Sure,” Danielle said. Audrey ordered whiskey, same as me. Thebartender brought our drinks, sloshing Danielle’s martini as he set it down.Danielle turned to me. “Did you hear about Joey?” she said. “No,” I said. “He got locked up. Out west. New Mexico, Ithink.”“Who’s Joey?” Audrey asked. “My boyfriend from before,” Danielle said.“We used to, when we’d fuck, we used to try to come at the same time, and rightat that second we would shoot each other up. I thought we’d get married. Inever had anything like that with anybody else.”“That’s insane,” Audrey said. “You’reinsane.” “I loved him,” Danielle said. “Fuck, Iloved him. We were so in love it was crazy.” “Are you serious?” Audrey said. “Yeah, that’s fucking crazy!” “We were fucking romantic,” Danielle said.She rubbed a mark on her French manicure. She was definitely getting tipsy.Showing off a little, too. I couldn’t tell if she was trying to impress me orAudrey. Maybe both of us.“Tell me,” I said, “how do y’all two knoweach other?” “From work,” Audrey said. “Don’t tell her,” Danielle said to Audrey. “Don’t tell me what?” I said.“Yeah, don’t tell her what?” Audrey said. “You’ll freak out,” Danielle said to me. “No, she won’t,” Audrey said. “You’re beingparanoid.” “Fine,” Danielle said. “There’s this guynamed Brandon, he works at the cable access channel, Mediasource. He’s a film-maker and he does programming and stuff. We work with him on private projects.We’re models.”“She’s so weird about it,” Audrey said.“We’re not models, but they call it modeling. It’s for a porn site. Videos.”“You’re porn stars?” “We’re not stars,” Danielle said. “Speak for yourself,” Audrey said. Shetossed her hair and pursed her lips, arching her back in a pinup pose. Ilaughed. “Wow,” I said. “How does it work? You fuckpeople and there’s a camera?” “See?” Danielle said to Audrey. “She’sfreaking out.”“I’m not freaking out,” I said. And Iwasn’t. I wasn’t even surprised. “What’s it like?” I asked Audrey. “It’s a job. It’s work. There’s a lot ofwaiting around, stopping and starting. The guys take forever. Or the Viagrawears off.” “Yeah,” Danielle said. “And you have to lookperfect no matter what.”“You have to try not to look bored,” Audreysaid. “Even though it’s really boring. Mostly, anyway.”“It’s easier than dancing,” Danielle said.“At least you always get paid.”“Plus Brandon’s nice,” Audrey said.“Yeah, he’s not a douche bag like you’dthink,” Danielle said. “He also makes art movies. He’s super talented.”“You should come to his screening,” Audreysaid. “He’s showing one of his experimental films next week. There’ll be areception. Free booze.”“Sounds cool,” I said. “What’s the websitecalled?” “Can we talk about something else, please?”Danielle said. “Come on,” I said. “SweetDreamz,” Audrey said. “With a Z.SweetDreamz.net.” “It’s a dumb name,” Danielle said. “So what?” Audrey said. “I am totally looking it up as soon as Iget home,” I said, teasing. “Come on, don’t,” Danielle said. “Oh my god,” I said. “I’m kidding, I’mkidding. I won’t.” “You should, though,” Audrey said.Danielle rolled her eyes. “Enough. We haveto go. We’re meeting people for dinner.” I wondered if she was running away from theconversation. I decided not to bring up her job next time we met. “Well, it’s great to see you,” I said. “Me, too,” Danielle said. “This was fun.I’ll see you at the screening?” “Sure,” I said. “Text me the details.” Audrey rose and smiled.“Bye,” she said. “It was nice meeting you.”Danielle got up, swinging her handbag ontoher shoulder. She left the envelope of cash on the bar.“Hey, you’re forgetting this,” I said,picking it up. It was soggy with condensation from her glass.“Keep it,” she said. “No. That’s nuts.” “I don’t need it. I don’t want anythingfrom her.” I recognized the tone she reserved forSally, full of contempt. I knew her well enough to let the subject drop. Inodded, put the envelope in my bag, and waved goodbye. At least I’d tried. Notthat I minded keeping the cash. Danielle was always weird about money. I guessit means something different when you grow up rich.Sunset CityBy Melissa GinsburgPublished by Faber (21 April 2016)ISBN: 978-0571326709Publisher's descriptionTwenty-two-year-old Charlotte Fordreconnects with Danielle, her best friend from high school, a few days beforeDanielle is found bludgeoned to death in a motel room.

When a woman isbrutally attacked on a lonely country road by an escaped inmate from a nearbypsychiatric hospital, Sergeant Davie Gray must track him down before he strikesagain. But Gray is already facing a series of deaths connected to legal highsand a local fairground, as well as dealing with his girlfriend Marie's bizarrebehaviour. As Gray investigates the crimes, he suspects a horrifying linkbetween Marie and the man on the run - but how can he confront her when she'spushing him away? As a terrified Marie is pulled back into a violent past shethought she'd escaped, she makes an irrevocable decision. And when events cometo a head at a house party on Willow Walk, can Gray piece together the puzzlein time to stop the sleepy town of Banktoun being rocked by tragedy once more?My verdictWillow Walk is a gripping read from start to finish. It begins with a terrifying incident at a party that really built up the tension straightaway and threw me straight into the plot. I could feel my skin prickling, and my pulse racing, as I read that first chapter, with its very vivid narrative.Willow Walk covers many themes. It's a story of running from the past, sibling love, legal highs and tragic events in the usually quiet town of Banktoun. I enjoyed Black Wood, Susi Holliday's first book. But with Willow Walk, she has definitely upped her game. Her characters are sharply developed, her plot slick and her writing concise. This is a fast-paced read, with fewer subplots than her previous novel.Willow Walk is creepy and tense and covers some highly emotive contemporary issues. It kept me intrigued all the way through.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "My 'One Woman' Twitter Campaigns - why?", "date": "Wednesday 27 April 2016", "text": "If you've been on Twitter over the last couple of weeks, you may have noticed my two 'One Woman' Twitter campaigns, encouraging people to:(1) 'not just buy bargain books' (2) 'review the books they love'I've had authors and publishers thank me for my tweets and a large number of comments and retweets. I appreciate every one of them. But that's not why I'm doing it. Good books are pricelessI LOVE reading. Always have done and always will. A good book can whisk you off to faraway places, introduce you to the wonders of the world (or other worlds) and enable you to meet a whole host of characters (good and bad). It can make you smile, laugh, cry, think, contemplate, shake, gasp ... a well-written book can trigger so many emotions. If a book's THAT GOOD, you'll want to read it again and again. So why just stick to the bargains? Look around Amazon, visit your local bookshop, local library, follow #BookLove on Twitter to see ALL the fabulous books out there, not just the cheap ones or the free ones. People don't think twice about paying for a coffee that lasts a few minutes. Books can last a lifetime. Choose books because they sound FANTASTIC, not based on their price.Authors spend months, sometimes years, writing - and re-writing - their books. Their blood, sweat, tears and heartache fill those pages. They've deliberated over every word. Created characters that you can believe in. Developed stories that will wow you - and will last forever. A beautifully-written book really is priceless.  So why not splash out? There are so many brilliant books available. It's just a case of finding them. Which brings me on to my other 'campaign'.#WriteAReview - Review the books you loveIf you love a book that much, you'll want the world to know. Help the author out by telling your friends, family, Twitter pals, Facebook friends... even people in the street. And don't forget to leave a review on Amazon, Goodreads and other websites/online book clubs. If you don't tell people about the books you love, no one else will find them. Books often only get promoted on Amazon (i.e. picked up by the algorithms) if they have enough good reviews. Which means fantastic books may not get near the top of the charts. Most people only look at the top charts when they're choosing a book, or just choose bargain, reduced price or free books.Anyone can write a review - you don't need to be a book blogger. Just a few words will do. Write from the heart.Even if you don't like a book, you can still leave a review. But remember that authors are people too - with real feelings!So this is why I've started my two Twitter campaigns. I have no idea whether anyone is listening or taking notice. But these are both #BookLove issues that I feel strongly about. #WriteAReview#GoodBooksArePriceless"},

Divided by language, lifestyle and personality yet all driven by painfulmemories buried in their pasts, the three women unite to search for the missingchild. It’s a quest that takes them deep into the city’s underworld, wherepoverty is rife, black magic thrives and violence is king; a world in whichappearances can be deceptive and where survival is by no means certain.My verdictThe Other Side of the Mountain is the story of three very different women who meet in Haiti at a time of political turmoil. It's a passionate and heart-wrenching book that's beautifully written and not easy to forget.Young farmer Yolanda is hiding from an abusive husband. Maddy is seeking the ideal story that will further her career as a journalist. And Clare, a gynaecologist, is helping to heal Haiti's women. All are escaping their past in some way. Their search for a missing girl (Yolanda's younger sister) brings the three women together - and helps them overcome their personal challenges and fears.The Other Side of the Mountain is a fascinating story with sad undertones, set in a country of poverty, destruction and violence. The tiny details, vivid descriptions and rich dialogue within the narrative are truly stunning and transported me to Haiti, with its sounds, aromas and sights. Fiona Cane is an amazing writer and storyteller. The story of these three women really touched me, especially as some of the events are based on real life.This is certainly a book I'll be recommending!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

I even visited the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Portsmouth soon after I finished reading Tenacity and told everyone on the tour that they should buy the book. At the time, we were in an enclosed space and no one couldn't escape easily - so I reckoned this was the ideal opportunity to do some book promotion.A Bloody War or a Sickly Seasonby James LawIf you’ve followed my blog tour at all, you’ll know that atmess dinners in the Royal Navy, immediately after the Loyal Toast of ‘TheQueen’, the youngest officer present will normally offer the traditional drinking toast of that day.‘A Bloody War or a Sickly Season’ refers to the will for agood old dust up to thin the ranks, or a spell of illness and associateddeaths, to allow for quicker promotion and advancement through the ranks. Ilike this toast because it’s so damn honest! It’s also one of the toasts thatactually appears in the book, thought it's misused, said to Dan as 'A bloody whore with a sickly lesion'.Unfortunately, this is just one of the instances when Dan issubjected to a frightening situation, but the toast holds true in its intent –the speaker is wishing harm upon Dan to his own ends, but Dan’s unlikely tostep aside easily and today, Tenacity finally sets sail, so you can find outexactly how far the other sailors will go to stop her…About James LawJames joined the Royal Navy in 1993 as anapprentice and went on to serve for twenty years, the majority spent in theSubmarine Service. He rose through the ranks, taking a commission as anengineering officer in 2001, and serving as a Senior Engineer and NuclearReactor Plant Supervisor, where his responsibilities ranged from the safety andoperation of the submarine’s nuclear power plant to hydraulic plants, fridgesand toilets; it was the latter of these tasks that brought the majority of anypressure.His final years in service were spenttraining future submariners in the role of Senior Lecturer in Nuclear ReactorEngineering, where he lectured and mentored future submarine operators of allranks and rates.Having written short stories and novelsthroughout his naval career, James completed an MA in Creative Writing atPortsmouth University shortly before leaving the navy in 2013, completing hisdebut novel, Tenacity, shortly afterwards.James lives in Hampshire with his wife,Elaine, and two children.

{"title": "Lindsey Davis: Veni, Vidi, Vici - Dialogue in Historical Fiction", "date": "Wednesday 20 April 2016", "text": "I'm delighted to welcome Lindsey Davis to my blog today. Lindsey's latest Flavia Albia novel, The Graveyard of the Hesperides (Flavia Albia 4), was published by Hodder & Stoughton on 14 April 2016.I loved all 20 books in Lindsey Davis's Falco series - I remember taking the 9th book (Three Hands in the Fountain) on my honeymoon in 1997!  Although I'm currently lagging behind with her latest series - featuring Falco's adopted daughter Flavia Albia - I'm definitely turning into an ardent fan of these books too.Recently I put the following questions to Lindsey:You write dialogue in today’s language. Why, as you are so historically accurate, do you give your characters today’s attitudes? Does it bring in readers who wouldn’t usually read historical fiction? How important is humour in your writing, especially in relation to your dialogue? Read below to discover her answers.Dialogue in Historical Fictionby Lindsey DavisWell, I am loth to be too stroppy but Idisagree. I don’t think my characters have today’s attitudes – or no more thanthe Romans really did (read Senecca, for example, on gladiators, read Cicero’sbrother on how to get elected, which was the spin-doctoring tract behind DeadlyElection, read any of the Roman satirists on trying to be a writer when nobodythinks they need to pay you for your work, read Ovid on sex…). Both Falco andAlbia frequently muse on the idea of Romanness, its traditions and myths, itsgood and its bad points as they affect people and society. Falco is a proper Roman,even though he pretends he’s critical, and Albia is giving us the woman’s andthe outsider’s viewpoint; she comes from Britain so she views the city as aforeigner might. On language specifically, if I was entirelyaccurate I’d be writing in Latin, and a street-level kind at that. (What do yousuppose the Roman version is of the “Thou art a varlet, sirrah, quoth he” styleof historical writing?...) I choose modern idioms, while trying not to beanachronistic. People don’t get mesmerized, they are fascinated or struck dumb.They don’t say Oh my God, they mutter Titan’s turds! I invent swear words (andothers – but Shakespeare did that, all the time). There is a fine movement inAustralia to bring my ‘nicknackaroony bowls’ into current parlance. I would onlyuse ‘parlance’ in a particularly mannered passage, incidentally, perhaps whenbeing ironical. It’s all a question of selection. So long as whatever you sayis clear in context, that is the only thing that matters. I can be accused of being too English, tooAmerican, too slangy, too formal (I know how use clauses), or just too modern.The Microsoft grammar checker (which I turn on just so I can shout it down)thinks I use too many unfinished phrases. Its use of verbs does not comply withmine. People who think that way should just go and read a more pedestrian,‘safe’ author instead.

{"title": "When She Was Bad by Tammy Cohen", "date": "Tuesday 19 April 2016", "text": "When She Was BadBy Tammy CohenPublished by Transworld (21 April 2016)ISBN: 978-1784160197Publisher's descriptionYOU SEE THEPEOPLE YOU WORK WITH EVERY DAY.BUT WHATCAN'T YOU SEE?Amira,Sarah, Paula, Ewan and Charlie have worked together for years - they know how eachone likes their coffee, whose love life is a mess, whose children keep them upat night. But their comfortable routine life is suddenly shattered when anaggressive new boss walks in ....Now,there's something chilling in the air.Whosecretly hates everyone?Who istortured by their past?Who iscapable of murder?My verdictWow - Tammy Cohen has a very twisted mind. When She Was Bad kept me guessing from start to finish. It's a dark and creepy page-turner that will leave you reeling and make your spine tingle. Tammy Cohen has an amazing knack of getting right inside her characters' heads - these ordinary people seem so normal on the surface yet anything could be bubbling under the surface.The book begins with a brutal killing and only one person - a child psychologist called Dr Anne Cater - seems to know the culprit. Through a series of flashbacks dotted around the book, Dr Cater recounts a tragic and harrowing story of child abuse.The main plot concentrates on a group of work colleagues, all with something to hide. None are particularly likeable but all are very believable. Their new boss is rattling some cages, pitting one colleague against another and bringing their secrets to the surface. This is a 'slightly' exaggerated scenario as it's a work of fiction, but this is exactly why I'm so relieved that I don't work in an office environment any more, with all the office politics to contend with. The narrative switches between the different characters and played with my head so much that I had no idea who the culprit was - or how the book would end.I love Tammy Cohen's books, and I reckon this is her best so far - certainly her most disturbing. A fantastic read that I couldn't put it down. Thinking about it gives me goosebumps, and not many books do that!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley and Lovereading.Click here for the Lovereading reviews."},
{"title": "The Missing Hours by Emma Kavanagh - Blog Tour guest post", "date": "Monday 18 April 2016", "text": "It's my stop on the blog tour for The Missing Hours by Emma Kavanagh. I'm delighted to welcome Emma to my blog today. The Missing Hours is being published by Cornerstone on 21 April 2016.Book 3…Shouldn’t I have a grip on this by now?by Emma KavanaghIt is a dream, this job. Seriously. I getto make stuff up for a living. My brain can wander anywhere it wants to.Sometimes it even comes back. Ha! I jest. What was I saying…Oh, right. When people ask me what I do, Imutter the word ‘author’ in an undertone, much the way one would say the words ‘drugdealer’. Because this is SUCH an awesome job, that I don’t want to appear cockyabout it, don’t want the gods of fate looking down at me and saying “Oops, she’sgetting a bit big for her boots. Let’s do something about that.” So I mutterand I deflect and I talk about how grateful I am, all the while thinking,please, vengeful gods, don’t take it all away. Because, you see, it really is a cool job. But…“So, what book is this you have coming out?Three, right? Oh, you’re an old hand at this now.” And I smile and I say yes and then I go andlock myself in the room and cry from the sheer terror of it all. Because the thing is, it’s still the same,even three books in. There’s the day to day work, which, again, is totallyawesome. And yet, each morning I sit before my computer and feel the sparks offear erupting in my insides. What if today is the day that I forget how to write?What if today is the day that those words simply will not come and that blankscreen just stares at me and stares at me until I am battered down intosubmission. How dare I do a job like this? I am just anaverage woman from an average town. To get to do something like this feels likethe unlikeliest of mistakes. What if today is the day that the universerealises what it has done, and it all goes away? Then there is the book-out-in-the-wordthing. My baby. Out there. All alone. I confess that, for the most part, I trynot to read reviews as it seems like the most effective way to keep somedistance between me and the lunatic asylum. But, when I do read reviews, I willscour (and I mean SCOUR) them for the worst they can throw at me. Even in asparklingly brilliant review, I will hunt for some meaty bit of criticism thatI can use to beat myself across the head with for days. Yes. Yes, there is something wrong with me.Then there are sales. Oh, god! You see, youwant good sales. Obviously. Your publisher has worked extremely hard andinvested an awful lot in your creation. You want to see that faith rewarded.But then begins the insidious little thought - well, what if they are too good?What if I can’t write another book that can sell that well and then the salesplummet and oh-my-god-we’re-all-going-to-die-somebody-get-me-a-drink. As you can see, I like to plan ahead withmy worrying…I read somewhere recently that creativetypes are the most prone to anxiety because their powers of imagination providea virtual trough of horror stories, projected apocalyptic outcomes, from whichthey can select. Yay!But the thing is, this job I do, it fallsdecidedly outside the realm of normal jobs. I get to make things up for aliving. I live three quarters of my life in a fantasy world and I get paidfor it!!! Yes, it is pressure filled. It is a job that involves making alarge percentage of your inner life public. You pour yourself out onto thepage, make yourself vulnerable for people to see. The best of writing comeswhen what is on the page is more than words, static two dimensional characters.We have to create people, and people have tragedies and pain, and when theylive that, we live that, and so sometimes that can make you more than a littlecrazy. But this is not pressure like that experienced by a police officer onthe beat on a Friday night who has to insert themselves between two peopleintent on killing one another. It is not pressure like a soldier who has to putone foot in front of another, knowing full well that any one of those steps maycause the ground to erupt beneath him and his world to end in a flash of lightand pain. This pressure, the pressure that comes withthis job, it comes from being so damned privileged. From having been given anopportunity to do what so many people dream of, and from wanting so very badlyto be worthy of that opportunity. So, each day I take a few deep, calmingbreaths. I remind myself that I have done this before. That I can do thisagain. And I begin anew, each day striving to be worthy of the good fortune Ihave received. Seriously, I think that by book four, I’llhave this thing down…About Emma KavanaghEmma Kavanagh was born and raised in South Wales. After graduating with aPhD in Psychology from Cardiff University, she spentmany years working as a police and military psychologist, training firearmsofficers, command staff and military personnel throughout the UK and Europe.She lives in South Wales with her husband and young sons.Readers can find out more about Emma on her Facebook page and follow Emma on Twitter - @EmmaLK The Missing HoursBy Emma KavanaghPublished by Cornerstone ( 21 April 2016)ISBN: 978-1780894676Publisher's descriptionOne moment, Selena Cole is in theplayground with her children and the next, she has vanished without a trace.A woman returnsTwenty hours later, Selena is found safeand well, but with no memory of where she has been.What took place in those missing hours, andare they linked to the discovery of a nearby murder?‘Is it a forgetting or a deception?’Read my review here.Follow the Blog TourThe Missing HoursBy Emma KavanaghPublished by Cornerstone (21 April 2016)ISBN: 978-1780894676Publisher's descriptionA womandisappears One moment,Selena Cole is in the playground with her children and the next, she hasvanished without a trace.A womanreturnsTwentyhours later, Selena is found safe and well, but with no memory of where she hasbeen.What tookplace in those missing hours, and are they linked to the discovery of a nearbymurder?My verdictThe Missing Hours is a well-written standalone crime thriller that's tightly plotted with well-developed characters.Selena Cole, mother of two young girls, mysteriously vanishes for 20 hours. Where was she? Was she kidnapped? And why can't she remember anything? Meanwhile, a local solicitor has been murdered in a vicious attack. Detectives Finn Hale and Leah Mackay are working the two cases and wonder whether the two crimes could be linked.Selena Cole specialises in kidnap and ransom cases, negotiating for the safe return of hostages all over the world. I found the K&R aspect of the plot particularly fascinating - especially the chapters about Selena's previous case files that are scattered throughout the book. By covering 'new ground', this gave the book an edge over some of the other crime thrillers I have read recently. It's clear that Emma Kavanagh has researched this topic in detail, and her own experience as a police and military psychologist certainly shines through in her writing.The Missing Hours is written from multiple viewpoints and it's so easy to get right inside the characters' heads. The two detectives are brother and sister, which leads to great interaction, not just as colleagues but as siblings too. Vivid descriptions from the first page really bring the setting to life. There are many twists and turns, which keep the plot moving at a fast pace, and I was intrigued all the way through.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

The stranger hands Sophie a letter and issues an threat: open theletter at her party that evening, in front of family and friends, at exactly 8p.m., or those she loves will be in grave danger.What canthe letter possibly contain? This willbe no ordinary party; Sophie is not the only person keeping a secret about theevening ahead. When the clock strikes eight, the course of several people'slives will be altered for ever.My verdictYou Sent Me a Letter is a fast-paced psychological thriller. I was gripped from the first page and read the whole book in one sitting.Most of the story takes place over one day (Sophie's 40th birthday), from the moment an intruder appears in Sophie's bedroom and hands her a letter that she must open at her party that evening. She's warned not to tell anyone about the letter or her family will be harmed.You Sent Me a Letter was a great read and kept me guessing to the end. It's cleverly plotted, as Sophie struggles to keep the letter a secret while worrying about what it's going to reveal. I felt some of the party planning scenes could have been cut down slightly to keep the action moving, but this didn't detract from the plot. I wasn't sure which character was the culprit - and the ending was a complete surprise (although I was left with a few few unanswered questions).I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.ShtumBy Jem LesterPublished by Orion (7 April 2016)ISBN: 978-1409162971Publisher's descriptionBen Jewellhas hit breaking point.

They want to send him to a specialist residential school, where they feel he'll get the help he needs, as well as a better quality of life than they can offer. But the local authority thinks otherwise, and wants Jonah to go a local day school with an autism unit. Emma persuades Ben to move out, explaining that a single dad will have more chance of getting the right help for Jonah than a married couple. So Ben reluctantly moves in with his elderly father Georg.Shtum is a story of friendships, relationships, denial and fighting for what you believe in. Jem Lester gets right into the heart of Ben and Georg's relationship, their love for Jonah, and also Georg's secret family history. The story is all about communication - Jonah can't communicate and none of the adults want to, which is where the problems lie. The book is filled with strong believable characters who will make you laugh and cry.

{"title": "The Butcher's Hook by Janet Ellis", "date": "Wednesday 13 April 2016", "text": "The Butcher's HookBy Janet EllisPublished by Two Roads (25 February 2016)ISBN: 978-1473625112Publisher's descriptionGeorgianLondon, in the summer of 1763.Atnineteen, Anne Jaccob is awakened to the possibility of joy when she meets Fub,the butcher's apprentice, and begins to imagine a life of passion with him. The onlydaughter of well-to-do parents, Anne lives a sheltered life. Her home is amiserable place. Though her family want for nothing, her father is uncaring,her mother is ailing, and the baby brother who taught her to love is dead.Unfortunately her parents have already chosen a more suitable husband for herthan Fub.But Anne isa determined young woman, with an idiosyncratic moral compass. In the matter ofpursuing her own happiness, she shows no fear or hesitation. Even if it meansgetting a little blood on her hands.My verdictThe Butcher's Hook is a dark and twisted 'coming of age' novel set in 18th century gothic London.Anne Jaccob lives in a wealthy yet gloomy household with a sickly mother, a father who ignores her and staff who tiptoe around her.  Her father arranges to marry her off to a wealthy older man, but Anne has her eye on the local butcher boy Fub instead. This feisty 19-year-old is determined not to bow to her father's wishes, and takes rather drastic measures to make her own dreams come true.I found it difficult to like Anne, the repressed teenager who gradually learns a lot about love, life and death. Yet she definitely left a lasting impression on me. It soon became clear that Anne isn't as demure and sweet as she first appears, and this is definitely a case of 'girl behaving badly' by the end of the novel. In fact, it seemed to be a novel of two halves, as Anne's personality and outlook on life changed significantly throughout the book.The Butcher's Hook was certainly not what I was expecting, with its dark and sinister undertones. The story isn't necessarily believable, but the book itself is well written and keeps the plot moving. I do feel it finished a bit too abruptly and would love to know what happened to Anne next. I suspect the story may be continued in Janet Ellis' next book.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

Blog Tour author guest post.", "date": "Tuesday 12 April 2016", "text": "Today it's my stop on the blog tour for the stunning In Her Wake by Amanda Jennings. I'm delighted to welcome Amanda for 'St Michael's Mount Discs' - the eight tracks Amanda would want to be stranded with on a desert island, and why. I haven't stopped raving about Amanda's book ever since I read it for the first time (yes, I've read it twice so far) - and I'm sure I'll continue to do so (rave about it AND read it again). I know already that In Her Wake is going to be one of my top reads of 2016. If you haven't yet read my review, you'll find the link below. And if you haven't yet read In Her Wake, don't wait any longer. In Her Wake is published by Orenda Books and is available in all formats NOW.St Michael's Mount Discs by Amanda JenningsWhen I was a child one of my favouritethings to do was walk along the causeway to St Michael’s Mount. My grandmother adored the Mount - her home had a viewacross the fields from Gulval and out across Mount’s bay and the Mount - and when we were small she would take us outthere. I was fascinated by this magic pathway which only revealed itself at lowtide. I I would always be wracked with a growing anxiety as I kept an eye onthe rising tide which would cut us off from the mainland. I’d ask my mum quietly what would happen if we became stranded. Wherewould we sleep? What would we eat? And even though she assured me that we wouldbe able to escape on a fishing boat, there was always a sense of relief when wefinally stepped off the seaweed-slippery stones and on to the safety of thesand of Marazion, generally with our jeans rolled up to the knee, and thecauseway covered in a half a foot of seawater (My gran and mum enjoyed cuttingit fine…) With this in mind I thought I’d do my own version of Desert Island Discs. So here is my St Michael’s Mount Discs, a list of the eight tracks I’d want to be stranded with and why…What a Wonderful World, Louis ArmstrongMy husband and I met at university and inour college bar this song would always be the last song played and we’d always be stuck in a loved-up youthful clinch as the lights wentup to the last few bars of the song. We chose it for our first dance at ourwedding and whenever I hear it it makes me feel happy and young and in love.March of the Montagues and Capulets (alsoDance of the Knights), Sergei ProkofievI’mnot a diehard classical music fan - insofar as I don’t often choose to listen to Classical radio or albums - but I dolove the ballet and opera. This, from Romeo and Juliet, is the first piece ofmusic that moved me to tears with it’ssheer passion. I would turn it up super loud in my my late teens, close my eyesand conduct manically. Sadly, it’snow the theme tune of The Apprentice. (Oi, Suralan, back off my song…!)Blue Velvet,Bobby VintonI used to sing this to my first daughterwhen she was a baby. She was a dreadful sleeper in those early days (though nowaged eighteen she seems to have improved) and in the wee small hours, thismagic song had the capacity to not only calm her, but calm an exhausted me aswell. Wicked Game,Chris IsaakI adore this song. It was the musicalinspiration for my character, Anna, in Sworn Secret, my first book. ‘It’s a wicked game you play, to makeme feel this way, what a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you…’This song is packed full of desire and mood, and itmakes me fill up with emotion listening to it. What’s Up, Four Non BlondesAnother song I ramp up to full volume andsing as loud as I can. I love the line ‘And so I wake in the morning and I step outside, and I take a deepbreath and I get real high, and I scream at the top of my lungs, what’s going on?’ I love the idea of getting high on fresh air and at the same timescreaming in frustration when the world seems to have gone insane. When badthings are happening in the world, I’llput this on and shout it loud.Lose Yourself,EminemThis is the song I played on loop, whilst shadowboxing (true fact!), as I was gearing up to submit my first book to agents. It’s all about pushing your fears to one side and grabbing yourchances. The beat and lyrics are awesome for getting your battle-juicesflowing, and it reminds me not to be scared of failure or shackled by nerves,and to never to give up. ‘You only getone shot…this opportunity only comes once.’(Watch 8 Mile, the film that features this songand stars Eminem, for similar inspiration…)Title Unknown,James BluntWhen I was nineteen I went to the funeral ofa friend, the seventeen year old son of one of my mum’s best friends, who’d tragicallydied following a brain aneurysm. We were in the church, it was terribly sad, asall funerals are, but none more so than those of young people. His best schoolfriend sat down in front of the hushed congregation and sang a song he’d written in his friend’shonour. His voice filled the church and was so beautiful, so moving, soincredible that it cut right to my core. I wrote to my mother’s friend after the funeral telling her how beautiful I thought thesong was and she sent me a copy. I was at university and for about three weeksI played the song continuously. Years later, whilst listening to the radio, thesame unmistakable voice came on. That boy who so mesmerised me in the churchwas James Blunt. Sheer beauty and his voice still moves me today. I Don’t Feel Like Dancing, Scissor SistersOne of my favourite all-time tracks. I’ve seen the Scissor Sisters in concert and they are amazing. I’m choosing this song because I always feel like dancing, and a bitof moonlit dancing on the Mount, maybe along the harbour wall looking out tosea, would be just what the the situation required, I think…Thank you for having me on the blog, Vicki, and for allowing me to indulge in my fantasy playlist! About Amanda JenningsAmanda Jennings made her literary début with theinternationally bestselling novel Sworn Secret.

{"title": "The Widow by Fiona Barton", "date": "Sunday 10 April 2016", "text": "The WidowBy Fiona BartonPublished by Transworld (14 January 2016)ISBN: 978- 0593076217Publisher's descriptionWe've allseen him: the man - the monster - staring from the front page of everynewspaper, accused of a terrible crime.But whatabout her: the woman who grips his arm on the courtroom stairs – the wife whostands by him?JeanTaylor’s life was blissfully ordinary. Nice house, nice husband. Glen was allshe’d ever wanted: her Prince Charming. Until hebecame that man accused, that monster on the front page. Jean was married to aman everyone thought capable of unimaginable evil.But nowGlen is dead and she’s alone for the first time, free to tell her story on herown terms.Jean Tayloris going to tell us what she knows.My verdictThe Widow has a clever plot concept. A man who was accused of being a paedophile and killer has died in a tragic accident. Now his widow Jean speaks out about the past. The book is narrated by various different people (the widow, a journalist, a police officer etc) so you get to read different sides of the same story (in the past and present). The only person who can't tell his side is the accused.Jean's unreliability was an important aspect of the plot. I expected her to be much older from the narrative and dialogue, and I was shocked when her actual age was revealed around a third into the book. Overall, The Widow was an enjoyable read. I was expecting a massive twist towards the end, one that I hadn't predicted, but sadly it didn't come.This book is well written and will certainly attract psychological thriller fans. Fans of The Girl on the Train and Disclaimer, in particular, are likely to love it. I can see it being a bestseller for 2016.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Extract from My Grandmother Sends Her Regards & Apologises by Fredrik Backman - blog tour", "date": "Thursday 7 April 2016", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Fredrik Backman's My Grandmother Sends Her Regards & Apologises, which is published in paperback by Sceptre today (7 April 2016). Below is an extract from the book, followed by a link to my review and a Q&A with Fredrik Backman last year. READ THE EXTRACTTOBACCO Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero. That’s justhow it is. Anyone who doesn’t agree needs their head examined. That’s what Elsa’s granny says, at least.  Elsa is seven, going on eight. She knows she isn’tespecially good at being seven. She knows she’s different. Her headmaster saysshe needs to ‘fall into line’ in order to achieve ‘a better fit with herpeers’. Other adults describe her as ‘very grown-up for her age.’ Elsa knowsthis is just another way of saying ‘massively annoying for her age,’ becausethey only tend to say this when she corrects them for mispronouncing ‘déjà vu’or not being able to tell the difference between ‘me’ and ‘I’ at the end of asentence. Smart-arses usually can’t, hence the ‘grown-up for her age’ comment,generally said with a strained smile at her parents. As if she has a mentalimpairment, as if Elsa has shown them up by not being totally thick justbecause she’s seven. And that’s why she doesn’t have any friends except Granny.Because all the other seven-year-olds in her school are as idiotic asseven-year- olds tend to be, but Elsa is different. She shouldn’t take any notice of what those muppetsthink, says Granny. Because all the best people are different – look atsuperheroes. After all, if superpowers were normal everyone would have them. Granny is seventy-seven years old, going onseventy-eight. She’s not very good at it either. You can tell she’s old becauseher face looks like newspaper stuffed into wet shoes, but no one ever accusesGranny of being grown-up for her age. ‘Perky,’ people sometimes say to Elsa’smum, looking either fairly worried or fairly angry as Mum sighs and asks howmuch she owes for the damages. Or when Granny’s smoking at the hospital setsthe fire alarm off and she starts ranting and raving about how ‘everything hasto be so bloody politically correct these days!’ when the security guardsmake her extinguish her cigarette. Or that time she made a snowman inBritt-Marie and Kent’s garden right under their balcony and dressed it up ingrown-up clothes so it looked as if a person had fallen from the roof. Or thattime those prim men wearing spectacles started ringing all the doorbells andwanted to talk about God and Jesus and heaven, and Granny stood on her balconywith her dressing gown flapping open, shooting at them with her paintball gun,and Britt-Marie couldn’t quite decide if she was most annoyed about thepaintball-gun thing or the not-wearing-anything-under-the- dressing-gown thing,but she reported both to the police just to be on the safe side. Those are the times, Elsa supposes, that people findGranny perky for her age. They also say that Granny is mad, but in actual factshe’s a genius. It’s just that she’s a bit of a crackpot at the same time. Sheused to be a doctor, and she won prizes and journalists wrote articles abouther and she went to all the most terrible places in the world when everyoneelse was getting out. She saved lives and fought evil everywhere on earth. Assuperheroes do. But one day someone decided she was too old to savelives, even if Elsa quite strongly suspects what they really meant by ‘too old’was ‘too crazy.’ Granny refers to this person as ‘Society’ and says it’s onlybecause everything has to be so bloody politically correct nowadays that she’sno longer allowed to make incisions in people. And that it was really mainlyabout Society getting so bleeding fussy about the smoking ban in the operatingtheatres, and who could work under those sorts of conditions? So now she’s mainly at home driving Britt-Marie andMum round the bend. Britt-Marie lives one floor down from Granny. And reallyBritt-Marie also lives one floor down from Elsa’s mum, because Elsa’s mum livesnext door to Elsa’s granny. And Elsa obviously also lives next door to Granny,because Elsa lives with her mum. Except every other weekend, when she liveswith Dad and Lisette. And of course George is also Granny’s neighbour, becausehe lives with Mum. It’s a bit all over the place. But anyway, to get back to the point: life-saving anddriving people nuts are Granny’s superpowers. Which perhaps makes her a bit ofa dysfunctional superhero. Elsa knows this because she looked up‘dysfunctional’ on Wikipedia. People of Granny’s age describe Wikipedia as ‘anencyclopaedia, but on the net!’ Encyclopaedias are what Elsa describes as‘Wikipedia, but analogue.’ Elsa has checked ‘dysfunctional’ in both places andit means that something is not functioning quite as it’s supposed to. Which isone of Elsa’s favourite things about her granny. But maybe not today. Because it’s half past one in themorning and Elsa is fairly tired and would really like to go back to bed.Except that’s not going to happen, because Granny’s been throwing turds at apoliceman. It’s a little complicated. Elsa looks around the little rectangular room andyawns listlessly and so widely that she looks like she’s trying to swallow herown head. ‘I did tell you not to climb the fence,’ shemutters, checking her watch. Granny doesn’t answer. Elsa takes off her Gryffindorscarf and puts it in her lap. She was born on Boxing Day seven years ago(almost eight). The same day some German scientists recorded the strongest everemission of gamma radiation from a magnetar over the Earth. Admittedly Elsadoesn’t know what a magnetar is, but it’s some kind of neutron star. And itsounds a little like ‘Megatron,’ which is the name of the evil one in Transformers,which is what simpletons who don’t read enough quality literature call ‘achildren’s programme.’ In actual fact the Transformers are robots, but if youlook at it academically they could also be counted as superheroes. Elsa is verykeen on both Transformers and neutron stars and she imagines that an‘emission of gamma radiation’ would look a bit like that time Granny spilledFanta on Elsa’s iPhone and tried to dry it out in the toaster. And Granny saysit makes Elsa special to have been born on a day like that. And being specialis the best way of being different. Granny is busy distributing small heaps of tobacco allover the wooden table in front of her and rolling them into rustling cigarettepapers. ‘I said I told you not to climb the fence!’ Granny makes a snorting sound and searches the pocketsof her much too large overcoat for a lighter. She doesn’t seem to be taking anyof this very seriously, mainly because she never seems to take anythingseriously. Except when she wants to smoke and can’t find a lighter. ‘It was a tiny little fence, for God’s sake!’ she saysbreezily. ‘It’s nothing to get worked up about.’ ‘Don’t you “for God’s sake” me! You’re the one whothrew shit at the police.’ ‘Stop fussing. You sound like your mother. Do you havea lighter?’ ‘I’m seven!’ ‘How long are you going to use that as an excuse?’ ‘Until I’m not seven any more?’ Granny mumbles something that sounds like ‘Not a crimeto ask, is it?’ and continues riffling through her pockets. ‘I don’t think you can smoke in here, actually,’ Elsainforms her, sounding calmer now and fingering the long rip in the Gryffindorscarf. ‘Course you can smoke. We’ll just open a window.’ Elsa looks sceptically at the windows. ‘I don’t think they’re the sort of windows that open.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘They’ve got bars on them.’ Granny glares with dissatisfaction at the windows. Andthen at Elsa. ‘So now you can’t even smoke at the police station.Jesus. It’s like being in 1984.’ Elsa yawns again. ‘Can I borrow your phone?’ ‘What for?’ ‘To check something.’ ‘Where?’ ‘Online.’ ‘You invest too much time on that internet stuff.’ ‘You mean spend.’ ‘I beg your pardon?’ ‘What I mean is, you don’t use “invest” in that way.You wouldn’t go round saying, “I invested two hours in reading Harry Potterand the Philosopher’s Stone”, would you?’ Granny just rolls her eyes and hands her the phone.‘Did you ever hear about the girl who blew up because she did too muchthinking?’ The policeman who shuffles into the room looks very,very tired. ‘I want to call my lawyer,’ Granny demands at once. ‘I want to call my mum!’ Elsa demands at once. ‘In that case I want to call my lawyer first!’ Grannyinsists. The policeman sits down opposite them and fidgets witha little pile of papers. ‘Your mother is on her way,’ he says to Elsa, with asigh. Granny makes the sort of dramatic gasp that onlyGranny knows how to do. ‘Why did you call her? Are you mad?’ sheprotests, as if the policeman just told her he was going to leave Elsa in theforest to be raised by a pack of wolves. ‘She’ll be bloody livid!’ ‘We have to call the child’s legal guardian,’ thepoliceman explains calmly. ‘I am also the child’s legal guardian! I am thechild’s grand- mother!’ Granny fumes, rising slightly out of her chairand shaking her unlit cigarette menacingly. ‘It’s half past one in the morning. Someone has totake care of the child.’ ‘Yes, me! I’m taking care of the child!’ shesplutters. The policeman makes a fairly strained attempt togesture amicably across the interrogation room. ‘And how do you feel it’s going so far?’ Granny looks slightly offended. ‘Well . . . everything was going just fine until youstarted chasing me.’ ‘You broke into a zoo.’ ‘It was a tiny little fence—’ ‘There’s no such thing as a “tiny” burglary.’ Granny shrugs and makes a brushing movement over thetable, as if she thinks they’ve stretched this out long enough. The policemannotices the cigarette and eyes it dubiously. ‘Oh, come on! I can smoke in here, can’t I?’ He shakes his head sternly. Granny leans forward,looks him deep in the eyes and smiles. ‘Can’t you make an exception? Not even for little oldme?’ Elsa gives Granny a little shove in the side andswitches to their secret language. Because Granny and Elsa have a secretlanguage, as all grannies must have with their grandchildren, because by lawthat’s a requirement, says Granny. Or at least it should be. ‘Drop it Granny. It’s, like, illegal to flirt withpolicemen.’ ‘Says who?’ ‘Well, the police for starters!’ Elsa replies. ‘The police are supposed to be there for the sake ofthe citizens,’ Granny hisses. ‘I pay my taxes, you know.’ The policeman looks at them as you do when aseven-year- old and a seventy-seven-year-old start arguing in a secret languagein a police station in the middle of the night. Then Granny’s eyelashes tremblealluringly at him as she once again points pleadingly at her cigarette, butwhen he shakes his head, Granny leans back in the chair and exclaims in normallanguage: ‘I mean, this political correctness! It’s worse thanapartheid for smokers in this bloody country nowadays!’ ‘How do you spell that?’ asks Elsa. ‘What?’ Granny sighs as you do when precisely thewhole world is against you, even though you pay tax. ‘That apartight thing,’ says Elsa. ‘A-p-p-a-r-t-e-j-d,’ Granny spells. Elsa immediately Googles it on Granny’s phone. Ittakes her a few attempts – Granny’s always been a rubbish speller. Meanwhilethe policeman explains that they’ve decided to let them go, but Granny will becalled in at a later date to explain the burglary and ‘other aggravations’. ‘What aggravations?’ ‘Driving illegally, to begin with.’ ‘What do you mean, illegally? That’s my car! I don’tneed permission to drive my own car, do I?’ ‘No,’ replies the policeman patiently, ‘But you needa driving licence.’  Granny throws out her arms in exasperation. She’sjust launched into another rant about this being a Big Brother society whenElsa whacks the phone sharply against the table. ‘It’s got NOTHING to do with that apartheid thing!!!You compared not being able to smoke with apartheid and it’s not the same thingat all. It’s not even CLOSE!’ Granny waves her hand resignedly. ‘I meant it was . . . you know, more or less likethat—’ ‘It isn’t at all!’ ‘It was a metaphor, for God’s sake—’ ‘A bloody crap metaphor!’ ‘How would you know?’ ‘WIKIPEDIA!’ Granny turns in defeat to the policeman. ‘Do yourchildren carry on like this?’ The policeman looks uncomfortable. ‘We . . . don’t let the children surf the netunsupervised . . .’ Granny stretches out her arms towards Elsa, a gesturethat seems to say ‘You see!’ Elsa just shakes her head and crosses her armsvery hard. ‘Granny, just say sorry for throwing turds at thepolice, and we can go home,’ she snorts in the secret language, though stillvery expressly upset about that whole apartheid thing. ‘Sorry,’ says Granny in the secret language. ‘To the police, not me, you muppet.’ ‘There’ll be no apologising to fascists here. I paymy taxes. And you’re the muppet.’ Granny sulks. ‘Takes one to know one.’ Then they both sit with their arms crossed,demonstratively looking away from each other until Granny nods at the policemanand says in normal language: ‘Would you be kind enough to let my spoiltgranddaughter know that if she takes this attitude she’s quite welcome to walkhome?’ ‘Tell her I’m going home with Mum and she’s theone who can walk!’ Elsa replies at once. ‘Tell HER she can—’ The policeman stands up without a word, walks out ofthe room and closes the door behind him, as if intending to go into anotherroom and bury his head in a large, soft cushion and yell as loud as he can. ‘Now look what you did,’ says Granny. ‘Look what YOU did!’ Eventually a heavyset policewoman with piercing greeneyes comes in instead. It doesn’t seem to be the first time she’s run intoGranny, because she smiles in that tired way so typical of people who knowGranny, and says: ‘You have to stop doing this, we also have real criminals toworry about.’ Granny just mumbles, ‘Why don’t you stop doing this?’ Andthen they’re allowed to go home. Standing on the pavement waiting for her mother, Elsafingers the rip in her scarf. It goes right through the Gryffindor emblem. Shetries as hard as she can not to cry, but doesn’t make much of a success of it. ‘Ah come on, your mum can mend that,’ says Granny,trying to be cheerful, giving her a little punch on the shoulder. Elsa looks up anxiously. ‘And, you know . . . we can tell your mum the scarfgot torn when you were trying to stop me climbing the fence to get to themonkeys.’ Elsa nods and runs her fingers over the scarf again.It didn’t get torn when Granny was climbing the fence. It got torn at schoolwhen three older girls who hate Elsa without Elsa really understanding why gothold of her outside the canteen and hit her and tore her scarf and threw itdown the toilet. Their jeers are still echoing round Elsa’s head. Grannynotices the look in her eyes and leans forward before whispering in theirsecret language: ‘One day we’ll take those losers at your school toMiamas and throw them to the lions!’ Elsa dries her eyes with the back of her hand and smilesfaintly. ‘I’m not stupid, Granny,’ she whispers. ‘I know youdid all that stuff tonight to make me forget about what happened at school.’ Granny kicks at some gravel and clears her throat. ‘I didn’t want you to remember this day because of thescarf. So I thought instead you could remember it as the day your Granny brokeinto a zoo—’ ‘And escaped from a hospital,’ Elsa says with a grin. ‘And escaped from a hospital,’ says Granny with agrin. ‘And threw turds at the police.’ ‘Actually it was soil! Or mainly soil, anyway.’ ‘Changing memories is a good superpower, I suppose.’Granny shrugs. ‘If you can’t get rid of the bad you have to top itup with more goody stuff.’ ‘That’s not aword.’     ‘I know.’ ‘Thanks Granny,’ says Elsa and leans her head againsther arm. And then Granny just nods and whispers: ‘We’re knightsof the kingdom of Miamas, we have to do our duty.’ Because all seven-year-olds deserve superheroes. And anyone who doesn’t agree needs their headexamined.

She thinks that she knows families, their secrets and their faultlines. But as she begins investigating the girl's disappearance nothing canprepare her for what she's about to face.Becausewhen Harm's family is threatened, everything tastes like fear...My verdictTastes Like Fear is the third book in the DI Marnie Rome series, and yet again Sarah Hilary has written a stunning crime novel. This could easily be read as a standalone, although I had already read No Other Darkness, the second book in the series.Sarah Hilary tackles some very real issues in her books, twisting seemingly normal scenarios into something quite shocking. Tastes Like Fear looks at homeless teenagers trying to find somewhere that will keep them off the streets. When a man offers them shelter, they believe they've found a family set up where they can feel safe and have a sense of belonging. But Harm is lurking at every corner.Marnie Rome is one of my favourite fictional detectives - she's very real and believable with true emotions. In Tastes Like Fear, she's battling with her own demons too, as her foster brother Steven (imprisoned after the brutal murders of her parents) continues to play with her mind.The book is chilling and terrifying in places with a complex yet easy-to-read entertaining plot. Sarah Hilary certainly loves to play with her readers'  minds. Tastes Like Fear is a creepy and haunting read. I couldn't put it down and it kept me guessing right until the last page.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},

His weapons of choice are razor-sharp icicles. This is Jack Frost.Now a fullyqualified criminologist, Georgina McKenzie is called upon by the Dutch policeto profile this cunning and brutal murderer. Are they looking for a hit man ora frenzied serial-killer? Could there be a link to a cold missing persons’ casethat George had worked with Chief Inspector Paul van den Bergen – two abductedtoddlers he could never quite give up on?The huntfor Jack Frost sparks a dangerous, heart-rending journey through the toughestneighbourhoods in Europe, where refugees and Roma gypsies scratch a living onthe edge of society. Walking into the dark, violent world of a trans-nationaltrafficking ring, can George outrun death to shed light on two terriblemysteries?My verdictThe Girl Who Walked in the Shadows could possibly be read as a standalone. But I suggest you read the series in the correct order to understand the relationship between the main characters, Georgina (George) MacKenzie and Chief Inspector Paul van den Bergen. This book is set two years after the previous one (The Girl Who Broke the Rules). George is now a fully qualified criminologist, but she's just as opinionated as she was in the previous books. Yet again, she's working with Paul to solve some intriguing crimes, and their personal relationship is as complex as ever.This is certainly the darkest of the three books in the series. It's a story of child abduction, paedophile rings and brutal murders. A serial killer nicknamed Jack Frost is taking advantage of the Arctic weather conditions to kill his victims. In a seemingly unconnected plot, taking place in the past, two children go missing in Amsterdam and their parents are looking for answers, using desperate measures to discover the truth.As with the first two books, The Girl Who Walked in the Shadows is split mainly between London, Cambridge and Amsterdam. The three different settings work well yet again, with some very strong characters in each location. It took me a little while to get to grips with the different subplots in the book, especially the switch between past and present, but the jigsaw pieces gradually slotted into place. 'The Girl Who books' are gripping and highly enjoyable, with plenty of twists and turns. They are supposed to be a trilogy, but I hope it isn't the last we see of George.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Click here to read my review of Marnie's first book, The Girl Who Wouldn't Die.Click here to read my review of her second book, The Girl Who Broke the Rules.Click here to read about her pathway to publication.Follow the Blog Tour:"},

She's now on a mission to protect other women from predators. But when Flora disappears, it's up to Detective D.D. Warren to find out why.Find Her is a fast paced book and I read it in two short sittings. It's cleverly plotted and kept me guessing all the way through.  Certain chapters, set in the past, were highly sinister with their claustrophobic setting. I felt quite drained by the end of the book and had to take a moment to catch my breath.This is one of those books that's an uncomfortable read but completely addictive. I'm not prone to nightmares. But if you are, I suggest you don't read this late at night, or when you're alone!I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "The Spy of Venice by Benet Brandreth - author guest post on the locations of Venice", "date": "Friday 25 March 2016", "text": "I would like to welcome Benet Brandreth to my blog today. Read below to discover the places that inspired the locations in his novel The Spy of Venice, and the truth behind them. The Spy of Venice was published by Twenty7 on 24 March 2016.My Venice - the inspiration behind The Spy of VeniceVenice is a magical city today but in thesixteenth century it was a place of wonders.  The Spy of Venice is set in1585.  By that time Venice was no longer at the height of its power. Its great Mediterranean sea empire had been rolled back by the advances of theOttomans and other, envious, Italian states had challenged its control of theVeneto region.  Nonetheless, there were few that could challenge the cityfor splendour and richness.  Indeed, the people of Venice were keen toshow off their City in an attempt to convince the world that they were stillstrong.  As a result the late sixteenth century saw an explosion ofbuilding as Venice sought to cement its myth of power – Venice the Just, Venicethe Rich, Venice the Magnificent. A visitor, like William Shakespeare,arriving across the lagoon would have landed on the Piazetta di San Marco, thesmaller piazza adjoining the Palazzo Ducale, the seat of the Doge.  Veniceprided itself on its system of government, ostensibly republican but inpractice oligarchical.  The Ducal Palace was and is a magnificent symbolof the power and wealth of Venice and an essential element of any trip to thecity.  There are often long queues to get in so good trick is to go roundthe corner to the Museo Correr andbuy one of the tickets that includes access to the Ducal Palace to avoid thequeues.  Before you go in to the Palace you should pause to admire thecarving atop the pillars around the colonnade at the base of the Palace. That at the corner shows the temptation of Eve but all along are symbols of theimportance of the sea to Venice’s power.  Inside, don’t forget to spot thebocca del leone – the Lion’s mouth – a fantastical carved post-box into whichaccusations against fellow citizens could be placed for the attention of theSignoria, the government of Venice.Past the Ducal Palace, at the head of thePiazza San Marco, is the Basilica di San Marco – a church in the easternstyle.  It is little appreciated that Venice was essentially a Byzantinecity and began its history as a province of the Byzantine Empire.  Venicewould later turn on its former master, encouraging the members of the FourthCrusade to sack Constantinople, and carrying back much of the looted plunder toadorn the city.  Atop the Basilica one can still see the four prancinghorses taken from the Hippodrome in Constantinople.  Of them the Genoese,the City’s great rivals, used to say that Venice’s arrogance would never bebridled until those four horses were. If you pass on from the Basilica you gothrough an arch under the magnificent astronomical clock that marks the easternend of the Procuratie Vecchie, the offices of the government of Venice. It is here that William and Oldcastle, in their guise as the English ambassadorand his man, would have presented themselves.  Now one can enjoy adelicious coffee at one of the cafés overlooking the square (although one wouldbe wiser to use the cheaper and better café in the Museo Correr instead!) The Piazza was a place for many to meet and to do business.  If you hadbeen there in 1585 you would have appreciated how Venice was a liminal city –at the border of east and west, a cosmopolitan city – as William says in thenovel – it was not so much Urbis forum as orbis forum – not a marketplace for acity but a marketplace for the world.  And truly all the people of theworld were there:  Thomas Coryat says in his 1611 travelogue:\"[In St Mark's Square] you may see manyPolonians, Slavonians, Persians, Grecians, Turks, Jewes, Christians of all thefamousest regions of Christendome, and each nation distinguished from anotherby their proper and peculiar habits. A singular shew, and by many degrees theworthiest of all the European Countries.\"The road from the astronomical clock leadsnorth from San Marco towards San Pollo and then Rialto.  If you keepheading north you will reach the Rialto bridge.  In 1585 it wasn’t yetbuilt. The previous bridge had burned down at the beginning of the sixteenthcentury and the present bridge would not be built for several years.  Thearea is now often over-crowded with tourists but before you leave its heavingcrush try to find the statue of Gobbo, the hunchback.  It is surely nocoincidence that Shakespeare names the clown in Merchant of Venice LauncelotGobbo after this statue… If you had been Shakespeare you would havehad to cross the Canal Grande using one of the ferry points.  Though, youwould have tried to avoid using the ones by the Rialto though.  Coryatwarns:“There are in Venice thirteen ferries orpassages, commonly called Traghetti, where passengers may be transported in agondola to what place of the City they will. Of which thirteene, one is underthis Rialto bridge. But the boatmen that attend at this ferry are the mostvicious and licentious varlets about all the City.”Keep going but now heading more west thannorth and you will approach the Ponte del Tette – the bridge of – there’s nopolite way to put this – tits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_delle_Tette  This is an unassuminglittle bridge but from the balconies and windows about it the courtesans woulddisplay their wares.  Venice took a pragmatic view of prostitution. Since only the oldest son of a wealthy Venetian family might marry, to preservethe family’s fortunes in one set of hands, there was a surplus of unmarriedyoung men with energy to spare and needing an outlet.  In addition, inthose unenlightened times, it was seen as a way of averting the sin ofhomosexuality.  It is estimate that nearly 1 in 10 people in Venice inthat period earned their living through prostitution. Near to the bridge is a restaurant calledAntiche Carampane. TheCa’ Rampane – literally the House of Rampane – was a famous brothel and thename became synonymous with “prostitute”.  If you can ignore the fact thatthe restaurant’s name means “Old Prostitutes” you will enjoy a fine,traditional Venetian meal.Head on to the Scuola Grande di San Rocco. This was a guild house and contains some of the finest paintings ofTintoretto.  Tintoretto’s son Domenico painted Veronica Franco, who is thebasis for the character of Isabella Lisarro in the novel.  The interior is a cool, quiet haven from the turmoil of Veniceoutside and the second floor contains a richness of decoration that has to beseen to be believed.  It is no wonder then that in the novel it is herethat William chooses to go about his wooing of Isabella Lisarro.  Beforeyou go, look at the stone bench outside on which is carved a nine-men’s morrisfield – so that sixteenth century Venetians might have something to entertainthemselves with before going to the church nearby.Now head south towards Dosoduro.  Youwill come to the Ponte dei Pugni, the Bridge of Fists.  It is the most famous of several such bridges in Venice and in the Spy ofVenice, William comes here to muse and remarks on the four footprints set inthe bridge’s floor.  These marked where the champions of the Nicoletti andCastellani clans would stand before one of the bridge battles.  These weretremendous pitched combats between different groups in Venice.  Done asentertainment and as a way of honing the fighting spirit of the Venetian youththey were ideal training for a city that mostly fought in Galley’s. Indeed Venetian experts in the close-quarter combat skills that these contestsdemanded would travel throughout Europe teaching their skills.  Theviolence finally became too much for the city’s authorities to bear though andthe contests were finally banned in the eighteenth century.  Thereafter,participating could leave you serving six years chained to an oar in thegalleys.Venice is an eminently walkable city. It is particularly good to visit in February and March – after Carnival. The city is quieter then but still lovely and one can enjoy the way that itpresents a new, astounding vista with every corner turned.  It is a Cityof possibilities, or romance and of mysteries – and so William finds it The Spyof Venice.About Benet BrandrethBenet Brandreth  is a barrister,rhetoric coach and authority on Shakespeare.  He works regularly with theRoyal Shakespeare Company and the Donmar on Shakespeare’s use of language. The Telegraph has called Benet Brandreth \"one of our nation's mostaccomplished raconteurs\" when reviewing his one-man show, “The BrandrethPapers”, which was a five-star reviewed sell-out at the Edinburgh Festival andon its London transfer. He has also written and performed for radio and thestage.

I loved the way her story is weaved together with the underlying Beatles theme. The other colourful characters' personalities also shine out of the page and really bring the book to life.The Finding of Martha Lost is a very easy, enjoyable read. It's a journey of self-discovery, with gentle humour and a few darker moments thrown into the mix. I've never been to Liverpool myself, and the book makes me want to visit Lime Street Station, spin around for a while and then watch people go by and wonder about their individual stories. The descriptions were so vivid and beautifully written that I could picture the station and its occupants as I read.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

It's a very strange novel - written with warped sense of humour - but is also completely addictive.

A man to whom Wardell is no stranger.Along withElaine Banner, an ambitious special agent juggling life as a single mother withher increasingly high-flying career, Blake must track Wardell down as he cuts aswathe across America, apparently killing at random.But Blakeand Banner soon find themselves sidelined from the case. And as they trydesperately to second guess a man who kills purely for the thrill of it, theyuncover a hornets' nest of lies and corruption. Now Blake must break the rulesand go head to head with the FBI if he is to stop Wardell and expose a deadlyconspiracy that will rock the country.My verdictIn The Killing Season, I met Carter Blake for the first time. He's a man with a mysterious past and who clearly doesn't like to play by the rules. Yet he has principles and certainly has a heart (which reminded me more of Ben Hope than Jack Reacher, although the book will appeal to fans of both).This is a highly intelligent thriller, with its fast-paced plot and non-stop action scenes. I found myself holding my breath on more than one occasion and I was hooked right until the last page. I didn't predict the ending at all, which led to a great finale.And I loved the characters so much (yes, Carter Blake in particular) that I read The Samaritan straight afterwards.The SamaritanBy Mason CrossPublisher by Orion (31 December 2015)ISBN: 978-1409146179Publisher's descriptionWhen themutilated body of a young woman is discovered, LAPD Detective Jessica Allenknows she's seen this MO before.A sadisticserial killer has been operating undetected for a decade, preying on lonefemale drivers who have broken down. The press dub the killer 'the Samaritan',but with no leads, the police investigation quickly grinds to a halt.That's whenCarter Blake shows up to volunteer his services. He's a skilled manhunter whoshares some uncomfortable similarities to the man Allen and her team aretracking. As the slaughter intensifies, Blake must find a way to stop it . . .even if it means bringing his own past crashing down on top of him.My verdictThe Samaritan is the second adventure featuring 'people hunter' Carter Blake. This is another fast-paced action thriller with plenty of twists and turns and a nail-biting finale.The plot focuses on a serial killer who is targeting young women. The police are struggling with leads, but Blake believes he recognises the murderer's distinctive 'signature' so joins the hunt for the killer. Yet again, there are plenty of action scenes, well-rounded characters and a complex plot that kept me guessing all the way through.The Samaritan feeds the reader snippets about Blake's past, which helped to flesh out his character. I am intrigued by the 'Winterlong' operation - this was mentioned throughout the book and seems to be the background for Book 3 (The Time To Kill), which is being published in June 2016.Mason Cross books are ideal for fans of Ben Hope and Jack Reacher. I hope the Carter Blake series goes on and on.I received Advance Reader Copies from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

I would like to welcome Lisa to my blog. Read below to discover the inspiration behind Between You and Me, which is being published by Carina UK on 17 March 2016.The Inspiration behindBetween You and MeIf I’m completelyhonest, the inspiration for Between You and Me seemed to come out of nowhere –the ending of the novel was actually the first idea that came to me, and Idecided it had legs after running it past Mr H and he gave it the thumbs up.Once I had the main idea, it was a question of going back and figuring out whomy characters were and how they ended up in the situation that they did –something that was easier said than done.I haven’t been avictim of a violent relationship, but I do know others who have, so I had a lotof research to do in order to get things just right. I spent hours reading thestories of victims of domestic violence, and talking to several people who hadbeen involved and managed to leave, and it really brought it home to me justhow common an occurrence this kind of behaviour is – it was completelyharrowing and by the time I was finished with the research my characters werescreaming to get put down on the page.The other side of thestory is the idea that people can look at others’ lives and deem them‘perfect’, without ever really knowing what goes on behind closed doors. We allknow people who are ‘lucky’ – they might live in a bigger house than us, drivea better car than us, have better behaved children than us (probably mostdefinitely in my case, Team Hall do love a bit of naughtiness) but we don’tknow the circumstances that put them there, or the struggles that might havetaken place. How do we know what really goeson behind closed doors? None of us knows for sure what happens once thecurtains are drawn.About Lisa HallLisa Hall loves words, reading andeverything there is to love about books. She has dreamed of being a writersince she was a little girl – either that or a librarian - and after years oftalking about it, was finally brave enough to put pen to paper (and let peopleactually read it).  Lisa lives in a smallvillage in Kent, surrounded by her towering TBR pile, a rather large brood ofchildren, dogs, chickens and ponies and her long-suffering husband.

They love each other. But they aren’t happy. Sal cannotleave, no matter what Charlie does – no matter how much it hurts.My verdictBetween You and Me is a fantastic book, but certainly not an easy one to review without giving away any spoilers. It's not always a comfortable read either because of the subject matter, but is definitely a book that MUST be read, especially if you're a fan of domestic noir.Sal and Charlie appear to have the perfect marriage, but behind closed doors it's an entirely different scenario. As the book progresses, the tension builds up and the truth about their relationship bubbles slowly to the surface, leading to a dramatic finale.This is an emotional book covering some serious complex underlying issues that are not always addressed in the public arena, and it will certainly get people talking. Not all of the characters are easy to like, but they are certainly very believable and help to get the reader right into the centre of the plot. I felt like I was living every moment of Sal and Charlie's marriage, as every little detail is vividly described. I could visualise it and even feel it in places.Lisa Hall is an incredibly talented writer, with a plot that keeps you guessing, and is clearly the queen of twists, with a story that left me reeling. This is the first book I have HAD to read twice, certain I missed something crucial the first time round.But there's far more to this book than any twists or turns. And you shouldn't be put off reading Between You and Me if someone has given away the story - it's an amazingly written novel provoking real emotions for the characters.I look forward to reading more of Lisa Hall's books in the future - and can't wait to see what else she has in store.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the Publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Click here to read about Lisa Hall's inspiration for the book.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "5 Top Tips on writing a psychological thriller by Lucie Whitehouse - author feature - Blog Tour", "date": "Wednesday 9 March 2016", "text": "I would like to welcome Lucie Whitehouse to my blog today, for her Keep You Close Blog Tour. Read below for Lucie's 5 top tips on writing a psychological thriller. Keep You Close is being published by Bloomsbury on 10 March 2016.5 Top Tips on writing psychological thrillersBy Lucie WhitehouseIn the past handful of years, psychological thrillers havetaken the reading world by storm. BeforeI Go To Sleep, Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train, this year’s The Widow and countless others – one byone they’ve dominated the bestseller lists and sold in the millions.What makes them so successful? They’re unputdownable – somuch so that Marian Keyes recently coined the term ‘grip lit’ to describe them.The suspense is there from the start, hooking us then building and buildinguntil we’re flying through the pages. Atmospheres are tense and uncertain,everything and everyone shifting and unreliable. ‘Trust no one’ is the rule ofthe road not only for the protagonist but us, the reader. Unlike action thrillers,where the excitement comes from explosions or heists, psychological thrillersderive their power from mental and emotional developments so that a single lineof dialogue can chill us to the bone. And the other pure pleasure? The twists –being kept guessing all the way to the end.Here are my tips for writing one of your own.1. Choose the right point of view. Psychological thrillersare almost always narrated in the first person, I, or in a close third person told ‘over the shoulder’ of theprotagonist, allowing access to his or her private thoughts and fears. For thereader to experience the character’s uncertainty and terror for herself, thereneeds to be as little barrier as possible between the two so seeing inside thecharacter’s mind is essential.2. Ask a major question at the beginning of the book andwithhold the answer until the end. This will give your novel the narrativespine it needs and grab your reader from the start. In Gone Girl, for example, we are faced almost immediately with thequestion of what has happened to Amy Dunne. Is she dead? And if so, was it herhusband who killed her? In Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca, a classic of suspense, we know from the start that thenameless main character and Maxime, her husband, can never go back to Mandalay.The action of the novel tells us why.3. Make your characters complex – and flawed. Ifpsychological suspense as a genre has a central question, it’s this: can weever really know another person? Most frighteningly, can we know the people wethink we know best: our closest friends, our partners? In her new novel, You Will Know Me, to be published inJune in the UK, Megan Abbott asks if we can even know our own children.Characterisation of the major players in a good psychological novel is like a striptease:we are presented with one version and then, gradually, tantalisingly, thelayers come off to show us what’s really underneath. Unreliable narrators are of the essence here. Many of theprotagonists of these novels have a condition that prevents them from beingreliable: Kate in The Girl on the Trainis an alcoholic who blacks out when drinking; Christine in Before I Go To Sleep has a form of amnesia that wipes her memoryevery night. Dissociation, fugue states and denial are common. And of course,these things leave a person vulnerable…… To characters who have an agenda. Because almost everyonein these novels is flawed and therefore has something to hide. Whether it’scriminal or just shameful is for your reader to decide. And that takes us backto the rule of the road: trust no one. In these books, even the protagonist towhose thoughts and fears we have access shouldn’t be completely visible to usstraight away. Some characters – Kate and Christine, above – show us from thestart that they are unreliable witnesses, others don’t so much as hint at it.When they’re revealed, we are thrown completely – thrillingly – for a loop.4. Do the twist. But when setting out to wrong-foot yourreader, pay careful attention: readers are watching for the slightest hint,knowing that in a well-written book, nothing is included without a purpose. Thetrick is to disguise that purpose, to make it look as if you’re including therelevant information for a different reason. In other words, while you’replanting the seeds with one hand, distract the reader with the other. 5. Make sure that every development is logical and bearssecond reading. An attentive reader wanting to understand how he or she hasbeen duped will often go back to find out. The ingenuity of the puzzle is amajor part of the appeal of these books so everything has to make practical andpsychological sense.

Tensions mount between the pair and the two women they havegrabbed as hostages when they find themselves holed upcountry in an isolatedhotel that has been mothballed for the season.Back in thecapital, Gunnhildur, Eiríkur and Helgi find themselves at a dead endinvestigating what appear to be the unrelated disappearance of a mother, herdaughter and their car during a day's shopping, and the death of a thief in ahouse fire.Gunna andher team are faced with a set of riddles but as more people are quizzed itbegins to emerge that all these unrelated incidents are in fact linked. And atthe same time, two increasingly desperate lowlifes have no choice but to makesome big decisions on how to get rid of their accidental hostages...My verdictThis is the fifth in the Gunnhildur Gisladottir series, but the first Quentin Bates book I have read. So you can easily read this as a standalone. Although having read Thin Ice, I now want to start the series from the beginning.Set in Iceland, the Thin Ice plot focuses on two small-time crooks who rob a drug dealer and take two women hostage when their getaway driver doesn't turn up. They end up in an isolated hotel that's been closed for the winter. Meanwhile the police are investigating two seemingly unconnected crimes - a house fire and the disappearance of a mother and her daughter.In Thin Ice, Quentin Bates throws you in at the deep end, starting straight away with an action scene that introduces you to the main characters. Each chapter focuses on a different day in the story - the whole book takes place over eight days - and each chapter is split between the two subplots (the two crooks and the detectives trying to solve the case). The book flows at a fast pace, keeping the two subplots moving, as the tension between the crooks and their hostages builds up.I liked all of the main characters (even if I wasn't supposed to) and loved the chilling atmospheric setting of the hotel. Quentin Bates' vivid descriptions enabled me to picture it as I read. Lots of twists and turns kept me intrigued all the way through, and I thought the book had a great ending (although it wasn't totally unexpected).I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "Two reviews of Jihadi: A Love Story by Yusuf Toropov (and yes, one is by a cat) - Blog Tour", "date": "Sunday 6 March 2016", "text": "I would like(?) to welcome Snarky Cat back to my blog today. This very snarky cat has decided to review Jihadi: A Love Story by Yusuf Toropov for me. But the good news is his review is short and will be followed by my own review. A few months ago, Snarky Cat interviewed Yusuf for me (see below for a link to this fascinating interview). Yusuf's book Jihadi: A Love Story was published by Orenda Books on Kindle on 24 December 2015 and in paperback on 15 February 2016. Cat reviews Jihadi: A Love StoryThey promised me tuna if I wrote this, sowhatever.As you may recall, I had to reach out tothe author to get even the barest idea of what this book was about. He sent mea PDF but I deleted it. At which point I demanded a physical book. Which I got.Anyway I was led to believe the thing was about cats. Guess what. There’s only one cat with aname in the whole story. There’s a bunch of other cats who show up later, butnone of them have names.Why Word Boy thinks he can get away withputting cats in a story without giving each one a name is beyond me.Now. The deal was, one OPENED can of tuna,placed directly in front of me, for a review of 200 words. Not counting theheadline. 143. So. Don’t read this book if you expect astory in which all the cats get names. 161. The one cat who does have a namehas a stupid one, in my opinion. 177. I do prefer John West chunks. In brine.186. I’m supposed to turn this in tonight. Need a few more words. There. 200.And now, here's MY review of Jihadi: A Love StoryJihadi: A Love Story By Yusuf ToropovPublished by Orenda Books (Kindle - 24 December 2015; Paperback - 15 February 2016)ISBN: 978-1910633311Publisher's descriptionA former intelligence agent stands accusedof terrorism, held without charge in a secret overseas prison. His memoir is inthe hands of a brilliant but erratic psychologist whose annotations paint amuch darker picture. As the story unravels, we are forced to assess the truthfor ourselves, and decide not only what really happened on one fateful overseasassignment but who is the real terrorist. Peopled by a diverse andunforgettable cast of characters, whose reliability as narrators is alwaysquestioned, and with a multi-layered plot heaving with unexpected and oftenshocking developments, Jihadi: A Love Story is an intelligent thriller thatasks big questions.My verdictJihadi is an intelligently written novel that wasn't always an easy read, mainly because of the vivid descriptions that shocked and evoked some powerful emotions. It's definitely a book that needs to be read slowly, so you can digest it one step at a time.Yusuf Toropov has written a very modern highly-topical novel focusing on a former US intelligence agent who has been accused of terrorism. But this isn't a straightforward 'innocent or guilty' story - his memoir is being read and annotated by a seemingly unstable psychologist with an agenda of their own. At first, readers may struggle with the two voices, but it soon becomes clear how they are connected and why there is conflict.Jihadi is intriguing, addictive, brutal, gripping, tragic and brilliant, with several strands that come together seamlessly by the end of the book. It's written in an almost-rhythmic way that enabled me to get inside the characters' heads. Yet it left me unsure who to trust or believe. Maybe the true account isn't really the true account at all. And will anyone ever know the truth?The book is subtitled 'A Love Story' but it made me question who this 'love' was between. Lovers? Husbands and wives? Parents and children? Friends? Colleagues? People and their religion, government or country? The book demonstrates how propaganda can cause conflict and distort the truth - and how people (from both sides) can be manipulated to believe whatever they are being led to believe - whether it's the truth or not. This is also a book about faith and belief - in people, our country, ourselves... - and how both can deceive our judgement and influence our actions.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.Click here to read Snarky Cat's interview with Yusuf Toropov.Follow the Blog Tour"},

On her own, she's a disaster. With Noel, she's ateam.Togetherthey cook up an idea. But there are plenty of other people making money out ofthe war and some of them are dangerous. Noel may have been moved to safety, buthe isn't actually safe at all . . .My verdictCrooked Heart is a gorgeous easy read, showing an alternative side of wartime London.Ten-year-old Noel lives with his godmother Mattie, who gives him a slightly alternative education with her suffragette views. Noel doesn't fit in well with his classmates - he's a thinker, dreamer and loner, usually found with his head in a book. When Mattie succumbs to dementia, Noel is evacuated to St Albans to live with the slightly crooked Vera (Vee) Sedge (who sees him as a money-making scheme) and her rather naive son Donald.Crooked Heart is funny, poignant and charming, with gorgeous characters that you can't help but love, from Noel and Mattie to Vee and Donald. I loved the flourishing friendship between Noel and Vee - and how two very different people find a common bond. I also found the book's social history background fascinating - the story of evacuees and how they were sent to live with complete strangers, even in the London suburbs/Hertfordshire (which are not that far away from central London).This is a book that will stay with me for some time. It's the story of a boy who's grieving, lost and alone in the world, and a woman who needs more focus in her life. I love how all the characters change and grow throughout the book, and feel more complete and content by the end.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},

Rina's teenage years weren't easy, with plenty of exposure to sex, drugs and violence at a young age, so it's not surprising that she learns very quickly how to survive. But she's also very loyal to her family and anyone who needs her help.There are some great characters and plenty of action, shocks and twists to keep the reader intrigued.

So Lizzy thinks. Then, one day, Lizzy finds a letterfrom a stranger to her father, and discovers he has another child. Lizzyinvites her into their world in an act of outraged defiance. Almostimmediately, she realises her mistake.My verdictLook at Me is an intriguing psychological tale of family upheaval and relationships. How grief can make you act irrationally. And how it's difficult to move on until you come to terms with the past.Two years after the death of her mother Margaret, Lizzy, her father Julian and brother Ig are still struggling with cope with their loss. When Lizzy discovers her father Julian has an illegitimate child, she welcomes her half-sister Eunice into the family with open arms. But Eunice doesn't take long to worm her way into their home, and into their lives, and soon discovers that family life with Margaret wasn't quite as rosy as everyone has been led to believe.Look at Me is a beautifully written haunting tale. But it's also a slow burner so don't expect a fast-paced read. The book isn't very long, but its 200 or so pages are filled with sadness, gentle humour and thought-provoking revelations. Eunice is particularly unnerving, as at first you're not quite sure whether she's genuine or not. None of the characters are particularly likeable but they're certainly quirky and this family won't be forgotten easily.This is a book that may not appeal to everyone. But I loved it.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

My friends love me, I'm sure of it.But that doesn't mean they didn't try to kill me. Does it?My verdict13 Minutes is a Young Adult psychological thriller, but certainly doesn't read like a Young Adult book at all. Sarah Pinborough has a talent for getting right into the heart of her characters' emotions.This is the story of a group of 16-year-old girls - their fickle and fragile friendships, their pent-up feelings and their need to fit in (or not fit in).Tasha is found in water and then revived. She was clinically dead for 13 minutes. But she has no idea why or how she ended up there - or who can provide some answers. But as she delves into the past few weeks, she discovers that something was bubbling under the surface and her friends may not be as trustworthy as they seem.This is a beautifully written book. It's impossible not to get engrossed into the girls' lives - it all seems very real and very vivid. The plot is intriguing, chilling and tragic, and will keep you guessing right until the last page.I loved Sarah Pinborough's The Death House. 13 Minutes is sure to be another winner.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Historical Research - a guest post by Rebecca Mascull - Blog Tour ", "date": "Thursday 18 February 2016", "text": "I would like to welcome Rebecca Mascull to my blog today, as part of her blog tour. Rebecca's book Song of the Sea Maid was published in paperback by Hodder & Stoughton on 11 February 2016. Historical Research - what do I need to know?By Rebecca MascullBy the time I started planning my second published novel,Song of the Sea Maid, I’d been writing novels for over a decade. Yep, I’dwritten a few novels before The Visitors was published. And in that time, I’dtaught myself to research, write and edit historical novels. So it wasn’t timewasted…So, what did I learn? The first thing I had to get my headround when writing about a different historical period to the one I’m livingthrough, was research. The question is, what do I need to know? When I firststarted out, I was writing a novel set during the Second World War. I thoughtat first that I basically needed to know EVERYTHING, that if I knew EVERYTHINGthen I could pick and choose what I wanted to put in the novel from theEVERYTHING I knew. A fine ambition. And in those days, I had quite a bit oftime to try to achieve that ambition. It was before I had my daughter, and I’dgiven up teaching for a year to see if I could write this historical novel. So,I set about finding out about WW2. And, of course, I realised pretty quicklythat it would take me the rest of my life to find out about one little part ofWW2 and I still wouldn’t finish it. So I set about narrowing down what I reallyneeded to know and I started to dismiss all the stuff I’d love to know but justdidn’t have time for.I refined this process over the years and it’s saved me alot of time and a lot of money in book buying, I tell you. When I startedplanning Song of the Sea Maid, one of the first things I did was to write alist of all the areas of knowledge I’d need to look into in order to write mycharacter Dawnay’s story. She’s an orphan, born in the 1730s, who becomes ascientist, travels to Portugal and beyond, then makes a remarkable discovery.So, what did I need to know about? My list started something like this:C18thScienceThen I thought – wait a minute here – you can’t just learneverything about the C18th and everything about science. So, I narrowed itdown. Dawnay was born in the 1730s and the story follows her through into thelate 1750s. That narrows it down a bit. And what science is she going topractise? Well, she’s mostly concerned with the big question: where do we comefrom? So, there’s palaeoanthropology for starters. Don’t need any books on molecularchemistry then. But what did scientists know about palaeoanthropology in theC18th, if anything?? So, I added a new one to the list:Scientists in the C18thThen, I realised that Dawnay was not just any old scientistin the C18th, but that rare breed, a female scientist. Society was differentthen, of course it was, anyone knows that. Women had it tough, tougher thantoday. So, another one for the list:Female scientists in the C18thSo, you can see how the process of research becomes about anact of refining. Funnily enough, once I continued this list with all the otherthings I needed to learn about – for example: OrphanagesThe age of sailPortugal and MenorcaThe Seven Years’ War- well, that’ll do for now, as I don’t want to give the wholestory away…Anyway, once I’d written my list, I realised that it was all verywell knowing all this stuff, but what I really wanted to know about, where Ireally wanted to start, was not actually street life in C18th London or whatC18th gentleman knew about fossils BUT actually, I really wanted to know aboutDawnay. She was the whole reason I was writing this story, her story. I wanted to create a character that I cared about (infact, she was already there in my head, arms crossed, feet tapping, waiting forme to get the hell on with it – and she’d be most annoyed at the suggestion I’d‘created’ her – characters are like that. A bit uppity and full of themselves,once they get going.) So, I didn’t start with all the details of C18th life, suchas what knickers C18th women wore (though this is rather fascinating: theanswer is none). Instead, I let Dawnay tell me about herself – a bit ofchannelling, as it were – and it soon became obvious that what ruled herpersonality was her obsession with science. She had a scientist’s mind, she sawthe world through the lens of science. So, one of the first books I read wasRichard Feynman’s autobiography, all about what he was like when he was a kid,the way he saw the world, how he fixed people’s radios and tried to improve thecommunication system in the hotel that was his first job. I’m no scientist andI don’t have a scientific brain, so I was learning what it’s like to be one. Itwas the most valuable research I did, as it allowed me to climb into Dawnay’smind. I had my gal. Now I could place her, a bit like a chess piece, into herera – into C18th London – and watch her walk around in it. Now, what were C18thstreets like? How did she get around? What did she wear and eat? How did shetalk?And I was off. That’s where the fun really starts…Song of the Sea MaidPublished by Hodder & Stoughton on 11 February 2016SynopsisIn the 18thcentury, Dawnay Price is an anomaly.

The siren call of scienceis powerful, but as war approaches she finds herself pulled in anotherdirection by feelings she cannot control.My verdictSong of the Sea Maid is a beautifully written story, set against a fascinating historical and philosophical background.This stunning novel is more than just a love story, as it explores what it was like to be a woman in the 18th century. Dawnay Price is an anomaly in a world where women don't study science - especially women from a lowly background. But thanks to her high intelligence, sheer persistence and enquiring mind, she's determined to make something of herself from a very young age. Dawnay is given the opportunity to travel to Portugal, on an adventure of a lifetime, to explore previously unchartered territory and the science of ancient civilisations. But war and the environment appear to be against her.Song of the Sea Maid is so well researched and vividly portrayed that I felt like I had been transported back in time. I could hear the sounds, taste the food and see the sights of Lisbon and the Iberian Peninsula, as if I was part of it too. The characters felt very real and I struggled to put the book down, reading most of it in one sitting. I read the last few chapters in tears and felt very lost when it ended.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},

They includemy mother, my father, my little sister, my grandmother, my other grandmother,my grandfather, my boss, my sixth year Biology teacher and my boyfriend James.When LeahOliphant-Brotheridge and her adopted sister Su go on holiday together toMagaluf to celebrate their A-levels, only Leah returns home. Her successful,swotty sister remains abroad, humiliated and afraid: there is an online videoof her, drunkenly performing a sex act in a nightclub. And everyone has seenit.RuthOliphant-Brotheridge, mother of the girls, successful court judge, is furious.How could this have happened? How can she bring justice to these men who tookadvantage of her dutiful, virginal daughter? What role has Leah played in allthis? And can Ruth find Su and bring her back home when Su doesn't want to befound?READ THE EXTRACTRuth Oliphant was used to wearing a wig. Usually it was short, grey, hadthree curls above each ear, cost £2,000 (according to the Daily Record ), andcomplemented her classic black skirt and red robe. The wig she had on now wasbright pink, bob-shaped, straight bangs, and it complemented her low-cut slinkyblack dress and the pink ‘Hen Party’ sash which crossed her torso and back. Forfifty-two, she was pretty damn hot. Good skin from years of water-drinkinghealthy-living. Slim, toned body from years of organic-only vegetarianism aswell as a twenty-mile round-trip cycle from home in Doon to the court inKilbarchie. People laughed that she cycled to work in Lycra, showering andreappearing in ‘My Lady’ clobber. She wasn’t the only Hen in the jam-packed club, but she was the only oneover the age of twenty-five, the only one without a gaggle of at least tenothers with an identical sash, and probably the only one who was about to spikea man’s drink. ‘Think you’ve got the wrong place, lady. The bingo’s two doors down.’ ‘Does an attractive cougar threaten you?’ She sipped her ‘Multiple Orgasm’as sensually as she could, leaning forwards to show some cleavage.‘What makes you think you’re attractive?’ He wasn’t looking at her face whenhe said this, so it was working. ‘The fact that I am.’ It had taken a long time to find this man and Ruth’squest to find him had been as mercurial as her plan once she did. ‘Can I wear your wig?’ He stroked her pink hair and looked into her eyes butdidn’t recognise her.She smiled at his glorious stupidity and slipped a pillinto his beer. No, she would not let him wear her wig.*She’d been in the afternoon’s custody court when her husband phoned. Wig on,she’d sat through three breaches of the peace, one of them a domestic, anassault to injury, a dangerous driving, a housebreaking, and a few more thatshe can’t recall now. She was in a good mood by the end of the afternoonsession, she remembered that much. Michael MacDonald was defending a few of thecases, and he’d always entertained her, since the first time she’d seen him incourt. It was two years ago, and he was defending an unusually dapper man inhis early twenties. Ruth had studied the defendant – his designer suit jarredwith his tacky billiard ball ring – and had thereafter thought of him as ‘Theguy behind the 8-ball’. ‘The defendant experienced a spontaneous and unprecedented moment of rage,’Michael had said, ‘when he came home and found his partner had cut his designershirts into tiny little pieces. One of the shirts was a Louis Vuitton worth£450.’ The guy behind the 8-ball had expressed his rage by setting fire to hispartner’s dog. Silver Fox didn’t argue hard on this occasion. Like most people,animal cruelty upset him more than violence against women and he did notconsider appealing against the eighteen-month custodial. It was a memorablecase for Ruth, watching Silver Fox in action for the first time, but alsobecause of the threats the guy behind the 8-ball hurled at Ruth from the cellsbelow her afterwards: ‘I’ll get you for this, bitch’; ‘I know where you live’;‘You’d better watch out’. Ruth decided to ignore the muffled noise, confident thatthe guards would quieten him, and continued the session.Shortly after this first encounter with Silver Fox, Ruth was surprised tosee him singing in the East Kilbride Gilbert and Sullivan Society’s performanceof the Pirates of Penzance. She had to admit he was the very model of a modernmajor gen-eral. He was exceptionally charismatic, and never more so than today,it seemed. Ruth would never smile in court, but she found this difficult as hespoke about the last defendant of the session, a short and painfully thintwenty-one-year-old man called Barry Andrew Malone, who had somehow man-aged tofind a suit three sizes too small. ‘Mr Malone suffers from Oppositional Defiant Disorder, My Lady.’ MacDonaldgestured towards the glaikit defen-dant, whose grey suit sleeves ended threeinches before his yellowing shirt and who looked like he wanted to puncheveryone in the room. ‘This is a recognised condition which means he finds itdifficult to comply with requests and is often argumentative. In layman’s terms,My Lady, Mr Malone has been diagnosed as clinically naughty. On the afternoonin question he was suffering quite badly from naughtiness and did not wish towait in the queue at Greggs the Bakers on Queen Street. My Lady, the defendantwas in dire need of a cheese and onion pasty at the time of the allegedincident. It was 3 p.m., M’Lady, and he’d had no breakfast and no lunch. Thealleged victim confronted him, saying . . .’ MacDonald pushed a flop of silverhair away from his face as he leant down to read the transcript: ‘Wait ya turn,ya knob.’ Head and hair upright again, MacDonald continued. ‘My Lady, at thispoint, I’m afraid the psychological disorder reared its ugly head, which asI’ve explained is outwith my client’s control and My Lady, this is why MrMalone used his elbow to shove the alleged victim, a Ms Ellen Dalkeith, who wasfirst in the queue at Greggs on the afternoon in question and hoping topurchase two strawberry tarts.’ Ruth bit her lip to suppress a smile and spoke flatly and without lookingup. ‘He’s pleading not guilty?’‘Yes, My Lady.’ As requested by Sheriff Ruth Oliphant, the defendant stood, revealing suittrousers that bulged painfully at the groin and ground his teeth as trial dateswere announced by the clerk of court. Ruth gathered her papers as everyonestood and lowered their heads. She exited via the back door, and giggled allthe way to her chambers.There were two messages from her husband on her mobile. 1: Ruth, call me assoon as you can. 2: Ruth, my darling, I’m in the car park across the road andI’ll still be here when you’re done.

{"title": "On Being An Author by Laura Wilkinson - Redemption Song Blog Tour", "date": "Tuesday 9 February 2016", "text": "I would like to welcome Laura Wilkinson to my blog today, as part of her blog tour. Laura's book Redemption Song is being published by Accent Press in 28 January 2016. On Being an AuthorA question often asked of authors is: What’s the best thingabout the job?There are many positives to choose from – and manynot-so-nice, but we’ll gloss over those for the time being. For me, one of thebest things is the journey of discovery you embark upon when you begin a novel:finding the story, meeting the characters, getting to know them are theheadlines but I love finding out about all manner of incidental details;subjects I would never have learnt about had I not had to for the sake ofcharacter or plot; and it is the people I meet along the journey that isanother great perk.My last novel, PublicBattles, Private Wars, required huge amounts of research (you can read about it here if you wish) but all books requiresome digging around. For Redemption SongI had to learn about medical training – Saffron is training to be a doctor –all about bats (Joe is a keen bat watcher and conservationist; did you knowthey were a protected species? I didn’t); I had to study the Baptist faith(Rain is a committed Christian) as well as details of sentencing for certaincrimes and small details of police procedure and legalities. And while there isa lot to be learnt from reading the internet and studying books from your locallibrary (remember that way of researching?), there’s nothing to beat talking withexperts.I am consistently overwhelmed by people’s generosity. Put ashout-out on Facebook or Twitter and relative strangers will come forward withoffers of help or contact details. And then there are those who give up theirtime to meet, to talk with you and share their experiences and knowledge.Amazeballs. For Redemption Song aminister and his wife welcomed me, a non-believer, into their church and theirhome. They gave up hours to answer all manner of questions, many of which musthave sounded incredibly stupid. I met with a doctor who shared his experiences,a bat conservationist who gave up a Sunday morning, and I spoke with apoliceman who couldn’t reveal his identity because of the nature of his role inthe force. He did, however, share his time and expertise. The same is true ofmy legal expert. And then there are the authors who gave up their time to readearly drafts of the book and then those who read an uncorrected proof and gaveendorsements that were so generous they brought a tear to my eye. The best thing about being a writer? It’s not the money*hahaha* or the fame *laughing even harder now*, it’s the lovely, lovely peopleI might never have met were it not for this book. Now that is a benefit.Redemption SongPublished by Accent Press on 28thJanuary 2016SynopsisIf you lost everything in one night, what would you do?Saffron is studying for a promising career in medicine untila horrific accident changes her life for ever.

I am delighted that WENDY HOLDEN is joining me on my blog today as my Author in the Spotlight. Wendy's book - Born Survivors - was published by Sphere in October 2015. Please tell us about your latest book?Born Survivors tells the story of threeyoung women pregnant by their husbands during World War Two and praying for abrighter future. Their babies were born weighing just three pounds within weeksof each other in the most horrendous of circumstances. By the time theyarrived, the Nazis had killed their fathers and their mothers were ‘walkingskeletons,’ living moment to moment in the same concentration camp. Somehow,all three women managed to survive. Against all the odds, their babies did too.Seventy years on and now living in America and Britain, these ‘siblings of theheart’ have come together for the first time to tell the remarkable stories ofthe three mothers who defied death to give them life. It has been published in21 countries and translated into 16 languages so far. Without doubt, it is themost important book I will ever write.How did you come across the story?By luck. I was reading something late onenight online about a woman who had died in Canada in her 90s. She had been aprisoner in Auschwitz – just like my three mothers –and had given birth to ababy there, which had died. It occurred to me then that I have never readanything about babies born in concentration camps and my research led me to EvaClarke and her mother Anka. She lived just over one hour from me in Cambridge,England, and having spent an emotional day with her I asked if she would do methe honour of letting me write her mother’s story. She reached out, touched myarm, and with tears in her eyes said: “I have been waiting for you for 70years.” I told her I believe her story to be unique and that I have never foundanything written about babies born in the Holocaust before. She told me thatuntil 2010, she believed she was unique too but then discovered two otherbabies in America and they had since become very close. I knew then that I hadto tell all three stories together in one volume spanning the war in Europe andHitler’s attempted destruction of the Jews.Why are you so interested in history andwar?I grew up in a family that had been deeplyaffected by war. My father fought the Japanese in Burma and my mother’s fiancéwas killed aged 19 parachuting into Germany. She also lived through the LondonBlitz. Then when I became a journalist, for a while I was a war correspondentfor the London Daily Telegraph and travelled all over the world coveringconflicts. The experience scarred me and I suffered from a mild form of PTSDfollowing my return to England. What struck me most about all that I had seen,though, were the great acts of courage and kindness that people were capable ofeven in the worst possible circumstances, or perhaps because of them.What other books have you written aboutwar?Tomorrow to Be Brave tells the true storyof Susan Travers, the only woman in the French Foreign Legion and was publishedglobally. Behind Enemy Lines tells Marthe Cohn’s remarkable story of being aJewish spy who risked her life after losing a sister to Auschwitz and herfiancé to a firing squad. Till the Sun Grows Cold tells the story of Britishteacher Emma McCune who married a Sudanese warlord and was then killed whilecarrying his baby. Kill Switch is the memoir of a British army major who waswrongly imprisoned in Afghanistan for a crime he didn’t commit. Biting theBullet told the story of what it was like to be married to the SAS. Shell Shockdetails the story of the mind at war and how the experiences of soldiers at thefront shaped modern-day psychiatry. Mr Scraps is a novella about a stray dogcaught up in the London Blitz. The Sense of Paper was my first novel and tellsof a former war correspondent haunted by her experiences, who loses herself inthe work and materials of JMW Turner to try to reconcile herself with theghosts of her past.What or who inspires you?Finding humanity in inhumanity. Generosity.Kindness. Thoughtfulness. And of course, fine writing. I only hope that one dayI can come a little closer to what some of my personal heroes have alreadyachieved.If not a writer, what job would you do?If I had my time again, I’d take a fine artdegree and put my fledgling and entirely amateur ability as an artist –inherited from my grandfather - to much better use.What does Holocaust Memorial Day mean toyou?Because ofmy own history and my interest in war, I have always marked these importantanniversaries and memorial days in quiet reflection of the things I havewitnessed and of those whose lives I have written about. I was raised aChristian although I rarely go to church these days but my father always taughtme that we could be ‘Christian with a small c’ and try to be good peoplewithout having to kneel before any altar. This year will be especially poignantfor me and the ‘babies’ after the worldwide publication of Born Survivors.

{"title": "Why locations count by David Mark, author of Dead Pretty - an author guest post", "date": "Tuesday 26 January 2016", "text": "I would like to welcome David Mark to my blog today, to talk about the importance of locations in his DS McAvoy novels. DS McAvoy novels have brought readers from all over the world to the streets of Hull - the same streets David walked as a crime journalist. The David's 5th DS McAvoy book Dead Pretty is being published by Mulholland Books on 28 January 2016. Why locations countBy David MarkI’m not very good at remembering stock answers to thequestions that novelists tend to get asked.When people query where I get myideas from, or why I’ve made my lead character a Scottish giant, or whether I’mas angry as they are about the casting decisions in Jack Reacher, I don’treally have anything to trot out. So when people ask me why I write about Hull,I actually stop to think about it. I ponder. I stroke my chin and treat myselfto some deep cogitation. Then, like all authors, I ask Google. I did that foryou, just now. I typed ‘Hull’ into the search engine, and the local newspaperheadlines flashed up. The second item involved a naked man assaulting threepolice officers on the Bransholme estate when they warned him to stop jumpingon cars. “Ah,” I thought, nodding sagely. “That’s why.”Location isn’t always crucial to the success of a novel.Conan Doyle did just as well when he took Sherlock travelling as he did when heleft him in Baker Street. Jane Marple regularly ventured out of the comfort ofSt Mary Mead and Jack Reacher has made a career out of behaving like theLittlest Hobo and turning up wherever Lee Child feels like dropping him. It’s different for me, and my central character, AectorMcAvoy. I write what Amazon loves to refer to as ‘police procedurals’. Inessence, that means my main protagonist is a serving policeman rather than anamateur or some poor bystander who gets caught up in the mix. I write about aDetective Sergeant on the murder squad in Hull. Why? Well, Oxford was taken. Sotoo was Edinburgh. Bergerac has got Jersey sewn up and it would be arrogant tothink I could do Nottingham better than John Harvey. And, to be fair, I know nextto naff all about any of those cities. The thing is, when I wrote the first McAvoy book I hadn’tseen a great deal of the world. I’m from Carlisle, which is a perfectly fineplace to be from, but I left there at 18 and my memories tend to be those of amiserable teenager with purple hair who thought the world would get better ifpeople got behind new Labour leader John Smith …I’ve been a journalist in a few other towns, but I wouldn’tcall myself anything other than vaguely familiar with the geography. I know thestreets of Nottingham a bit. I know how to get from Bella Italia to my oldbedsit without getting shot and I know how to get in through the deliveryentrance at the Evening Post building without being seen so I could sneak to mydesk and pretend I’d been there for hours. But that’s hardly enough of aconnection to make it the setting for my books. The simple truth is, I set my books in Hull because it’s theonly place I can imagine those stories being set. I came to Hull in 2000 towork for the Yorkshire Post and knew it as a punchline. As far as I wasconcerned it was a fish shop 50 miles down a railway siding and it was to be nomore than a stepping stone on my way to bigger and better things. Trouble is, Hull is fascinating. If you have a relativelyartistic and enquiring soul, you can’t help but be seduced by the place. Thearchitecture is extraordinary. The history oozes through the cobbles likedaisies and slime.  The people talk funnyand the men who drink in the Old Town pubs are full of stories about how theysaw their best friend’s head taken off by the trawl doors 70 miles off theNorwegian coast in 1964. Perhaps it was simply the fact that it was where I spentmost time as a journalist. I got to know the courts and the police stations. Isat in the living rooms of grieving wives, mothers, husbands and fathers andlooked at their family albums as they told me of the agonies their loved oneshad endured at the hands of the monsters who snatched their lives. I knew thecoppers. I knew the geography, I knew which pubs my fictional characters wouldbe most likely to drink in and what McAvoy would need to wear if he was goingto be staking out a building off Cleveland street (there’s a viciouscross-wind). Familiarity, then? A simple, pragmatic approach to location?I know Hull, so I’ll set it there. Perhaps. But in truth, and I may have to geta bit existential here, I think McAvoy was destined for hull before I even methim. I can’t picture him anywhere else. I can’t imagine his boss, Trish, livinganywhere other than her little semi-detached in Grimsby. When the accused is inthe dock, he’s in the dock at Hull Crown Court – feet from where I used to sitscribbling down their denials and lies. All told, it’s probably a little of everything. My books arebased in Hull but they may not always stay there. As I see more of the world Imight take McAvoy to new locations. I might not. For now, Hull is where McAvoycalls ‘home’. It’s a city I know; a city that fascinates, intrigues andinspires. But even if my accountant could swing the research flights with HMRC,I wouldn’t feel comfortable setting the same stories in Barbados. The air wouldfeel wrong. The clouds wouldn’t move the right way. The people wouldn’t takethe way they do in my imagination. And more importantly, McAvoy’s freckly skinwould burn in the sun.Dead PrettyBy David MarkPublished by Mulholland Books (28 January 2016)SynopsisHannahKelly has been missing for nine months.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Eva Dolan - Blog Tour", "date": "Sunday 24 January 2016", "text": "I am delighted that EVA DOLAN is joining me on my blog today as my Author in the Spotlight, as part of her Blog Tour. Eva's book - After You Die - was published by Harvill Secker on 14 January 2016. What was the original inspiration behind the charactersand setting of your novels? The characters came fully formed when I realised I was goingto be setting the series in a Hate Crimes department. I conceived it assomething of a dumping ground - sorry Zigic and Ferreira! - a unit created forpolitical reasons, the local constabulary's way of proving that they weretaking the newly passed Hate Crimes laws seriously. Thinking about what kind ofofficers would be placed there I decided it would be staffed by people ofimmigrant backgrounds, those sensitive to the community's challenges andsuffering, ones who would speak the languages they would encounter and beregarded as more approachable than 'English' coppers.So Zigic is a third-generation Serb - essentially English inall but name. While Ferreira came to the UK as a child from Portugal and hasgrown up in a migrant community. As a result she is more sympathetic to victimsand far less tolerant of aggressors.Peterborough felt like the perfect location to drop thisteam into because it has seen such a high influx of migrants in recent years,something the locals haven't adapted well to, leading to a lot of social uneaseand political tension.After You Die moves the action out of those streets, though,and into a pretty commuter village on the edge of the city. It's affluent,comfortable, the kind of place my detectives rarely find themselves working butcrime they encounter is as brutal and callous as any they've investigatedpreviously.The community dynamic is quite important within the widercontext of the plots - what research or experience allowed you to make it feelso authentic? Part of the reason I moved After You Die out to a villagewas that I wanted to explore a different kind of community and the dynamicswithin it. For the first two books I was writing about relatively closed-offgroups, separated by culture and language, their families and friends leftbehind in other countries. Getting the feel right was largely a matter oftalking to migrant workers and seeing how they felt about their new lives inEngland, there was just no other way to get that sense of authenticity.With After You Die it was a much simpler proposition becauseI've always lived in villages like the one I've used. And, oddly, there is lessof a sense of community. Anywhere around Peterborough with high property pricesand that feeling of, perhaps, slightly smug, aloofness, is generally occupiedby London commuters, people who work long hours and have very little to do withmost of their neighbours. So, instead, you get these cliques, very close, almostincestuous, groups who know everything about one another and not much aboutanyone else. Still, gossip thrives and murder tends to shake peoples' belief inthe safety of their own lives.After You Die finds our pair investigating something alittle different from the previous two stories - what made you decide to branchout and do you think you will continue to expand THEIR experiences? Being based in a Hate Crimes Unit the series is, bydefinition, solely concerned with crimes which are motivated by racial orreligious prejudice, homophobia and transphobia, or in this casedisability-related harassment. I felt like I'd already dug deep into the moreovertly political crimes in the previous books and wanted to switch to a morefamily-based, personal one this time. Disability-related hate crimes are actually horribly common- Mencap suggests that around 90% of disabled people will be targeted in theirlifetime - and yet we hear very little about this in comparison to racism oreven homophobia. I wanted to bring this matter to light and explore how itaffects those suffering, people who are already some of the most vulnerable inour society, dealing with the daily challenges of their disability.Without giving spoilers...the investigation resonates particularlywith Ferreira, who is struggling with the aftermath of injuries sustained inthe line of duty and it was interesting, as an author, seeing how she wouldcope. Zigic and Ferreira are developing from book to book in ways I didn'texpect. They have their secrets and I'm still uncovering them as I go along. Idon't like to know too much about my main characters, I'd rather investigatethem as the stories develop. Describe your writing style in 10 words or less? Argh, I can't do that! Nobody really knows what theirwriting style is. We need readers and critics to tell us that. I hope I writerelatively elegantly, as a reader I prefer spare, well balanced prose and it'swhat I aspire to stylistically.Do you have any strange writing habits? Strange, me? I'm quite a superstitious writer. I won'tdiscuss what I'm working on until it's finished because it's such a weird,random process that I feel talking about it somehow breaks the spell. I onlyever write at night now as well, having found I can do the same amount of workin four dark hours as nine daylight ones. It's just so much quieter, no onlinedistractions, no psychic background hum. It's easier to access yoursubconscious after midnight for some reason.Who are your favourite authors? Crime wise - I'm not doing this because there are too manylist and I'll inevitably forget someone.Non-crime - Cormac McCarthy, Irvine Welsh, Margaret Atwood,Graham Greene, Richard Yates, Emile Zola, Honore de Balzac, Stefan Zweig. Icould go on all day...If you were writing a book about your life, what wouldthe title be? Something punning? Isn't that the law? I'm rubbish at puns.If only Hunter S Thompson hadn't already taken 'The Rum Diary.' I don't think anyone would read a writer's life story either.Maybe Graham Greene's or James Ellroy's. Mine, not so much. 'Got up, didmessages, ate toast, wrote some stuff.'I'd probably go for '24/7 Pjs' as a nod to the writer'suniform.Also, I'd want the audio book version read by Kathy Burkebecause we sound quite similar.What advice would you give your younger self? Don't sleep in your make-up! What advice do you have for aspiring authors? Read loads. Talk to weird people. Develop a rhino skin and adrink problem and always make sure you're nicely turned out.And lastly, why should people read After You Die?Because it's an important issue, which doesn't get enoughattention, explored through the suffering of a very strong and eloquentteenaged girl who has fought to have her voice heard against a barrage ofonline trolls who want to silence her work as a right-to-die advocate. It'salso a story about families and how they cope in the aftermath of tragedy.Secrets, lies, affairs, murder; all that good crime stuff.About Eva DolanEvaDolan is anEssex-based copywriter and intermittently successful poker player.

Fiona's book Rattle is being published by Pan Macmillan in January 2017. FICTION VERSUS NON-FICTION AKA HOW THE F**K CAN I SQUEEZE INALL MY WORK  *AND*  FINISH MY NOVEL?On the day my children went back to school after theChristmas holidays, I was out of the door at 8am, heading into London to workon a magazine for a supermarket client.   Exactly twelvehours later, I fell back through the door, read my sleepy-eyed lovelies abedtime story and collapsed on the sofa.   Of course, the lastthing I felt like doing was writing, every ounce of creativity squeezed from meby a day of train journeys and the confines of an office, dreaming up differentways to describe Easter eggs.   But fuelled by abottle of beer and a bowl of stew, I opened up my laptop and the word documentcurrently called Book Two, and met up with some new friends (and no, I don'tmean on Twitter).   Last week, I foundmyself at a children's birthday party, one of a handful of parents whose littleones wanted them to stay. As soon as my five-year-old was pass-the-parcellingwith gusto, I opened up a memo on my mobile and started working on this blog.   Fiction versusnon-fiction. Novels versus journalism. How does one juggle two very differentdisciplines amid the chaos of family life?   The answer, for meat least, lies in the scenarios I have outlined above.    I don't.        Instead, I jugglemy time in a flippin'-heck-this-piece-is-due-in-two-days-better-get-my-head-downkind of way.   In newspapers (Iworked at the Daily Mirror for 12 years), deadlines have a way of focussingone's mind which is all well and good if an article is, say, 1000 words long,but what happens when the word count is 100,000, the deadline several monthsaway?   In truth, I'm stillfinding out.   Yes, I've scaledback my journalism since signing a two-book deal for my début crime thriller RATTLEand its sequel, thanks to generous advances from Pan Macmillan and my foreignpublishers.   But so many writersnever get beyond their first deal, and it's the terrifying prospect of a bookthat doesn't sell that keeps me working for a handful of clients.  In my fantasy life,I wave my kids off at the school gates, work on my novel for three hours or so,and head to the gym at lunchtime. Afternoons are spent dealing with admin,social media and my non-fiction commissions until it's pick-up time, when I'llplay educational games and cook a nutritious meal.  In reality, I gazeinto space for quite a long time. I go on Twitter. I eat biscuits. I tap out afew lines. Then I realise I have to collect my children in ten minutes and I'veforgotten to buy any dinner. Fast-forward a few hours, and I'm working untilmidnight.  Oh, and I've put ontwo stone.  But every day I'mdiscovering more about the way I write: that my fiction is freshest in themorning, when tiredness, the drought that sucks me dry, has lifted, and thewords fall like rain; that interviews and news stories, with their ready-madecontent and dialogue, their rhythm and structure, are easier to write at theend of a long day than complex plots and made-up characters; that I tend towrite my books in the gaps between my life, on a winter Sunday afternoon, asnatched hour after tea, in the hushed darkness of a cinema, a car, a traincarriage, a café.    I guess what I'msaying is, like most writers, I'm just trying to find my way, and fiction ornon-fiction, novel or newspaper, as long as the words deserve their place onthe page, the route doesn't matter.  About Fiona CumminsFiona Cummins is an award-winning former Daily Mirrorshowbusiness journalist who writes for national publications and corporateclients.

Dawn was killed in a vicious stabbing in her own kitchen, while Holly was left to die upstairs.After You Die reads as a whodunnit - who could be callous enough to leave a disabled teenager to die of neglect in this way? The investigation isn't sensationalised or drawn out, as seen in some crime fiction, and I found it hard to put the book down.

Kate's book - The Girl in the Red Coat - was published in paperback by Faber & Faber on 24 December 2015. The Girl in the Red Coat has fairytale qualities, albeitdark ones. What inspired you to write it?It all began with a central image I had – of a girl standingin a dark forest and wearing a red duffel coat. It had quite a spooky feel andI knew somehow she was lost. Although I wasn’t consciously trying to write ‘atwenty-first century fairytale’ those stories have always been important to me.I still have the copy of Grimm’s that I devoured over and over again as a child.These stories are not sugar coated – betrayal, murder, jealousy, loss – thereal fairytales are strong meat and that’s what’s always drawn me to them.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less.Instinctive. Striving for a simplicity of language.Do you have any strange writing habits?Like many authors I read my work out loud, so if talking toyourself is counted as a strange habit then, yes. When I’m trying to describe amovement I often make shapes with my hands to help as well. Just as well I’m notoverlooked really…!Are you a plotter or a pantser? Do you plot out the wholebook before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?A bit of both really. I seem to have developed the techniqueof writing the beginning, knowing two or three major plot points along the wayand writing the last paragraph or page – all very early on. I guess this is myoutline. I did it with ‘The Girl in the Red Coat,’ the current novel I’mworking on and the next one I’ve got tucked away so it seems like it’s becominga bit of a method.Who are your favourite authors?Maggie O’Farrell. Edna O’Brien. Helen Dunmore. Marcus Zusak.Graham Greene. Erin Kelly. Kazuo Ishiguro. Ian McEwan. M.L. Stedman. These areall firm favourites. I’ve also come across some amazing authors for the firsttime this year like Susan Barker and the wonderful, singing language of Petina Gappah in herdebut ‘The Book of Memory.’ Also Nicole Krauss – she is the most extraordinarywriter I’ve read in a long time.If you were writing a book about your life, what would thetitle be?Boy, seriously I think this is the hardest question I’veever been asked! It would probably change every day. Today it would be ‘Womanin Yellow Dress Sits at Desk and Rewrites Chapter Three Times.’What advice would you give your younger self?Oh, the usual – have a little confidence probably. Whenyou’re young you think everyone knows exactly what they’re doing. Theunderstanding that they’re mostly winging it just like you are is veryliberating.What advice do you have for aspiring writers. Write the story that is yours, the one that burns insideyou. The stuff that makes you go ‘uh oh, that’s a bit strange/unusual/where didthat come from?’ – go with that. Don’t chase trends. Be true to yourself. Don’tshow anyone your work until it’s finished. Don’t discuss it either, it’lldeflate you. The story is the only and important thing.Do you have another book in the pipeline?I’ve just finished the first draft of my second novel andI’m working hard getting it into shape. It’s a coming of age tale again with avery healthy dose of the supernatural.And lastly, why should people read The Girl in the RedCoatI don’t know if that’s for me to say. I guess if anythingI’d like people to know that as well as a crime book or a psychologicalthriller, more than anything, it’s a book about love.About Kate HamerKate Hamergrew up in Pembrokeshire.

Her parents are rich and influential, as are the friends they were withat their holiday home by the sea.But whatreally happened to Coco?Over twointense weekends - the first when Coco goes missing and the second twelve yearslater at the funeral of her father - the darkest of secrets will gradually berevealed...My verdictWow, The Darkest Secret is an incredibly powerful read and a twisty totally-terrifying psychological thriller.Three-year-old Coco goes missing on a weekend of family celebrations. The story flits between that weekend and the weekend of her father's funeral 12 years later.There are some intentionally awful characters, perfectly developed so it's easy to dislike them immensely, and most of them are present throughout both weekends. The past is told in the third person, while Coco's older half-sister Camilla, from their father's previous marriage, narrates the present day.The suspense builds up gradually as the plot develops, and I was desperate to find out what happened to that little innocent girl. I went through a roller coaster of emotions, ranging from sadness and fear to disgust and disbelief. And when I finally waded through the lies and deception and discovered the truth, I was even more horrified.This is a stunningly-plotted book that looks at the cruel, dark and devious side of human nature, in people in a position of trust, and reveals some disturbing family secrets.Don't miss it!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley."},

With akiller on the loose and the dark Arctic waters closing in, it falls to Ari Thórto piece together a puzzle that involves tangled local politics, a compromisednew mayor and a psychiatric ward in Reykjavik where someone is being heldagainst their will...My verdictNightblind is an amazing Icelandic Noir novel, even better than Snowblind, the first in the series (even though I never thought that possible).The story begins around five years after Snowblind. Ari Thór is still in Siglufjördur and is seemingly settled in a relationship with his girlfriend Kristín and their 10-month-old son Stefnir. His work colleague Tomás has moved to Reykjavík, and Ari Thór has been passed over for promotion in favour of another policeman, Herjólfur. When Herjólfur is murdered in a desolate house on the outskirts of town, the usually quiet Siglufjördur is thrown into a state of turmoil. Ari Thór is tasked with finding the killer among its shell-shocked inhabitants, while also dealing with trouble on the home front.Yet again, Ragnar Jónasson has created a beautifully-written Agatha Christie-style murder mystery and Quentin Bates has translated it into English with perfection. Iceland is an ideal place to set a crime series - the vivid descriptions of the stark bitterly cold environment and desolate surroundings are truly fascinating and add depth to the atmospheric, dark plot.As with Snowblind, this novel grabbed my attention straight away. It switches seamlessly between the descriptive passages and its many twists and turns, and kept me intrigued right until the end. The author's use of language is stunning and transports you into the heart of Iceland.This is a fantastic book, and Ari Thór is a well-developed extremely likeable protagonist. I look forward to seeing how this series - and its characters - continues to grow and develop over time.I received an Advance Reader Copy in return for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},
{"title": "My Writing Process by Claire Fuller", "date": "Wednesday 6 January 2016", "text": "I would like to welcome Claire Fuller to my blog today, to talk about her writing process. Claire's book Our Endless Numbered Days was published in paperback by Penguin on 31 December 2015. My Writing ProcessBy Claire FullerI’m just beginning to write my thirdnovel, and it’s taken until now to work out if my writing process is differentfor each book, or what similarities there are. What I’m only just realising is howimportant it is for me to have an idea of place before I start. Where do mycharacters live – country, area, type of house, room – I need to be able to seethe space they inhabit before I can really get to grips with the story. And it seems after two and a bitnovels, I’m a big follower of the process that E.L. Doctorow talked about inhis famous quote: “Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can onlysee as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” I’m not a planner. I have a vagueshifting idea of an end point; perhaps who will live and who will die, but noidea how that life or death will happen. I start with one or two characters, dropthem into a location, and see what they do. If it’s going well, by about aquarter or a third of the way through the characters take over and willsometimes refuse to do things. This isn’t anything spooky, it’s just that Iknow in detail the type of people they are, their habits, their likes anddislikes, and this in depth knowledge begins to help the story along. In mysecond novel, Swimming Lessons, I had two characters who I wanted to gettogether quickly, but they took chapters and chapters to do it. I’d put them ina room together and they would barely look each other in the eye. In the end Ihad to let them do it in their own time. I don’t like writing. Perhaps itwould be easier if I were a planner, but because sometimes I really don’t knowwhat is going to happen next, it can be difficult. I treat it like a job; it ishow I make my living, so I sit down at my desk at 9am and stop at 6pm. I dolots of other things during those hours, of course – I’m easily distracted –but that is my working day. What I do like however, is editing. Oh, to write The End on a first draft! Once I have70,000 words or whatever, then I can have fun – cutting, moving sections,working on the structure – and then playing with the words, making sure eachone is right, that sentences flow, that it all has a rhythm when I read italoud. However, I do edit a bit as I goalong. It’s impossible for me to write without going back a short way each dayand reworking. My new words are so abysmal that if I didn’t go back and edit alittle bit then the writer’s doubt that we all suffer from would be tooinhibiting. But I set myself some rules: Whenever I sit down to write I mustalso add new words to my manuscript. I’m never allowed to just edit until I’vefinished. Even if I only have ten minutes writing time, just three or so of thosecan be spent editing. If I have a full day available then I aim for 1,000 words(but I’m secretly happy if I get 800 down). At the end of each day I keep atally of what my new word count is and a line of two of what I did and how itwent. Very often I write something like, ‘I can’t do this, why am I doingthis?’. And to keep the internal critic at bay while I’m writing I allow it afew words of its own now and again. So, in the middle of a paragraph I mightwrite in square brackets [this is rubbish], and then carry on writing. It’salso reassuring to know that if I’m run over by a bus before the manuscript isfinished no one will think that I believed it was any good.

Stella's baby has disappeared from the family home, with all of the baby paraphernalia, and Stella is found several miles away in a serious car accident. But Stella has lost her memory and can't remember that day or the events leading up to it. She doesn't know what's happened to her baby girl and whether or not she killed her daughter. At one point, she starts doubting whether she had a baby at all.Stella is suffering from post partum psychosis. She has jumbled thoughts and gaps in her memory, alongside an unsupportive husband who's away a lot for work. Struggling with motherhood, she has received no help or support. It's only after baby Mia goes missing, and she's suspected of murder, that she's given the treatment she needs.I found Little Girl Gone to be a roller coaster paced read. I struggled with the first third of the book, as Stella's character annoyed me, and admit that I wondered whether to put it to one side. But gradually the layers built up. By around halfway through, certain events came to light and new characters appeared. From then on, I was intrigued to see which way the plot was going. The rest of the book moved at a much faster pace, as Stella's memory started coming back and she went in search of the truth.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

The friendship that grows between Welty and him is fascinating, heartbreaking, and a must for fans of either author looking for greater insight into what made each of them tick.”Book blurbIn 1970,Ross Macdonald wrote a letter to Eudora Welty, beginning a thirteen-yearcorrespondence between fellow writers and kindred spirits. Though separated bybackground, geography, genre, and his marriage, the two authors shared theirlives in witty, wry, tender, and at times profoundly romantic letters, eachdrawing on the other for inspiration, comfort, and strength. They brought theirliterary talents to bear on a wide range of topics, discussing each others'publications, the process of translating life into fiction, the nature of thewriter's block each encountered, books they were reading, and friends andcolleagues they cherished. They also discussed the world around them, theVietnam War, the Nixon, Carter, and Reagan presidencies, and the environmentalthreats facing the nation. The letters reveal the impact each had on theother's work, and they show the personal support Welty provided whenAlzheimer's destroyed Macdonald's ability to communicate and write. The editorsof this collection, who are the definitive biographers of these two literaryfigures, have provided extensive commentary and an introduction.

Not being able to find Scarlett was one of thebiggest regrets of DCI Louisa Smith's career and when Scarlett is discoveredback in her home town after all this time, Lou is determined to find out whathappened to her and why she remained hidden for so long. Was she abducted ordid she run away?As Lou andher team delve deeper into Scarlett's past, their investigation throws up more questionsthan it answers. But as they edge closer to the truth about what really went onbehind closed doors, it is more sinister and disturbing than they had everimagined.My verdictWow, I couldn't put this down. Elizabeth Haynes is a brilliant writer and Behind Closed Doors is certainly up to her usual high standards.Behind Closed Doors is the second book in the Detective Inspector Louisa Smith series. I have read the first book, but this was a long time ago, so I'm sure you could easily read this as a standalone.The book follows the story of 14-year-old Scarlett, who disappeared during a family holiday to Greece. Ten years later, Scarlett has now been found. The chapters switch between the present day police investigation and Scarlett's story.Elizabeth Haynes has a wonderful way of writing emotion that pours off the page. This book moves at a fast pace and the story keeps flowing. It certainly kept me intrigued all the way through.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

But behind her sharp edges and meticulously craftedfacade lies the darkest of pasts . . .When adocumentary producer invites Ani to tell her side of the chilling and violentincident that took place when she was a teenager at the prestigious Bradleyschool, she hopes it will be an opportunity to prove how far she's turned herlife around since then. She'll even let the production company film her lavishwedding, the final step in her transformation.But as thewedding and filming converge, Ani's past threatens to come back and haunt her.And as her immaculate veneer starts to crack, she is forced to question: willbreaking her silence destroy all that she has worked for - or, will it at longlast, set Ani free?My verdictLuckiest Girl Alive is an intriguing and compelling book. It initially reads as a 'chick lit' novel. But as you turn the pages, you realise that the story goes far deeper.On the surface, Ani seems to be living the dream - she's highly successful and about to marry well. But you soon discover that underneath that bitchy exterior she's not really the woman she appears to be. She's reinvented herself over the years, running away from her past and a shocking incident that happened to her as a teenager.By switching between the backstory and the present day, the tension builds up, layer by layer. Until you worry about how the story is going to end. Ani isn't a particularly likeable character, even once you know what drives her. But the question is whether she's the 'luckiest girl alive'?Luckiest Girl Alive covers a highly topical issue. It's vivid, highly emotional, thought-provoking and very frightening in how real it actually is. It's written with dark and twisted humour. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did, and by the end I couldn't put it down.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Five amazing crime series I've discovered in 2015", "date": "Sunday 20 December 2015", "text": "I love crime novels and six series have really stood out for me this year. The books in the first series on my list weren't all published in 2015, but I discovered this forensic crime series this year and read them in order. I look forward to seeing how all these series continue to grow in 2016.Jen J Danna with Ann Vanderlaan - Abbott & Lowell series (Published by Five Star Publishing)Dead, Without a Stone to Tell it (28 August 2013)A taster of my review: It took me just one day to read this book. I loved it. It is an amazing debut. I enjoyed the descriptions and background of the forensic science, as well as the well-rounded characters and fascinating storyline. It makes me realise how some other best-selling series in a similar vein have become tired over time, with complicated stories and not much else. These books are perfect for fans of Kathy Reich and Patricia Cornwell.Click here to read my full review.No One Sees Me 'Til I Fall (24 November 2013)A taster of my review: I read this in one sitting - taking me only around an hour - as I couldn't actually put it down. It was just as good as Jen J Danna's first book, although a mini version as it's a novella rather than a novel. Still, it had all the same components - enjoyable storyline, forensic explanations and good characters.Click here to read my full review.A Flame in the Wind of Death (18 April 2014)A taster of my review: The prologue sucked me into the story straight away with its vivid description of a fire set by an arsonist... This has become a new series for me to follow, and I look forward to the fourth book, which is being published next month (18 February 2015).Click here for my full reviewTwo Parts Bloody Murder (18 February 2015)A taster of my review: A wonderful mixture of historical information, a well-written plotline, forensics and romance. I like the way each chapter starts with a historical fact and how the authors describe the forensics in layperson's terms.Click here for my full review.CLICK HERE TO READ MY INTERVIEW WITH JEN J DANNA.Caroline Mitchell's Jennifer Knight series(published by Bookouture) Don't Turn Around (24 April 2015 )A taster of my review: Don't Turn Around is exactly as it describes itself - a supernatural thriller. It's certainly not run-of-the mill. The book is creepy, intriguing and an enjoyable read.Click here for my full reviewTime to Die (24 September 2015)A taster of my review: Time to Die is even better than Caroline Mitchell's first novel. You could read it as a standalone, but you will probably enjoy it more if you read Don't Turn Around first... The descriptions tackle all of your senses. It's just as well I don't get nightmares as this certainly keeps your heart racing. I would say it's perfect bedtime reading, but maybe not for the faint-hearted (read it with the lights on)!Click here to read my full review.Angela Marsons' Kim Stone series (published by Bookouture)Silent Scream  (20th February 2015)Snippet of my review: It's highly unusual for me to find a book that leads me to put my life on hold. But Angela Marson's Silent Scream has led me to virtually abandon work for the last day, even with deadlines looming, leaving my house a mess and the ironing pile untouched.Click here to read my whole review.Evil Games (29 May 2015)Snippet from my review: Yet again Angela Marsons has written a 5* crime novel. I loved Silent Scream and was so excited to be given the opportunity to read the next one before publication. Evil Games is certainly as good as the first, if not better, and I wish I could give it a higher rating than 5/5.Click here to read my whole review.Lost Girls (6 November 2015)Snippet from my review: Angela Marsons' books get better and better.

You can tell that the author has had direct experience of the two main locations, with lovely descriptions and insights into both Cambridge and Amsterdam. George is a great character - she's feisty, intelligent and curious, but also has a vulnerable side. And she seems to have a habit of getting heavily involved in difficult situations.Click here for my full review.The Girl Who Broke The Rules (20 August 2015)A taster of my review: I think this book is even better than the first in the series. The writing is fast-paced and highly readable with some graphic and gory descriptions. As the story progresses, the tension builds up and the body count rises. I had no idea about the identity of the murderer, and the culprit was a complete surprise.Click here for my full review.CLICK HERE TO READ ABOUT MARNIE RICHES' PATHWAY TO PUBLICATION.Alexandra Sokoloff's Huntress Moon series(published by Thomas & Mercer)Huntress Moon  (27 January 2015)A taster of my review: The book dives straight into the action and doesn't stop, with its fast-paced descriptions and snappy dialogue.  For me, the characters really came alive as the Huntress and Roarke pit their wits against each other.

{"title": "The Menagerie adult colouring book", "date": "Wednesday 16 December 2015", "text": "The Menagerie: Animal Portraits to ColourPublished by Michael O'Mara Books (12 November 2015)ISBN: 978-1910552155My verdictThe Menagerie is an amazing colouring book. The pages are slightly larger and thicker than other books I have reviewed so far. Each page is single sided, which is brilliant as you don't need to worry about any bleed through. And every page is perforated near the book spine, so you can easily tear them out and display them without ruining the book.As expected, the pictures are all of animals, from a stag and a giraffe to a red panda and a zebra. They are in gorgeous detail, but you can choose whether to colour in every little space or just colour in larger areas.Most have backgrounds already printed on them but you can always add your own or colour these in yourself.This work in progress (Bengal tiger) is coloured with Faber-Castell Polycromos pencils (a range of just 24 goes a long way!). Here, I've coloured in some larger areas to create more impact.This Work in Progress (hippopotamus) is being coloured with a mixture of Staedtler triplus colour pens, Staedtler Fineliners and Stabilo point88 pen - none of which bled through. I am colouring in every little area to show the detail.The Menagerie will delight people of all ages. My youngest son (age 12) 'stole' one of my pages (the llama) to colour - although I have now bought him his own copy of the book.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

Taunting the police. Enthralling the press. Capturing the public’simagination.But this isno virtual threat.As thenumber of his followers rises, so does the body count.Eight yearsago two young girls did something unforgivable. Now ambitious police officerNasreen and investigative journalist Freddie are thrown together again in adesperate struggle to catch this cunning, fame-crazed killer. But can they stayone step ahead of him? And can they escape their own past?Time'srunning out. Everyone is following the #Murderer. But what if he is followingyou?ONLINE, NOONE CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM …My verdictFollow Me is a crime novel in keeping with modern times - a serial killer is using Twitter to communicate their horrific murders to the wider world. With its up-to-date plot, this book is quite different from other crime novels I have read recently.Freddie dreams of being an investigative journalist. But she's currently 'making do' by writing for free and working in a coffee bar and she's obsessed with social media. She really isn't happy with any aspect of her current life. When she bumps into her childhood friend Nasreen, who's now a police officer, Freddie realises this could be her chance to have her big break and better herself. But she has no idea that she's about to discover how social media can be used for some very dark practices.Follow Me is intriguing (and even amusing at times), following the 'Hashtag Murderer' as he builds up Twitter followers. The writing is fast paced - so fast that it made my head 'spin' from time to time. The short chapters and snappy dialogue keep the story going. I did have a few reservations about the plausibility of some aspects of the plot, particularly whether the police would have given a complete stranger (and no-hoper) such a prominent role in an investigation, taking her to crime scenes and raiding potential suspects' properties. But I guess this is a book where you just have to go with the flow and take the story as it is.Freddie and Nasreen struggle to work together. The two women did something at school that neither can forget, and their story is gradually revealed as the book progresses.When it comes to the main plot, the author certainly keeps you guessing right until the end - when the identity of the murderer is finally revealed. And the culprit was certainly not who I expected.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},

I hope you get this. Email back ifyou do, please. I hear you’ve got a book coming out in February from OrendaBooks in London. Is it the same one you emailed me a while back?

Didn’tthat seem just a little condescending?CAT: Are you still there?YUSUF: You know, I really thoughtyou were going to ask me questions about the book. It’s about a US intelligenceagent, Thelonius Liddell, who’s accused of terrorism and dies under mysteriouscircumstances in a secret overseas prison. I’ve been working on it for a longtime.

Now, suppose you were to ask me how Icame to write Jihadi: A Love Story, which Publishers Weekly called “smart andsearing”?YUSUF: Are you still there?YUSUF: Hello?CAT: Yes. I’m here. Suppose I make a habitof calling you “Human Being” in this article. Instead of giving you a name. Wouldn’t that signal a certain failure ofimagination?CAT: Are you still there?CAT: Hello?CAT: Are there any other cats in Jihadi: A Love Story?CAT: Fine. How did you come to write thebook?YUSUF: One of the inspirations wasthe Raymond Davis affair in Pakistan. You can Google that, okay?

{"title": "Drive, Imagine, Write - a guest post by Laura Treacy Bentley", "date": "Wednesday 9 December 2015", "text": "I would like to welcome Laura Treacy Bentley to my blog today. Laura's short story Night Terrors was published on 16 April 2015. Night Terrors is a prequel to her novel The Silver Tattoo, which was published on 2 April 2013.Drive, imagine, writeBy Laura Treacy Bentley                                                                         No moon or stars out tonight, and I’mdriving alone down that dark country road again. No GPS or radio switched onbecause I need to make my own music, and that music is fiction. So, it’s justme and my imagination waiting to witness what lies ahead, and the headlightslead the way and seek out the next bend in the road. I identify with E.L.Doctorow when he said “Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only seeas far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.”  That’s how I feel every time I sit down to writea novel. It’s a lonely but exciting journey. I want to be just as surprised asthe reader when they round the next curve with me. Do I have an outline, aplan, or a road map?  No, usually not,but I may have a mile marker or two in mind like the setting, what myprotagonist needs/wants, the opening line, the climax, or possibly the end ofthe novel, but it’s different each time I travel that midnight road. My first novel was historical fiction basedon family history and a dramatic event in the life of my great grandfather wholived in western Maryland. I researched like crazy, studied genealogy,collected old letters, interviewed a relative, and talked to everyone I couldat the time. I learned the town history, read related books, compiled ascrapbook of photos and research, visited the historical society and theancestral home, talked with a local priest, toured a grist mill, and finallybegan a first draft. I used the real names of my ancestors and had fun makingup dialogue and imagining and fictionalizing the story.It’s been so long agonow, but I do remember that I wrote it slowly, chapter by chapter, and then I’dpour over my research notes. When it was in decent shape, I asked a couple ofpeople to read it. They were very kind and honest, but it was my first novel,and, to be truthful, it wasn’t very good. I was a novice and didn’t realisethat my poetic license might not sit well with the sacred memories of others. Iknew that my imaginings were not always historically accurate, that it was an incompleteand imperfect draft with many errors, but it was a fascinating story thatwanted to be told. Perhaps with heavy editing, I could have made it work,breathed new life into it, but I was an amateur and had a reached a dead endroad, so I put it in a drawer. Chalk up one important trip down that lonelydark road to simply get my feet wet and learn how to write a novel. My second novel is a psychological thrillerset primarily in Ireland, and its genesis was a photo that I had taken of abusker in Dublin, Ireland. Later it became my inspiration for a short story.I’m also a poet, so I’m often driven by image, and the photograph was full ofmystery and intrigue. I had the great luck of belonging to a writers’ groupcalled The Rogues, and everyone was serious about finishing a novel, so the barwas high. I wrote new chapters every two weeks or so, and we met and critiquedeach others’ work over food, wine, and laughter. It was an exciting and immenselyrewarding time, and I couldn’t seem to type fast enough. Often after ourmeeting, I would go home and immediately revise based on their suggestions andwrite a new chapter that very night. I still had maps and photos and journalsand research scattered all over my office, but I kept my eyes on the road thistime and finished it in about a year before I began my deep revisions. Thegreat news was that eventually I acquired an agent and after major ups anddowns my novel was finally published. This second road trip was more fun butstill intense and thrilling. A mystery is my current work-in-progress,and it also began as a short story that I drew from and expanded upon duringNaNoWriMo a couple of years ago. The wild pace of trying to write an entirenovel in one month was exhilarating and simply crazy. It required a strictcommitment from me to write like mad every day to complete the 50,000 word goal,and I did! I set the kitchen timer for one hour or more each day and typedwithout stopping. Some of it was gibberish, some inspired, but that’s thebeauty of NaNo. What matters is that the fear of writing, the terror of sittingdown at the computer and opening up the document each day is gone. The freedom ofcomposing and imagining with no censorship is very freeing. It also gave me adeadline which I needed, and it made me accountable as I recorded my progressonline each day. Now I’m intensely editing this November and am checking inwith a friend who is writing her first novel during NaNoWriMo.  As her word count goes up, mine goes down asI revise. It’s so great to have a friend to report my daily mileage to and keepme honest. Although editing is very different, it keeps me on the road torediscovering and reinventing my novel and, hopefully, makes it more powerful.So, what did I learn?Just tell the story first. Don’t lethistorical accuracy and intensive research create numerous speedbumps along theway. The detailed research can be added in later during the revision process,but in the beginning you just need to write the story. Don’t Google everythingand get totally lost on a side road, and don’t share your work before it’sfinished.A small writing group of hand-pickedmembers who are highly motivated is a compelling force. Friends, food, andlaughter keep your spirits up. If you write just one page a day, you’ll end upwith a 365 page novel in one year. If you write two pages a day, you’ll have adraft in six months, etc.NaNoWriMocan help you write a novel very fast! It keeps your fingers typing, and you canlock your evil critic in the closet. Be prepared to edit heavily in the weeksand months ahead in order to shape and cut and pace and polish. You’ll acquirea new set of eyes and a fresh perspective when you reread it.Now, relax, have fun, put yourself first, make a commitment to someone andreport in each day or every week, create a deadline, tell everyone on Facebook/Twitterthat you are writing a draft/editing, try to write the same time every dayuntil it becomes habit, set the alarm on your cell phone or kitchen timer,close your office/bedroom door, and open the document. For me that’s half thebattle! Once it’s open, you have to look at it and read the last thing youwrote.  Then you will be tempted to fix justone comma or one misspelling or add/delete one word, and before you know it,you’re cruising down that dark road again looking for adventure and the hours willdisappear. It’s important to go outside every day andwalk or run or swim or bike or exercise. Sitting in a room for hours takes itstoll. I carry my camera with me all the time now when I take walks, and it’svery calming to save a moment in a photograph. It feels like a poem sometimes,a small meditation, and I even created a Facebook page a year ago called Poetographyto store those moments in. Looking for beauty or unique photos to take, keepsme framing scenes in my mind very much like writing. I’ve become more sensitiveand aware of my surroundings and notice the smallest things. I’ve gone fromlooking to really seeing life around me, and I use this time to refuel and imagineand problem solve plot points in my novel on a subconscious level. Like Doctorow,I believe that if you keep your eyes on the road ahead, your imagination will leadyou to your final destination. Keep driving, keep imagining, and, above all,keep writing!

Through a series of flashbacks, the reader learns more about Leah and Conor’s story, their close relationship with Conor’s best friend Ferdie and what has led Leah to her current path.Several chilling events suggest that a stalker is following Leah’s every move, prompting her to flee to Ireland’s dangerous Cliffs of Moher, seeking refuge among the local myths and folklore. There she becomes intrigued with the story about an old Irish warrior. When a mysterious woman, who calls herself Rowan, tries to push Leah off the cliffs, Leah realises her life is in danger.Laura Treacy Bentley writes beautiful prose, with amazing descriptions of the Irish countryside. The Silver Tattoo is a chilling, haunting and dark tale, ideal for anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers and Irish legends."},
{"title": "For Reasons Unknown - Writing/Editing: a guest post by Michael Wood - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Monday 7 December 2015", "text": "I am delighted that MICHAEL WOOD is joining me on my blog today, as part of his Blog Tour. Michael's book - For Reasons Unknown - was published by Killer Reads on 5 November 2015. For Reasons Unknown - Writing/EditingBy Michael WoodFor Reasons Unknown is not the first novel I have written.However, it is the first novel I have had published. The reason for this isbecause the others were obviously not very good. My approach to this novel wasdifferent too. I decided I wanted to write a series rather than a standalone sobefore I began with the story and plot I concentrated on my main character. I wanted my protagonist to be a strong independent womanwith a mass of vulnerabilities and lacking in self-confidence. DCI MatildaDarke is at the top of her career, and, on paper, seems to have everythingshe’s always wanted. In her personal life she is a complete mess. She hasrecently lost her husband, and her career is on a downward spiral as she made amassive error in a highly publicised case she was working on while her husbandwas dying. Now, she is a shadow of her former self. I needed a sounding boardfor Matilda, someone she can turn to when she is feeling low and who willlisten to her. This task befalls to her best friend Adele Kean. Adele has alsobeen through a tough point on her life, however, she has come through it and isstronger than ever. Adele represents everything Matilda wants to be. She willget there – eventually. How? That’s a question even I don’t know the answer to.Creating Matilda’s team was interesting and a fun exercise.I wanted a range of characters, all with their own private lives which theywere dealing with silently, whereas Matilda’s private life had been brought outinto the public domain. They all look up to Matilda and admire her. However,she needs them more than they need her. She just doesn’t realise it yet.Once the characters were in place the story came next. Asthe title suggests, I am more interested in the psychology of a crime – thewhydunit rather than the whodunit. I didn’t want to create the story in detailbefore I sat down to write it as I’m a very fluid writer; I like conversationsto be natural and if I don’t know what the characters are going to say untilI’m writing them, then the plot can go off in any direction. That is theexcitement of writing. I was more than three-quarters of the way throughwriting For Reasons Unknown before I decided who the killer was going to be.Once I had written the first draft and chosen my killer I then went backthrough it all dropping red herrings along the way.The editing process is a difficult, but important one. Thewriting needs to be tightened up depending on the pace of the novel andsentence structure and words chosen are looking at carefully. Researching isimportant too. I had to rewrite a whole chapter once I had found out whathappens when someone is stabbed in the stomach, which was a shame as I enjoyedthe original chapter. I am at my happiest when I’m writing, but I also enjoyediting too, especially after the first draft is written. When the story iscomplete it is interesting to go back over the story and see who says what andwhy. Editing it just as important as writing.I am approaching the end of the first draft of book two. Itis at this point that the hard work begins. Strangely, I’m looking forward toit.About Michael WoodMichaelWood is Sheffield born and bred and has chosen the steel city to set his crimefiction novels in.

For the first time since she had beenrescued from the storm, she had a whole day to herself and no one expectedanything of her. She could do exactly as she pleased.The sunrose in the east and she turned away from the glare, into the west. The smellof the wet pungent earth stung the inside of her nostrils, and she could hearevery noise as though it were ten times louder than it actually was. The soundof the squeak on the front wheel as it went round and round, the crunch of thewheels as they met and churned the gravel in the rough road. The birdstwittering, the river roaring and even the silence of the bog.She shoutedhello to every man and woman she passed on the roads and stopped whenever shewas waved down to be handed a drink by women standing in front of theircottages who saw her ride by. Ruby knew it was the custom to make this gestureto all travellers on the road.This wasnot Ruby’s usual life. Today she was someone else. She was simply a girl on abike out for the day, visiting the place she thought of as home.The firsthour flew by in a haze of joy. There were many conversations with strangers atgates, as they dipped metal cups into a rain barrel and handed her an oatbiscuit, each wanting her to stop and give them news of wherever she had comefrom. They were all desperate for gossip. But Ruby had no time to chat, forlong.She calledinto the store at Bangor Erris and was directed on her way by the shopkeeper.‘Mysister’s boy works at the inn at Doohoma,’ she shouted after Ruby, puzzled byher urgency. No one rushed anywhere in Mayo.As she leftBangor Erris, her mood altered. Her feet pushed slower and her heart beatfaster. Eventually, she drew up in front of a signpost which told her that shewas entering Doohoma. She stared down the single-track road towards the placewhere she had lived and her family had died. The place she knew would call herback, forever.Atravellers’ wagon, pulled by two piebalds, startled her as they cantered past.Sitting up on the front board was a woman with long grey hair and black teeth.As she passed Ruby, she spat out a plug of chewed tobacco that landed on thefloor at Ruby’s feet. Laughing as she cracked the reins and sped by. On theback board sat two boys. One of them threw something at Ruby. It was a stone.‘Oi, youeejits,’ she shouted, as she felt a sharp pain and then saw the blood dribblingdown her leg. She felt tears prickling at the back of her eyes. This was nothow she had imagined returning to Doohoma to be.Taking herhandkerchief from her pocket, she spat on it and began dabbing to stem the flowfrom her shin. This gave her a chance to pull her thoughts together. She knewwhere the house was and how to get there.This isit Ruby, she saidto herself, you are back home girl.Ruby FlynnBy Nadine DorriesPublished by Head of Zeus (3 December 2015)ISBN: 978-1784082185SynopsisTheFitzDeanes are wealthy.

{"title": "Lost Ocean Colouring Book by Johanna Basford", "date": "Friday 4 December 2015", "text": "Lost Ocean: An Inky Adventure and Colouring bookBy Johanna BasfordPublished by Virgin Books/Ebury Publishing (22 October 2015)ISBN: 978-0753557150My verdictLost Ocean is a beautiful colouring book with stunning pictures on an ocean theme (as expected). This is my first Johanna Basford book so I can't compare it to her previous books, but I will certainly be looking out for more of her work.The pages are double sided, so my suggestion is that you don't use any pens that may bleed through (e.g. Sharpies). There is a double-sided four-page spread at the end of the book to pull out. There's an adventure theme all the way through, with pictures to find as you colour in the pages.The pictures are exquisitely drawn, with minute detail in places. You need very fine pens and well-sharpened pencils. Each page certainly kept me amused for hours.Work in progress 1I'm colouring this with a mixture of Staedtler triplus colour pens, Staedtler Fineliners, Stabilo point88 pens and Uni-ball Signo Sparkling Gel Ink Rollerball pens. None of the pens can be seen through the page.Work in progress 2This is the last colouring page of the book, other than the pull out spread. I'm using WHSmith colour pencils and also Faber Castell Polycromos pencils. Not that many of the pages include mermaids, shipwrecks or treasure - most of them focus on fish, shells and other forms of sea life - which is why I chose this.I do feel that some of the pictures could have taken up more space on the page, as there's quite a bit of white space. A couple of mandalas had large gaps in the middle, making them look a bit empty. I'm sure that someone with artistic talent could fill them in their their own drawings and pictures. I may even have a go myself.Examples of more pages to colour, to give you an idea of the variety and detail:I was very excited to receive an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

I've met so many amazing people - bloggers, authors, publicists, publishers (many of whom have become 'real' friends, not just 'virtual' ones) - all with a love of reading. I have a huge 'To Be Read' pile that never seems to go down, as more and more brilliant books come on the scene.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Theresa Talbot", "date": "Tuesday 1 December 2015", "text": "I am delighted that THERESA TALBOT is joining me on my blog today. Her crime novel - Penance - was published by Strident Publishing on 2 October 2015. What inspired you to write your novel Penance?I’m a freelance radio presenter with BBC Radio Scotland. Several years ago, I was researching The Magdalene Institution in Glasgow for apossible radio feature. The Magdalenes are synonymous with Ireland but theywere actually widespread throughout the mainland. The Glasgow Magdalene closed its doors in1958 after the girls staged a 3 day ‘riot’ amid claims of abuse. No one wasever brought to trial. I found some old newspaper articles in the archives andone had a photograph of the girls. I was just haunted by it and it raised somany questions in my mind. What caused them to stage such a protest? After all, the asylum had existed in Glasgow inone form or another for over 100 years. What happened on that particular day tospark such a reaction? I also wanted to know what happened to the inmates oncethey left the Magdalene. Did they end up on the streets? Were they sucked intoa world of prostitution? That was my initial inspiration and it grew into acrime novel!Your first book, This is What I Look Like, features humoroustales from your career at Radio Scotland. Did your writing process change whenyou switched to writing fiction?I LOVED writing ThisIs What I Look Like. A friend described it as ‘an easy read’ but it was avery ‘easy write’ too! It’s very much in a conversational style and because I’mused to writing scripts for radio – albeit news scripts – I found I got into myflow very easily. Writing Penance was a whole different ball game…BUT Penance actuallycame first. I wrote it several years ago and tucked it away terrified to letanyone read it. When I wrote that I ate, breathed and slept the characters. Ilaboured over the plot – tied myself in knots sometimes. It took me a long timeto learn that the narrative and the dialogue really had to drive the storyforward or it quickly became stagnant. Penance is about social injustice,wasted lives and pain, but above all it is a crime novel so it had to flow at acertain pace. I would spend a day writing a chapter – go to bed satisfied thatI’d worked hard, then wake up the next morning and think ‘Oh Gawd I need to dothat all again…’ The final edits for Penance were done after T.I.W.I.L.L waspublished and that was actually harder than writing it!Are you a plotter or a pantser? Do you plot out a wholenovel before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?A bit of both actually. With Penance, I had this ‘fabulous’plot in my head…but quickly realised that plots were only as strong as thecharacters within the story. As I gave the characters flesh and blood, that‘brilliant plot’ I was convinced was so good began to be a weight around myneck. I had to let it go and let the story unfold naturally – and therelationships between the characters often dictated to me what happened next.My main protagonist is Oonagh O’Neil and initially (during my brilliant plotera) I killed her off in the third chapter. I thought I was beingterribly clever and brave in a sort of Hitchcock-ian way. Then I realised I wasjust being an eejit and once I re-established Oonagh as the main characterPenance really took shape and it unfolded in a way that I wasn’t alwaysprepared for. I’m glad I didn’t kill her off now as I really like her. I wishshe was my pal!Do you have any strange writing habits?Not strange as such – but I do find the words flow betteronce they’re lubricated by a glass of wine. And I often go for a long walk tosort out a plot problem in my head so I sort of ‘talk’ to the characters andspeak their dialogue as I’m walking. Actually reading that back it sounds asthough I just get drunk then wander off into the distance talking to myself!But it’s not like that…I’m working. Oh and I never write on a Saturday. I don’tknow why…I just don’t.Can you describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Oh no..this is hard. I’m sure I’ll either sound dead pompousor a total lightweight! Ok here we go…  (Ineed to change my writing style between radio bulletins, non-fiction humour anddark crime) humorous, dark, heartbreaking, tense and  straight to the point. How do you juggle writing with your day job at RadioScotland?I’m lucky that I’m freelance, so can work three days a week atthe BBC and the other three days writing (remember I don’t write on Saturdays!)That’s the theory anyway..in reality what happens is I wait until I have adeadline then stay up until silly o’clock finishing an edit, or tweaking thatfinal chapter. I just sort of squeeze it in somehow – and I often write duringmy lunch breaks.Which authors do you admire most?Oh crikey, almost too many to mention…the Bronte Sisters andJane Austen to start with. I can read Jane Eyre over and over again – butreader I won’t! I love John Fowles – the Magus holds a special place in myheart - I think The Collector is terrifying…yet oddly benign at the same time.Crime authors - Denise Mina is wonderful (I have a soft spot for Glasgow basedcrime) – Val McDermid too. Anne Tyler has to get a mention for the way sheportrays such mundane ordinary situations and pulls the reader in. Ask me thesame question tomorrow and I’ll give you another 10 names.I often ask authors – 'If you were writing a book about yourlife, what would the title be' – but you’ve already written one! So my questionis: Why did you choose This is What I Look Like as the title?Ha ha ha! My publisher chose the name as working in radio,people often recognise my voice but they have no idea what I look like. Ipresented a gardening programme for BBC Radio Scotland and we did a lot ofoutside broadcasts and regular listeners would come along and many wouldsay…’Oh..you sound blonder /darker /taller /shorter /thinner /fatter/older/younger on-air. Radio is such an intimate medium – yet anonymous at thesame time.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Just write! I spent years saying ‘Oh I’d love to be awriter..’ then my partner said..’well you actually need to write somethingfirst!’ I was always a bit scared that it would never be good enough. Soembrace your mistakes – love your errors – be proud of your achievements. Thinkof it like cooking – or driving – or any skill. It’s a learning curve – aprocess. And find your own voice. Also don’t try to exist in a vacuum – by thatI mean mix with other writers. Attend writing classes – readers groups – go alongto readers events in pubs/libraries etc…and be generous. Be generous of spirit.If you can help another writer give your time your advice your help freely. Itcomes back tenfold. The world needs more writers – the world needs more books.  And lastly, why should people read Penance? Penance is a crime novel which tells the story of thousandsof women who lived and died in shame because there was no-one to speak up forthem. Set in the year 2000 to flash backs to the past. The characters are realflesh and blood people, it’s evocative, fast moving, tense and heartbreaking atthe same time. And you’ll love Oonagh O’Neill.About Theresa TalbotTheresa is a freelance writer, journalist and radio presenter.

But when she arrivesshe realises this is a death like no other. It seems the girl was trying toescape - but from the West.Müller is amember of the People's Police, but in East Germany her power only stretches sofar. The Stasi want her to discover the identity of the girl, but assure herthe case is otherwise closed - and strongly discourage her from askingquestions.Theevidence doesn't add up, and it soon becomes clear the crime scene has beenstaged. But this is not a regime that tolerates a curious mind, and Müllerdoesn't realise that the trail she's following will lead her dangerously closeto home . . .My verdictStasi Child is an excellent thriller set in 1970s Berlin before the Wall came down.The story focuses on the discovery of a teenage girl's body at the foot of the Wall. What's unusual is that the girl appears to have been escaping from the West to the East. Oberleutnant Karen Muller and her team are tasked with trying to find out the girl's identity. But not everyone wants them asking questions.Stasi Child has a complex plot with twists and turns that build up the tension. It's filled with corruption, control and violence. The author has captured the atmosphere well, with vivid descriptions of the Berlin setting and the contrast between East and West. This was a time of secrets, lies and paranoia. Anyone could be under Stasi control. People were wary about what they said and did, even when they were considered to be an authority figure themselves. Karen Muller is an interesting protagonist, not as cold and detached as some of her colleagues, and actually cares about what happened to the victim. She's also curious about what's on the other side of the Wall, which keeps the Stasi on their toes.Stasi Child is a well-written debut and I look forward to seeing what the author has in store for Karen next.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},

Marnie's latest book The Girl Who Broke The Rules was published by Avon (Harper Collins) in August 2015. It's the second in the George McKenzie trilogy. The third book - The Girl Who Walked In The Shadows - will be published in March 2016.My path to publicationBy Marnie Riches                                                                         It’s NaNoWriMo! Many of you have been spending November toilingaway to get those all-important 50,000 words of a first draft down. Brilliant!The overwhelming majority of you, however, will find that you’ve produced onlythe beginnings of something that may, one day, be developed, polished andcommercially viable enough to be published.The fact is, that writing a debut novel and getting it publishedtakes time. It certainly took me not months, but years. During my student years, I wrote a novelisation of amedieval epic Dutch poem. I had intended it to be a fantasy masterpiece, exceptit came out as utter cack and was shelved for seventeen years… Scroll forwards, and by my late thirties, I was workingpart-time as a professional fundraiser, whilst developing property. My childrenwere toddlers. Then, just as I was about to apply for a loan to convert a smallold mill into flats, the housing market crashed, taking my full-time property magnateaspirations with it.My hopes of a new career were dashed. Or were they? Always an avid reader of children’s and crime fiction, Istarted to write. I wrote the sort of story I wanted to read and that I wouldlike to read to my children. My first stab was at a middle grade fairy-piratestory. I wrote it. I rewrote it. I penned a picture book and illustrated it.Sent both out to agents and got the odd personalised response back, but no joy.By then, I had started to think of myself as a writer, but I knew I still had alot to learn about the craft. Going back to my medieval Dutch fantasy novel seemed like asensible thing to do. Reworking it as a historical YA novel, I pitched it toagents. Close, but no cigar. Then, unwilling to give up, I went back to thefairy story, rewriting it until it became good enough to get me my first agent.She and I decided I should abandon it in favour of a new middle grade novelthat I already started. It was a detective story with a sci-fi twist. I was going to get published! Except I wasn’t. The novel never found a home. It had lost something in therewrites and never got it back. But that was okay, because then, I started anew middle grade novel! It was a story about a small red-headed boy calledArchie, who saw dead people. It was hilarious!It was definitelygoing to get published. Except it didn’t. It never even got submitted. I did, however, get a commission to pen the first six booksof HarperCollins Children’s Time-Huntersseries for 7+ year olds and those did get published. Hurray!They were going to be HUGE. Except they weren’t. I changed agent. Then, my second agent retired six monthslater and I had to change agent again. I stillhadn’t had a bona fide debut novel published!Always prolific and determined, in the interim, I hadwritten the complex, fast-paced crime thriller for adults that I had alwaysaspired to write. It had a working title of BlownAway and was about a heroic student at university in Amsterdam calledGeorgina McKenzie. Feeling certain that this novel was The One, I set off insearch of the right agent – someone I could click with; someone I could trustimplicitly; someone who shared my vision for George McKenzie and my future asan author. The novel was rejected time and again. It was too long. It was tooshort. It was too youthful. It was too dark. It wasn’t dark enough. I rewroteand rewrote and rewrote. It grew to 150K words. It shrank to 100K. It was thefinal edit, after two years of honing, that clinched it. I had two offerswithin a week. I went to London, I met both agents. I had already decided whichwould be the agent for me, by dint of his reputation preceding him and my owngut feeling, after our email correspondence. Meeting him confirmed that. Happydays. My publisher, Avon (HarperCollins’ commercial imprint)expressed a strong interest almost immediately! Except, it took aeons tonegotiate the deal. Far longer than I had anticipated. But yes, I got the dealand yes, I definitely was going to get published.So, the moral of this story about my own path to publicationis that good things do come to those who wait. Blown Away became The GirlWho Wouldn’t Die. For many weeks, it sat comfortably in the Kindle Top 100and then, went on to win a Dead Good Reader Award. It’s follow up - The Girl Who Broke the Rules - has beenreleased to great acclaim and has been in the Suspense Top 50 most of the timesince it’s late August publication. Hotly anticipated, The Girl Who Walked in the Shadows comes out in March 2016. Myeditor thinks it will be the biggest of the first three George McKenziethrillers.

{"title": "A Feline Fable: a guest post by author Sheila Norton", "date": "Wednesday 25 November 2015", "text": "I would like to welcome Sheila Norton to my blog today. Sheila's book Oliver the Cat Who Saved Christmas was published by Ebury Publishing on 22 October 2015. A Feline Fable(or how an old author learned some newtricks)By Sheila Norton‘A cat story? Why did you write a cat story?’ somebody askedme when my new book Oliver the Cat WhoSaved Christmas was about to be published. The answer was – because I wasasked to! True enough, I’d never have thought of writing it if an ex-editor ofmine hadn’t contacted me asking if I’d be interested in this project theywanted to commission. All my earlier novels were contemporary women’s fiction.Recently I’d written two books set in the 1960s, and a contemporary novel aboutgrandparents, but an adult Christmas story about cats? Different! Especially asthe story was to be narrated by a cat– something which, when I wrote short stories for magazines, was always adefinite ‘no’. It reminded me how fashions change in publishing; apparently thiswas now a new trend.Despite my surprise, I was very excited by the idea. I’m acat lover myself – I’d have to be, to even consider it. Although for lifestylereasons we don’t have cats now, my family have enjoyed the company of threecats over the years and as I started to write Oliver’s story, the memories oftheir little personalities came flooding back. Oliver had to be a very specialcat – one who could understand everything his humans said! But as the storyprogressed I became convinced that cats probably can understand Human, but to Oliver’s regret, humans never botherto learn Cat! Despite being narrated by a cat, the story is really, like all mynovels, about relationships, how people (and animals!) interact and manage theirlives.I can honestly say it was one of the most enjoyable novelsI’ve written. But there was a catch – a very tight deadline. For the proposedOctober publication date, it had to be completed by the 1st July, andit was already towards the end of March when the idea was put to me. But thebook didn’t need to be more than 60,000 words – quite short in novel terms –and with a synopsis agreed by the end of the month, I was ready to start work atthe beginning of April. Three months: 20,000 words per month. It was doable!I should probably mention here that I’m not used to workingto a deadline. I’m often asked when I give talks, how I schedule my writingwork, and the answer has always (up till now) been: I don’t! I was workingfull-time when my first six novels were published, and my editor was veryunderstanding. She’d ask whether a year was going to be enough, and I’d alwaysagree. I believe it’s important to be an easy author to work with – primadonnas don’t last long in this business. But the year between books gave meplenty of time, working evenings, weekends and days off. I write fast, andthose early books hardly needed any research, being about everyday characterswith all their laughs, loves and sorrows. Writing was how I relaxed after a dayat work, so I didn’t need to discipline myself to do it. Since retiring from the day job, I’ve had even less need toschedule my writing time, especially as some of the books I’ve written sincehave been self-published. I don’t have a particular time for writing. Some daysI do a lot, some days I don’t do any. My 1960s books certainly needed moreresearch than the contemporary ones. I did live through those years, which wasmy main reason for wanting to write them, but memories aren’t always accurate. Ticket to Ride, which is partly set inAustralia and concerns child migrants, needed the most research. I did it asneeded during the writing, rather than beforehand, apart from a trip toAustralia which was to visit family, but obviously helped with the background!So it’s been something of a surprise to me to find Iactually enjoyed working to such a tight deadline for Oliver, and in fact I finished ahead of time. Of course, I realiseI’m in an enviable position now I don’t have the constraints of a day job, butI’ve been there, done that! I also had to plan the story in some detail, as myeditor and I needed to be happy with the synopsis before I started. Therewouldn’t be time for any really major plot revisions later. This again was achange for me, having usually started with a vague storyline and let thecharacters lead the way. But the whole process has been so much fun, I’m hopingand planning to repeat it soon with another similar book. Which all just goesto show: you can teach an old dog (oran old author) new tricks. We never stop learning – and should never be afraidto try something different.About Sheila NortonSheila Norton lives near Chelmsford in Essex with herhusband, and worked for most of her life as a medical secretary, beforeretiring early to concentrate on her writing.

{"title": "My Writing and Publishing Journey: a guest post by Daniel Pembrey", "date": "Friday 20 November 2015", "text": "I would like to welcome Daniel Pembrey to my blog today. Daniel's Amsterdam detective series, The Harbour Master, is being published by No Exit Press in 2016.  His pre-Xmas short story - The Lion Hunter - was published on 19 November 2015 and is available from Amazon. My Writing and Publishing JourneyBy Daniel PembreyThank you for having me Vicki! Please allow me to introducemyself via my new book, which will help me tell you more about my background.I’ve just released a new, pre-Xmas short story called The Lion Hunter, which was inspired by acombination of Cecil the lion, a recent trip to Tanzania and my re-reading ofHemingway’s African short stories. It’s about a newly married British couplewho meet a Texan trophy hunter at a remote game lodge. The lion hunting turnsout to be less morally straightforward than the husband expects. It really isshort at approximately 40 pages. I loved writing it, and I love the creatureit’s based around (I’m a Leo!).The storytelling process has, for me, been a circular one –involving reading what I love to write, and writing what I love to read. I havealways enjoyed thrillers, but I’ve equally appreciated good travel writing.When I visit a place, I relish reading a strong story set there. I also gravitate towards novellas and short stories. I likenothing more than being gripped by a story during the course of a plane ortrain journey. And as an author, I feel lucky to be living in an era when thereis a viable market for them. (Before e-books, novellas were the realm of Hemingwayand perhaps Stephen King; now, with programmes such as Kindle Singles – Amazon’scurated, short e-book programme – they’re flourishing.)A few years ago, I started visiting Amsterdam; a closesister had moved there with her husband. I was struck by the dearth of crime fictionset in the Dutch capital in English translation. This surprised me because it’sone of northern Europe’s great port cities, lending itself so well to thegenre. I began writing a series of novellas about a stoic Dutchpolice detective called Henk van der Pol. He was inspired by the maverick copstories of Michael Connelly and Ian Rankin, not to mention the Scandinavian masterssuch as the late Henning Mankell. I was fortunate to have the first two booksaccepted as Kindle Singles. They sold well, the first one becoming the numberone short story on Amazon UK, and this in turn got me picked up by a good agent– Kirsty McLachlan at David Godwin Associates. The very ingredients that had brought me initial success –the novella length e-books, the high-selling Kindle Singles – turned into a headacheas my agent began submitting to publishers. While the publishers gave complimentaryfeedback about the story, they questioned how they could publish collections ofnovellas as novel-length print books (especially novellas that had already soldas e-books). This summer, I took part in BritCrime, the online crimewriting festival, founded by the wonderful Helen Smith. As well as being tremendousfun, the event created renewed focus on my HarbourMaster series among bloggers and readers. Not long after the BritCrimeevent, my agent received offers from two publishers, one of which was the specialistcrime publisher No Exit Press. They looked past the format of the individualbooks to see one continuous story. TheHarbour Master will be re-published next year.In parallel, I’m continuing with the Kindle Singlesprogramme – namely, The Lion Hunter.And I’m fortunate to have found support in a remarkable man named John Rendall,who walked a lion on London’s King’s Road back in the day! You may have heardof John; he ended up becoming a YouTube phenomenon. For the full story, see here … I’d encourage youto check out the video embedded in the article, it is the most remarkable storyof separation and reunion.

Hardisty to my blog today. Paul's book The Abrupt Physics of Dying was published in paperback by Orenda Books on 8 March 2015.  His next book - The Evolution of Fear - will be published in early 2016.Mark Twain Said It, Hemingway Bettered ItBy Paul E. HardistyIt was Mark Twain who said: write what youknow. Decades later, Hemingway,searching for the truest sentence he knew, bettered it. To EH, the essential question for a writerwas: ‘What do I know about and trulycare for the most?’ It took me ten years to write my debutnovel, The Abrupt Physics of Dying. Rather, I wrote it over a period of tenyears. The vast majority of that time wasn't spent writing, but working allover the world as an environmental and water resources engineer. Like most of us, I was exchanging time formoney, so I could feed and clothe my family, pay the mortgage.But I was also learning about the world,observing and recording, building knowledge and experience doing something Icared about. Working with the UN, I waslucky enough to go to Yemen, on the Southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula,right after the first Gulf War, and see first hand the effects of war and themass displacement of people. Over a fifteenyear period, I worked and travelled all over the region, and was in Yemen as the1994 civil war erupted. Those experienceseventually formed the core of my novel.When I heard that Abrupt Physics had been shortlisted for the prestigious CWA JohnCreasey New Blood Dagger award for best crime novel or thriller by a new authorin 2015, I was stunned. I thought back onthe years it took to find an agent, let alone a publisher. I reflected on the dozens of polite, oftencomplimentary and helpful rejections, and the most common reason given forturning me down: ‘It’s just toodifferent’. And I remembered how I feltat the time: saddened that I hadn’t been successful, but at the same timehugely buoyed, because that was exactly what I had been trying for:  something different. Something only I could write, born not onlyof the things I’d learned and done and seen, but from the deep passion I haddeveloped for social and environmental justice, and the plight of the lessfortunate, the disenfranchised, and the voiceless in our world.And so to the most recent, and in my viewdevastatingly difficult, variation on Mark Twain’s famous edict, this time fromMartin Amis: ‘Write about what you know so you don’t have to write what othersalready have.’ This is perhaps thehardest part of all, to avoid, as Amis put it, not only ‘clichés of the pen,but also of the mind and heart’. Ididn’t win the Dagger, but just getting that far was wonderful affirmation thatstriving for something different and fresh may be difficult, but it is worthit. As I put the finishing edits to my secondnovel, The Evolution of Fear (out inearly 2016), the voices of those masters continue to rattle around my brainlike a looping algorithm buried in a dream. I need to trust my voice, be steadfast in my attempts to integratescience and mathematics into prose and plot in a way that is non-threatening toreaders, because, yes, science can be beautiful. I must continue to write about issues that Icare about, without that passion taking over the story and becoming polemic. Ialso have to understand that there is a role for research – not everything you know has to come from first-handexperience. John Updike, after all,famously crammed himself full of several PhDs of research for each novel hewrote. And last, I need to remember thatafter all, this is fiction. It’s about making stuff up.  So, please, Messieurs Twain, Hemingway andAmis, be patient with a humble engineer who still learning the craft ofwriting, and has a long way to go.About Paul E.

But its portability makes it the perfect size for travel and a useful addition to any collection of larger adult colouring books.The book may be petite, but there are still plenty of pictures packed into its double-sided pages. As expected from the title, the pictures have a seasons theme, symbolising Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. The varied topics include the Chinese New Year, Easter, summer holidays, Halloween and Christmas.Each picture is beautifully drawn with some tiny details. This does mean that you need good eyes (or, if not, a magnifying glass) to do some of the colouring. You also need some very sharp pencils or pens with a very fine nib.I used WHSmith colour pencils, which blend well and come in a range of colours.I also used a mixture of Staedtler triplus colour pens, Staedtler Fineliners, Stabilo point88 pens and Uni-ball Signo Sparkling Gel Ink Rollerball pens.

But now that her mother is ill, she is forced to return home and come to terms with her guilt.

Louise's book How to be Brave was published by Orenda Books on 17 September 2015. Her book is a powerful story based on her experience with her own daughter's diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes and the true story of her grandfather, Colin.What is writing to me?By Louise BeechI read aninterview once where the writer was asked, Whatis writing to you?  Naturally, Iwondered the same.  What is writing to me? Because really it’s such a personal thing, and means different things todifferent people.  For some folks, writingmight be a hobby, a light pleasure.  Forsome, it might just be a job.  For others, escape, adventure, even therapy.  I thinkfor me, it is definitely the latter.And thosethree things came into play in a big way while I was writing the first draft ofHow to be Brave, my debut novel;because I approached such a hugely personal topic, one that I had neverexplored until then in great depth.  Mydaughter Katy’s Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis when she was seven.  And with World Diabetes Day on 14th November, it is very much on my mind again.It was ahorrible time.  That five-word sentence doeslittle to explain how horrible.  But hopefully the novel manages to.  In it, I created fictional mum and daughter -Rose and Natalie - who are going through such a diagnosis.  Type 1 is a much-misunderstood condition, oneoften confused with Type 2, which sometimes (but not always) can be caused by apoor diet.  Type 1 Diabetes is never caused by the person eating toomuch sugar - it’s an autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks thepancreas and the cells that make insulin. Injections are needed every day, forever.But while Iwanted to inspire and even educate, I didn’t want to bore readers with medicaljargon or an overload of information, so I let Rose and Natalie tell their ownstory, in a book nook where they cope with multiple injections by bringing tolife a long-gone ancestor.  GrandadColin’s true sea survival runs parallel to their daily struggle, the twostories often very similar.  First andforemos,t I wanted the book to be an adventure, a magical tale of bravery andlove.Whilewriting the first draft, I had a rigid routine with regards to the time I gave toit - five hours a day, every day except Sunday. But when it came to thestructure of my words, I was less orderly. I let them come as they must. Fall into the white screen in a tumble of tears.  Yes, I cried a great deal, reliving pain I’dignored for a long time.  Once it wasout, I went back and harshly edited, sculpting and chipping away until I washappy with my work.Writing isas much about editing as anything else. I think the first draft is like the undercoat we use when decorating.  It’s needed in order for the later colours toshine best.Whenthinking more about that interviewer’s question - what is writing to you? - it also occurred to me that I’m reachingout in my writing.  Saying all the thingsI’m not very good at saying; because I don’t explain very well or I’m tootongue-tied and nervous or get muddled with how I want to say it.  I was choked up when I wrote How to be Brave, filled with emotion.  But I was never tongue-tied, never got lost.  I realised it was an expression of love for mydaughter, and that I should share it. So I did. Because Isuppose it’s how I’m reaching out.  Bywriting.  It’s a way to be heard.  That’s what writing is.  It’s quiet, simple, and easy to me - and it’sso much louder than any shouts or screams or arguments or cries.  People listen when you write.  And you understand yourself better too.  Isn’t that the best reason ever to sit downat an empty screen?So on WorldDiabetes Day, I’m hoping that How to beBrave might touch, inspire, educate or help another child going through aType 1 diagnosis - or a parent having to witness it.  I hope I have written for you all, andwritten well.About Louise Beech (pictured below with her daughter Katie)LouiseBeech has always been haunted by the sea, and regularly writes travel piecesfor the Hull Daily Mail, where she was a columnist for ten years.

Her search leads to confront the darkresurgence of fascism, countered by the Jewish community in street battlesaround Ridley Road in the East End of London. Amid the growing tensions, canher love survive?My verdictRidley Road is a powerful story set in the 1960s, at a time when fascism and anti-semitism was spilling onto the streets of London.Young hairdresser Vivien moves to London from Manchester after her father dies. With few friends or relatives there, she is desperate to track down Jack Fox, a man she fell in love with some months before. But when Jack returned to London, he disappeared without a trace. I loved Vivien and Jack and their flourishing relationship during troublesome times. These two characters get inside your head, as they feel very real, and I desperately wanted them to find each other and stay together. I found the book's historical background fascinating - this was a subject I knew very little about.Ridley Road is exceptionally well plotted and written with tenderness. It's clear that the author not only knows her topic well, but cares greatly for it. Her writing gives you a real feel for 1960s London and its social history, with its descriptive language and colourful characters.

{"title": "'Playing Frankenstein': A feature by author Barbara Copperthwaite", "date": "Monday 9 November 2015", "text": "I would like to welcome Barbara Copperthwaite to my blog today to talk about her writing and editing process. Barbara's latest psychological thriller Flowers for the Dead was published on 2 September 2015.Playing Frankenstein: From first draft to finished bookBy Barbara CopperthwaiteEveryoneworks differently, and it’s important to find your own way of writing, a waythat works for you. For me, though, I like to think of the process of creating abook in the same way as creating a person from scratch. It is literally a bodyof work in my mind’s eye, and that thought helps me differentiate between theprocesses involved.Firstdraft: skeletonThe firstdraft is a little like a skeleton and major organs. Get this right and there isa strong base for everything else. Once you’ve finished, step back and try tolook at it as a whole. Are there bits that are in the wrong place and need tobe moved around? If a leg is in the wrong place, the person will fall over; if apart of the book is in the wrong place, it could make the story fall too.Seconddraft: fleshing outWith thesecond draft, I am adding muscle, nerves, veins and arteries. I am ‘fleshingout’ with all the wonderful detail that gives depth to a story and brings it tolife.Thirddraft: liposuctionNext willbe draft number three, where I cut out extraneous material – a bit likeliposuction for the body of the book. From paragraphs that add nothing, totightening sentences, to cutting repetition, every single word should work hardand have a reason for being; no flabby bits allowed! Editing:the beauty treatmentFinally Iwill be busy with the editing, a sort of beauty treatment: think deep cleanse,exfoliation, and moisturiser that will make the skin glow. Although Iam an indie publisher, I always use a professional editing service. It’sexpensive, but it’s the only way to produce a quality product. No matter howgood you are, no matter how full of praise/suggestions friends and family are,they can’t do the job of a professional editor. I’ve been a journalist for over20 years, and worked my way up to being an editor of several nationalmagazines, so I know all about proofreading, what makes a good story, pacing,copy editing, etc. I’ve done it to other people’s copy for years. And that’s iswhy I pay someone else to look at my work: because I know the importance ofusing expert people to carry out specific jobs. By the timeI send the book off to my editor, I’m exhausted, and the time they take lookingat it is both a welcome break away from the book, and a painful exercise inpatience (not something I am good at).At thispoint, the edit is about big picture stuff. Weakness in pace, plot,characterization, timeline issues etc are highlighted, and suggestions made.Don’t get defensive. Don’t think that they ‘just don’t get’ your book. Do readwhat has been said, take a deep breath, and read it a second time. Go for awalk, read it a third time, and put the whole thing aside for another week.Only then should you start work on making the changes. It’s good advice, givento me by my editor, and it works. Together,we are polishing my words, checking for mistakes, and getting everything justright so that the finished product is as close to perfect as it can be.Proofreading:the Spanx of editingYour novelhas a great body, has been buffed and polished, but to be really certain ofperfection, run it past a proofreader. They will spot all those annoyingrepetitions that you think you took out, but actually missed half of them, thetypos that your eye glides over, and a myriad of other things. It’s the final‘tightening’ of your copy.Clothingyour creationOf course,as an indie author, now my book is finished I shall have to work on the cover,and that's the clothing, hair and make up of the piece. I’m getting my bookready for her party, trying to create something eye-catching.Hopefully,she turns into the belle of the ball – and not Frankenstein’s monster.About Barbara CopperthwaiteBarbaraCopperthwaite wasraised by the sea and in the countryside, where she became a lover of both thewritten word and the great outdoors. When not writing feverishly, she is oftenfound hiding behind a camera, taking wildlife photographs.Herfascination with crime really began during a brief spell working in a men'sprison, and only grew when she became a national journalist and editor.

Only one will return. The couplethat offers the highest amount will see their daughter again. The losing couplewill not. Make no mistake. One child will die. Whennine-year-old best friends Charlie and Amy disappear, two families are plungedinto a living nightmare. A text message confirms the unthinkable; that thegirls are the victims of a terrifying kidnapping. And when asecond text message pits the two families against each other for the life oftheir children, the clock starts ticking for D.I. Kim Stone and the squad. Seeminglyoutwitted at every turn, as they uncover a trail of bodies, Stone realises thatthese ruthless killers might be the most deadly she has ever faced. And thattheir chances of bringing the girls home alive, are getting smaller by thehour… Untanglinga dark web of secrets from the families’ past might hold the key to solvingthis case. But can Kim stay alive long enough to do so? Or will someone’s childpay the ultimate price?My verdictI really enjoyed the first two books in Angela Marsons' DI Kim Stone series. Lost Girls was yet another brilliant read.This is the third in the series and could probably be read as a standalone. But I would urge you to read the first two books (Silent Scream and Evil Games) first, as they are also brilliant crime novels and provide background to the main characters.Two young girls go missing. Their parents receive several text messages from the kidnappers. The kidnappers demand that the parents outbid one another to determine which one of the girls gets to come home - and which one will die. DI Kim Stone and her team are given the task of trying to find the two best friends before it's too late.Angela Marsons' books get better and better. I love her style of writing, her believable flawed characters and her plot development. Lost Girls is very cleverly constructed and tackles a highly emotional issue. Every time something else happened to push the plot along, I kept thinking 'wow'. This is gripping and addictive reading, hard to put down. The abductors are suitably evil, yet still believable. And as expected, you get a roller coaster ride with plenty of twists and turns.I didn't want to finish the book too quickly though, as I now have to wait some time for the next in the series. I hope the Kim Stone series goes on and on.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher throughout NetGalley in exchange for an honest review"},

TheBlack Death changed many things, and just as it took away his father and elderbrothers, leaving Oswald to be recalled from the monastery where he expected tospend his life, so it has taken many of his villagers and servants. However,there is still the same amount of work to be done in the farms and fields, andthe few people left to do it think they should be paid more - something theKing himself has forbidden.Just asanger begins to spread, the story of the Butcher Bird takes flight. Peopleclaim to have witnessed a huge creature in the skies. A new-born baby is foundimpaled on a thorn bush. And then more children disappear.Convincedthe bird is just a superstitious rumour, Oswald must discover what is reallyhappening. He can expect no help from his snobbish mother and his schemingsister Clemence, who is determined to protect her own child, but happy toneglect her step-daughters.From theplague-ruined villages of Kent to the thief-infested streets of London and theluxurious bedchamber of a bewitching lady, Oswald's journey is full of danger,dark intrigue and shocking revelations.My verdictThe Butcher Bird is the second book in the Plague Land series. I loved the first book, and am delighted to say that The Butcher Bird is even better. You could read The Butcher Bird as a standalone, but it's definitely worth reading Plague Land first.In The Butcher Bird, we return to Oswald de Lacy, who is Lord of Somershill Manor. When a dead baby is found impaled on a thorn bush, the locals are convinced that this is the work of the terrifying butcher bird. But Oswald dismisses this as superstitious rumours and is determined to discover who is really behind the child's death.The Butcher Bird is set not long after The Black Death. The writing feels very authentic with its vivid descriptions of people and places. You feel like you've been transported back to that time period. The book is written so well that the facts are woven beautifully into the dialogue and narrative. You're not bogged down with lots of heavy passages (which you can find in other historical novels).The Butcher Bird is gruesome in places, but it also made me laugh. I love the interaction between the characters, particularly Oswald and his family. Oswald has a great sense of humour and also a sense of honour. He is determined to do the right thing and keep everyone happy.Plague Land and The Butcher Bird remind me of Lindsey Davis' Falco series, which is set in ancient Rome. Both series of novels are based on fact, written with humour and are fun to read with a brilliant loveable protagonist.I hope there will be another Oswald de Lacy book coming soon.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

I'll be taking part in NaNoWriMo - National NovelWriting Month - for the first time, along with over 300,000 other aspiring authors around theworld.  The aim is to write 50,000 words of a novel within 30 days. I maypost on my blog a bit more sporadically than usual. But I will be back!I waspersuaded to sign up for NaNoWriMo last December by bestselling crime fictionauthor Elizabeth Haynes – this year will be her 10th NaNoWriMo. You can read more about herthoughts and experiences on her blog by clicking here.My ultimatedream since childhood has been to write fiction. At university, I obtained aBSc. in Biomedical Science, with plans to follow on with a PhD in ForensicScience and then maybe write crime fiction one day. But in the final year of myBSc., I was sidetracked by the idea of a career in journalism. I went on tocomplete an MSc. in Science Communication, before working for consumer andpharmacy magazines, writing about health. Over the last 20 years, I havealso edited health books, magazines and websites. My non-fiction book onchildren's allergies was first published in 2009.LastDecember, I set up this book reviews blog to share my love of reading withanyone who's interested in books (and is prepared to listen). I review books and interviewauthors, and I'm often found tweeting about books and reading too. But reading novels still isn't enough for me. I still want to write anovel of my own.As a healthjournalist and editor, I’m used to writing and editing on a daily basis.Yet I still struggle to fit fiction writing into my daily life, alongsidefamily and work. I’m now hoping that this will change– that making a commitment to NaNoWriMo 2015 is my chance to get into a dailywriting routine.I have started several novels over the years, including a historical fiction novel, which is loosely based on the story of a great-uncle of mine during WW2. I'm still only around 30,000 words in and it's become a chore.Over the last year, I have been in contact with many authors (in the real and virtual worlds) – some established, some debut, some still looking to get published. I have asked many of them for advice on writing a first draft. The responses have included:\"Most first drafts are terrible, but don’t let that put you off\"\"Never give up. No matter if you believe the last 2,000 words you wrote are rubbish - leave them for 24 hours and then go back and read through. A few changes can make a world of difference.\"\"Write now, edit later.\" \"What you write at first will not be very good. If you think it is, you're doing it wrong. Keep going, persevere, and eventually something will work out. Don't try to be clever. Just write the story.\"\"Just get it out without judgement. You can worry about whether it's any good or not, and change it as many times as you like, once the words are on the page.\"So it seems that what I really need to do is blitz my first draft. And over the next few weeks (maybe months), I plan to do just that - with no editing along the way and very little research until it's finished. The editing and more research will come later, once I have written my story from beginning to end. I have a book idea buzzing around my head. I’m now desperate to bring the story and characters to life.Ican't put my life on hold completely over the next few weeks. But I can certainly commit myself to at least two hourswriting time every day, preferably first thing in the morning before my workbeckons. I have noidea if I'll achieve 50,000 words in 30 days. But I will certainly try my best. What's important to me is getting into a writing routine.Making fiction writing a priority in my life, yet still managing to achieve allmy work deadlines. I plan to keep up that writing routine long after NaNoWriMoends.So I'mheading into November with my laptop ready. And I'll see everyone on the other side- hopefully with around 50,000 words to show for it.This article first appeared on the Writers & Artists website blog -"},
{"title": "Being Patricia Cornwell's Editor - Depraved Heart BLOG TOUR", "date": "Friday 30 October 2015", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Patricia Cornwell's Depraved Heart, which was published on 22nd October 2015 by HarperCollins.I would like to welcome Julia Wisdom, publisher at HarperCollins to tell us what it's like to be Patricia Cornwell's editor.Being Patricia Cornwell’s EditorBy Julia Wisdom, Publisher, HarperCollinsBack in the 20th century – 1990, to be precise –when I was a young, impressionable and inexperienced editor, I read a debutthriller by an author called Patricia Cornwell.  The title was POST MORTEMand it was quite unlike anything I’d read before.  The central character,Medical Examiner Dr Kay Scarpetta, was completely original and I found herfascinating; the forensic detail felt precise and totally believable (in fact,as I’ve subsequently learnt, the forensics in all Cornwell’s books are 100%accurate); the story held me in a vicelike grip … And most of all it terrifiedme. No other thriller I’d read before had had such a powerful effect.  Itchannelled my scariest nightmare and it made me change two of the ways Ibehaved (to this day I still follow those practices).  Patricia went on to become a household name and a globalphenomenon.  I couldn’t even begin to guess how many millions of copiesshe’s sold worldwide, but I’ve never met anyone who hasn’t heard of her. Or herremarkable creation, Dr Kay Scarpetta.  It seemed unlikely I’d ever become her editor but two yearsago that’s exactly what happened.  Well,OK, that was quite a scary prospect. How to edit and successfully publishPatricia Cornwell?  Fortunately I’m surrounded by a highly professional,imaginative team of people from all the publishing disciplines – marketing andpublicity through to design through to sales – and we had great funbrainstorming ‘the essence of Patricia Cornwell’. We decided she was the Firstand the Best in the field of Forensic-based thrillers; that she was the ‘Expertin Death’. I learnt all sorts of things about Patricia, perhaps mostinterestingly that she practises what she writes: she road-tests the forensicstechnologies in her books; she can fly helicopters, scuba dive, shoot; she is aforensic consultant and much more.So far it’s been a blast.  The challenge has been togrow her already considerable readership, to reach those places not previouslyreached before, to be creative around the sorts of marketing employed – in bothour hardback campaigns so far we’ve tried to use truly innovative digitaladvertising  – and our cover approaches.  And most importantly the books remain powerful anddisturbing, clever and suspenseful, surprising and twisty.  I’m not soinexperienced now, and I’ve read a great many thrillers since first openingPOST MORTEM … but the ending of DEPRAVEDHEART still had the power to frighten me out of my wits.  Your chance to meet Patricia CornwellThis November, there are two events to meet Patricia Cornwell…. One in Manchesterand one in London.

The film clip and then others sent soon after raise dangerous legal implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her not knowing where to turn – not to her FBI husband Benton Wesley or her investigative partner Pete Marino. Not even Lucy.Scarpetta is now launched into intensely psychological odyssey that includes the mysterious death of a Hollywood mogul’s daughter, aircraft wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle, a grisly gift left in the back of a crime scene truck, and videos from the past that threaten to destroy Scarpetta’s entire world and everyone she loves."},

Is this the work of the beautiful and capricious Bea? Or is Abiwilling to go to any lengths to get attention?When thetruth outs, will either sister survive?My verdictThe Sisters is a fantastic psychological thriller. I admit that I wasn't sure about it at first, as it had a slow start. But gradually the layers unfolded and I couldn't put it down. By the end, I realised that the slow start actually builds the atmosphere and leads you into a false sense of security.This book seriously plays with your mind and messes with your head in true psychological thriller-style. It's cleverly plotted, very dark and intriguing - everyone seems so normal on the surface, but there are some highly menacing undertones.The chapters switch between the thoughts of Abi and Bea. Characters you thought you had sussed out are not necessarily what they seem. You switch between trusting one, then the other, then the first one again. But then the cycle continues.There are so many twists and turns, right up until the final page. This gave me a serious book hangover.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Helen MacKinven - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Wednesday 28 October 2015", "text": "I am delighted that HELEN MACKINVEN is joining me on my blog today, as part of her Blog Tour. Helen's book - The Talk of the Toun - is being published by Thunderpoint on 29 October 2015. So Helen, what inspired you to write fiction in the first place?I’ve always been a natural storyteller and prone toexaggeration so fiction lent itself to my love of sharing a good tale.What gave you the idea for Talk in the Toun?While studying for an MLitt in Creative Writing one of theassignments was to write an A to Z on any subject. My classmates wrote abouttheir interests such as music but I was initially stumped over what my‘Mastermind’ specialist subject would be. Then I realised that I had no troublewriting about my childhood memories so I used this theme to complete theassignment. The piece received my highest grade and I felt it reflected my writing‘voice’ so I decided to use it as a springboard into a fictional scenario ofgrowing up in 1980s central Scotland in a working class environment.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?I try to capture an authentic voice using Scots dialect.Do you have any strange writing habits?Each to their own madness so I wouldn’t describe this asparticularly strange but most of my creative writing is done at night. I liketo have a bath, get my jammies on, climb into bed with my dog Jess lying by myside and tap away on my laptop in silence.Are you a plotter or a pantser  Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?A bit of both. I start with a rough idea of where I wouldlike to go but I’m flexible with the plotting and happy to follow the charactersdown new paths as the story unfolds.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Staying focused and avoiding the distractions of socialmedia.Who are your favourite authors?I enjoy reading Scottish contemporary writers and admire thework of Jackie Kay, Anne Donovan, Janice Galloway and Karen Campbell.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?A Game of Two Halves in reference to the first 35 years ofmy life and with hopefully 35 more still to play out…What piece of advice would you give your younger self?Be more adventurous, travel more and don’t believe you’refat – you’ll wish you were still that ‘fat’ one day!What are your plans for your book's publication day?The publication day is also the date of my launch in theArgyle Street branch of Waterstones in Glasgow so I will be there celebratingwith family and friends who I hope will join me in a nearby pub after the eventfor a drink or two…What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Do your own thing – there are no rules! But I’d recommendhaving an insatiable appetite for reading as research to develop your ownwriting, connecting with other writers online and in person, taking notes ofideas and conversations overheard, reading your work aloud to check for rhythmand to weed out clunky phrases and not binning your teenage diaries like I did!And lastly, why should people read The Talk of the Toun?If you remember the angst of being a teenager at the stage inlife where big decisions can shape your destiny then you’ll enjoy reliving theemotional turmoil of growing up and exploring who you are and where you belong.It’s also great for wallowing in 80s nostalgia in the decade that style forgot.If you once danced to Spandau Ballet while wearing pixie boots, a frilly whiteshirt with huge shoulder pads, had your hair backcombed and wore electric bluemascara then be warned - you’ll experience flashbacks!About Helen MacKinvenHelenMacKinven writes contemporary Scottish fiction, with a particular interest inexploring themes such as social class and identity, using black comedy andfeaturing Scots dialect.

{"title": "Time to Die by Caroline Mitchell", "date": "Tuesday 27 October 2015", "text": "Time to DieBy Caroline MitchellPublished by Bookouture (24 September 2015)ISBN: 978-1910751428Publisher's descriptionHe willpredict your life… and your death.Don’t evercross his palm with silver.He willreveal your most shameful secrets.He willpredict your death.He ishiding a secret.He ishiding a monster.And all hispredictions come true.Investigatinga series of chilling murders, Detective Jennifer Knight finds herself trackinga mysterious tarot card reader known only as The Raven.As thedeath toll rises, Jennifer and her team build a picture of a serial killer onthe edge of sanity, driven by dark forces. But these are not randomkillings. And the method behind the madness could be the most terrifying thingof all …Especiallywhen it seems the death of one of their own is on the cards.My verdictTime to Die is even better than Caroline Mitchell's first novel. You could read it as a standalone, but you will probably enjoy it more if you read Don't Turn Around first.A tarot card reader calling himself 'The Raven' is correctly predicting people's deaths, and the body count is rising. But are these deaths driven by supernatural forces or is an evil serial killer on the loose? DC Jennifer Knight investigates as The Raven closes in and the victim choices become more personal.In Time to Die, it was a pleasure to return to familiar characters - Jennifer and her police partner Will. They're well-developed, likeable and believable, which makes the book so easy to read.  There's also a love interest, which provides some humour and a softer side to Jennifer's character, but I won't give away any spoilers here. The Raven is suitably creepy.I love the supernatural angle. Jennifer has psychic abilities herself and soon develops a link with The Raven. This becomes a gripping cat and mouse game that's full of surprises. What could be a standard crime novel turns into something quite dark. Caroline Mitchell is certainly knowledgeable about police procedures, but also has first-hand experience of the paranormal too (see her book Paranormal Intruder).The descriptions tackle all of your senses. It's just as well I don't get nightmares as this certainly keeps your heart racing. I would say it's perfect bedtime reading, but maybe not for the faint-hearted (read it with the lights on)!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - SD Sykes - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Sunday 25 October 2015", "text": "I am delighted that SD SYKES is joining me on my blog today for her blog tour. Her latest book - The Butcher Bird - was published by Hodder & Stoughton on 22 October 2015. Your first book – Plague Land – was published in September2014. What inspired you to write a crime novel set in the 14th century?I’ve always been drawn to medieval history. There’ssomething mysterious and magical about the architecture, literature and generalbeliefs of those times.  I also lovehistorical crime fiction, particularly the books of CJ Samson and ArianaFranklin – the idea of solving a murder, before the existence of forensics andthe police force, when only deduction and examination could provide the solution.  But, if I could pin down my inspiration toone moment, then it was watching a TV series called ‘Inside the Medieval Mind.’  The presenter, Professor Robert Bartlett,showed us a fourteenth century map, the ‘Mappa Mundi’, that is now held inHereford Cathedral. In one corner was the image of a man with the head of adog. A ‘Cynocephalus.’ A creature believed to live in the unmapped parts of theworld. A physical representation of the unknown. The ‘other.’ When I saw this,the idea to connect a crime with medieval superstition just leapt into my imagination.The Butcher Bird continues Oswald de Lacy’s story. When youwrote Plague Land, did you always intend for it to be the first in a series?I did.  Oswald is notthe usual type of detective. In fact, he begins his career in Plague Land by beingrather inept and reluctant, representing those situations that we all face,where we feel out of our depth, but must soldier on. But Oswald has innerstrengths.  He shows courage, whencourage doesn’t come easily to him, which makes him more of a hero to my mind. Iwould like to follow Oswald as he grows older, into a more seasoned and worldlydetective – though I don’t intend for him to ever completely lose that innervulnerability.How difficult has it been to research this time period andmake your books as authentic as possible?The chroniclers and historians of the fourteenth centurytended to forget about the lives of ordinary people.  Equally, most ordinary people wereilliterate, so did not leave their mark on the world. But there have been somesources that have been invaluable for filling these gaps about everyday life,and making my writing as authentic as possible. Firstly, the Canterbury Tales – written in the 1380s.  Wonderful bawdy tales of fourteenth century society.The Travels of Sir John Mandeville were also very useful – as Sir John recountsthe trip he apparently made to China (though it is doubtful he did, given someof his descriptions of foreign lands.) But my greatest source has been anilluminated manuscript ‘The Luttrell psalter.’ Created for a rich family in the 1340s, this prayer book is decoratedwith images of everyday rural life in remarkable detail. Drawn about themargins are kitchens, dining halls, watermills, farmers herding sheep, horsecarriages, bear-baiting etc, etc.  It’s likebeing transported back 680 years.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Pithy, pungent stories with energy and heart.Do you have any strange writing habits?I can only write the first draft of my novels in themornings, between 9am and 1pm. And I must have strong coffee!Are you a plotter or a pantser? Do you plot out the wholebook before you start or just start writing to see where it leads you?I am a plotter. In the past, I’ve written more scripts thannovels – and a screenplay or radio play usually starts with a ‘treatment’. Thisis where the story is dissected in detail, to ensure that the plot works. So, Ialways start my novels with this ‘treatment’ which is a long, chapter bychapter document. But I should also say that I don’t follow it slavishly. Ifbetter ideas come to me as I write – and they often do – then I absolutely usethem.Who are your favourite authors?I love (in no particular order): C J Sansom, Sarah Waters,Ariana Franklin, Anne Tyler, Karen Maitland, John Steinbeck, Antonia Hodgson,Martine Bailey, Jo Nesbo.If you were writing a book about your life, what would thetitle be?Ha! I’ve no idea. Actually, maybe that could be the title?How has your life changed since becoming a published author?My ‘writing time’ is much more easily defended than in thepast. These days, when I say I’m going into my office and I do not want to bedisturbed – my family seem to listen! Other than that, my life is pretty muchthe same as ever.What advice do you have for aspiring authors?It is simply this. Persevere. Keep writing. Every day. It’slike anything in life – the more you do something, the better you get.And lastly, why should people read The Butcher Bird?I’d like people to read The Butcher Bird, not because it’s abouthistory, but because it’s about people. It’s a crime thriller, that just happens to be set in 1351. There aremurders, lies, jealousies, love, sex and intrigue. As you follow Oswald and hisinvestigation, you will be transported back to the Kent of 1351 in theaftermath of the Black Death – as society tries to find its feet after one ofthe greatest plagues of all time. You will also visit the medieval walled cityof London, and join the hoards as they cross London bridge. You will go intocastles and hovels. You will drink ale and eat pottage. But most of all, as youtake this journey you will recognise these people as being just like you andme.About SD SykesSD Sykes lives in Kent with her family and various animals.She has done everything from professional dog-walking to co-founding her ownsuccessful business.

I'm a really big fan of the TV series, so I was very excited to be given the opportunity to review this book.When I first opened the book, all I could say was 'wow' for a while. Yes, it's gory. Yes, it's violent and graphic. But then if you watch The Walking Dead, this shouldn't come as a surprise.There are only five pages. But they're big ones. The closed book measures 24 cm x 28 cm. Open, it's around 47 cm x 28 cm. I could open and close each page for hours on end, carefully admiring the craftsmanship.I don't want to include many pictures in my review, simply because it may ruin for the experience and surprise for others. But here's just one of the pages (and this isn't a gory one on purpose):And here's a corner from another page, to give you an idea of the content and detail:Admittedly, you may not appreciate the content unless you're a big fan of the TV series. And the book isn't cheap. But the pages are certainly very cleverly engineered. It's a pop-up book for adults! Things to open, things to pull - oh, and of course some words to read too. But while there are snippets of information about The Walking Dead TV Series story inside, it's the pictures that really make the book stand out (literally). If you're already a fan, you'll know the story anyway.Just make sure you 'read' it carefully to keep the pages complete. Don't let the kids get it!This is a perfect present for fans of The Walking Dead.

It's a coming of age novel - how children's friendships change over the years and teenage girls grow up.Angela and Lorraine have been friends since early childhood, although they come from two very different social backgrounds. Angela has always seen herself as Lorraine's protector, but now the girls are 17 and Lorraine is maturing at a faster rate than her friend. As school, boys and families exert different pressures on their lives, Angela is struggling to accept that the two friends are going in different directions. And she has yet to discover that she relies on her friend far more than she realises.Talk of the Toun is a great laugh and fun to read, yet it also covers more serious underlying social issues. I found it easy to respond to the characters, and there are some very observant (and often hilarious) descriptions of people and places. I loved reminiscing about the 1980s clothes, hair, music and teenage lifestyle…The book made me laugh and cry.

The more Danielwrites, the more we learn about his past and the more we begin to fear forthose he holds dear.My verdictHow You See Me is an intriguing book. It's a psychological thriller, but one that involves reading between the lines.David Laird is writing letters to his sister, boss and Alice, his girlfriend. But you never get to read their replies, so only know his side of the story.This is a book about lies and deception. It makes you question everything you are reading and what should, or shouldn't, be believed. An unreliable narrator… or is he? You're never actually quite sure, even at the end.I enjoyed the book (although did think it could have been edited a bit more rigorously in places so that the writing was more succinct). I think of this as a 'Marmite' book - this won't appeal to everyone. It's not for you if you're looking for a fast-paced action-packed psychological thriller. You also need to be in the mood for it, as the plot isn't handed to you on a plate. It's certainly a book that makes you think.

And Down Among The Dead Men certainly hit the target for me, although it's very different from his Jessica Daniels series.You first meet Jason as a young boy. He's escaping from a group of thugs and is rescued by crime boss Harry Irwell. The book then switches between past and present, as you learn more about Jason's background and his current situation.

And when, soon after, a woman's body isdiscovered across town, stabbed to death, with her own baby missing, it looksas if Marla has done something truly terrible.But whilethe evidence seems overwhelming, David just can't believe that his cousin is amurderer. In which case, who did kill Rosemary Gaynor? And why did they thentake her baby and give it to Marla? With the police convinced they have an openand shut case, it's up to David to find out what really happened, but he soondiscovers that the truth could be even more disturbing...My verdictI'm a big fan of Linwood Barclay books and thought that Broken Promise was yet another great read.News reporter David Harwood has returned to his childhood town Broken Promise and moved back in with his parents. He's struggling to find a job but needs one urgently to give his young son a stable home. When his cousin Marla is accused of murder and kidnapping a baby, David isn't convinced that everything is what it seems. So he decides to investigate further, which ends up putting him and his family in danger.There are lots of characters, viewpoints and sub-plots, and it took me a while to get used to this. But by the end of the book, I felt I knew the characters well. The plot kept me intrigued, with murder, corruption, kidnapping and deception at the heart of it. As expected with Linwood Barclay books, there were lots of twists and turns. Admittedly I did guess a couple of these, but this didn't spoil my enjoyment as I raced to the end.All of the threads of the main plot are tied up by the final page, yet there's still an abrupt ending that does leave the reader hanging. Yes it is a little frustrating, but it does make me look forward to reading the next book in this series.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publish in exchange for an honest review.Read my interview with Linwood Barclay here."},

But when she takes a closer look she sees a talented,handsome man who outshines the string of jokers she's been dating.There'sjust one problem. Adam's job means Laura has to keep her job asrestaurant critic for The Dish, a secret. Tricky for someone who pridesherself on honesty.Can thetruth be put on ice long enough for love to flourish?And how canyou expect your boyfriend to be honest if you're not quite telling the truthyourself?My verdictThe Dish is a sweet 4* read, ideal for food lovers. Not to be read if you're trying to lose weight! Or at least, not when you're hungry!Laura Parker works as a food critic, but keeps her identity secret so that she can give an honest opinion about the restaurants she visits. But when she meets Adam Bayley, honesty doesn't seem to be the best policy for either of them. Not a good start to a new relationship...The Dish is an easy read with a well-structured plot. It contains observant narrative, well-developed warm characters and great descriptions of food. The story is a bit predictable and maybe a little longer than it needed to be. In certain places, there are email exchanges that could have been cut out to move the story along a bit more quickly.But overall, I enjoyed The Dish and it provided perfect escapism for an afternoon. It's a far 'meatier' read than other books labelled as 'chick lit'.

Emma O'Donovan is eighteenyears old, beautiful, happy, confident.One night,there's a party. Everyone is there. All eyes are on Emma.The nextmorning, she wakes on the front porch of her house. She can't remember whathappened, she doesn't know how she got there.She doesn'tknow why she's in pain.Buteveryone else does. Photographs taken at the party show, in explicit detail,what happened to Emma that night.Butsometimes people don't want to believe what is right in front of them,especially when the truth concerns the town's heroes . . .My verdictI was told by a friend (Liz of Liz Loves Books) that Asking For It was a book that I HAD to read. Not just me, but everyone. So I bought it. And yes, I agree. Asking For It IS a book that has to be read.I read this in one sitting. It's thought provoking, sensitive and emotional. It's a Young Adult book, but shouldn't be viewed in that way as it tackles some serious issues about 'consent' and whether a girl or woman can be 'asking for it '. Can a girl deserve everything she gets because she's not always the nicest of people? Because she wore the wrong clothes?  Because she drank too much? Or just because…? And what if the perpetrators of this crime are the town's heroes, the golden kids who can do no wrong?Louise O'Neill has deliberately created Emma, her main character, to pose these questions. And she isn't afraid to cover a controversial topic, bringing it into the public domain.Asking For It has a simple enough plot. It's graphic in places, but no more than it needs to be. To shock. To have impact. The actions of the teenagers in the book may shock the reader. But they also have an impact on their whole community, not just them and their families.This is a book that pulls at your heartstrings and leaves you with tear-sodden tissues and a thumping heart. The ending is ambiguous, yet I feel it's meant to be - it leaves you thinking, to make up your mind about the future. But will it be the one you expect?Look out for the #NotAskingForIt on Twitter."},

Hovering on the brink, the rare booksdealer turns out to be Detectives Sinclair and Alvarez's best hope of findingout what linked these unlikely victims, and who wanted them dead and why.

The surviving victim seems to be the detectives' best hope to find out why. The race is on to stop more bombings and uncover the perpetrator.The plot focuses on religious cults and counterfeiting. Its multiple layers are gradually peeled back to reveal the underlying reasons for the bombings. Thanks to the 1980s setting, the detectives have to use old-fashioned techniques of interviewing all suspects, assessing crime scenes on site and putting all the clues together to solve the crime.I enjoyed the authentic 1980s feel and the book was well written and well plotted. But having read some other reviews, I expected the book to have more of a wow factor. I don't think I connected with any of the characters, although Clark was a real scoundrel at heart and some of his actions made me laugh. Yet I still give the book four stars for its originality. It's a great debut.I received an Advance Reader Copy from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

This one aims to provide some background information on anxiety and stress relief, rather than just pictures to colour. So it's a good choice for people who are looking for some health advice too.On the left hand pages, there's health information and useful tips on anxiety and stress and ways to cope (such as colouring, arts and crafts, gardening, pet therapy and cups of tea!). Then on the right hand pages, there are the illustrations to colour - these pictures fit in well with the text (e.g. pet pictures for the pet section, gardening pictures for the gardening section etc). The layout of the book means that the colouring pages are one sided, so it doesn't matter too much if the colouring seeps through the page.The pictures are well-drawn with some intricate detail. For the picture below, I used a mixture of Staedtler triplus colour pens, Staedtler Fineliners and Crayola washable pens. The pens didn't go through the page at all. I haven't quite finished colouring the picture, but this gives you a good idea of the content.For the following picture, I used WHSmith colour pencils (which are brilliant if you're on a budget) and Derwent Academy Colour Pencils (which are a bit more expensive).Here's another picture, which I have yet to colour. It's not a great photo, but you can see the detail of the background and wallpaper, as well as the dogs in the foreground.Overall, this is a great colouring book containing fun detailed pictures. It's a good size as it's not very bulky and, if you suffer from anxiety or stress, you may benefit from the useful lifestyle tips too. Sarah Rayner has also written a book called Making Friends with Anxiety, containing tips, exercises and anecdotes.I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review."},

Her testimonyhelped to put a dangerous criminal behind bars - or so she thought.Now,decades later the black-eyed susans planted outside Tessa's bedroom window seemto be a message from a killer who should be safely in prison.Haunted byfragmented memories of the night she was attacked and terrified for her ownteenage daughter's safety, can Tessa uncover the truth about the killer beforeit's too late?My verdictBlack-Eyed Susans started off slowly but turned into a gripping and creepy psychological thriller.Tessa has never fully recovered from her narrow escape from a serial killer when she was 17. Left to die with three other girls, she was dubbed a 'Black-Eyed Susan' by the media, as their bodies were found in a field covered with these flowers. She was the only one to survive. Now decades later, she can still barely remember anything about her experience. When Black-Eyed Susans are planted outside her window, it seems that the convicted killer (still behind bars) may not be guilty after all.This is a complex thriller with well-developed characters and an intriguing plot. The chapters alternate between 17-year-old 'Tessie' and Tessa in the present day. When it becomes apparent that the original killer may be on the loose, Tessa is concerned about the safety of her 14-year-old daughter. She is also obsessed with memories of her childhood friend Lydia, who vanished without a trace soon after the serial killer was put behind bars.This is a book that you need to concentrate on. Layer by layer, the author builds a picture of Tessa and her life then alongside her life now. The narrative is highly detailed, with fascinating well-researched forensics. I did eventually guess part of the twist, but not all of it, and the ending was still a complete surprise.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Clare Pedrick", "date": "Thursday 8 October 2015", "text": "I am delighted that CLARE PEDRICK is joining me on my blog today. Clare's book - Chickens Eat Pasta - was published by Troubador Publishing on 28 July 2015. So Clare, what inspired you towrite your book Chickens Eat Pasta?Well the story behind the book is quite an unusual one. It’sthe tale of how I got on a plane to Italy when I was still in my mid-twenties,and for some unfathomable reason – and I still can’t really explain why -bought an old ruin outside a tiny hill village in what was then, and in manyrespects still is, one of the most remote parts of rural Umbria. People have oftenasked me how I ended up living here, and what brought me here in the firstplace. And whenever I recount the story, it has always met with a very positiveresponse, not least because there’s a strong love interest in the tale. Sowriting this book has always been in the back of my mind. How much did you planyour book before you started writing? I actually started writing this book a number of years ago.But finishing it and knocking it into the kind of shape that would satisfy meand my reading public was quite another matter. I did plan it, at the beginning,but then it got put on hold while I had children and got on with my career as ajournalist, and by the time I fished it out again, other events had taken over,and the way I saw the book developing had also changed in many  ways. In the end, I wrote five versions, soalthough the core remained what I had planned at the outset, the way I actuallypresented the  story was quite different– and I think much better.  Chickens Eat Pasta isa memoir of your decision to buy an old house in a remote village in Umbria,Italy. Do you have any plans to write another book? If so, which genre wouldyou choose?To be honest, writing this book while carrying on with allmy other work and family commitments has been so demanding that I can’t reallyget to grips with the idea of writing another one just yet. But working withwords is something that I have always done, and producing a book has beenimmensely satisfying. So I may well write another book at some stage. I lovethe travelogue style of Bruce Chatwin, H.V. Morton and Eric Newby, to name buta few, so that’s a genre that will always draw me in. But I would also like totry my hand at writing fiction, and I have a few ideas milling around in myhead. Do you have anystrange writing habits?As a journalist, I’m quiet disciplined about my writing, andhaving been brought up having to get stories out quickly in a noisy newsroom, Idon’t have any real need for perfect conditions, such as complete silence, orsoothing music. I write better in the mornings, but I can also write in theevenings, preferably with a glass of good Umbrian white wine at my side!  Describe your writingstyle in 10 words or less?Yikes! Well I would like to think that it is fluid andevocative, with plenty of description and dialogue.Looking back, whatadvice would you give your younger self?I suppose I could wish that I had been less impetuous. Butof course, if I’d followed that advice, then none of what became my adventurebuying up the old ruin in Italy and all that it led to would ever havehappened! I would probably have had an easier life if that had been the case.But I firmly believe that the smoothest path isn’t always the happiest one. How has your lifechanged since becoming a published author?It’s certainly become a busier one. I naively thought thatwriting the book would be the difficult part, and that the hard graft wouldfinish there. How wrong I was! Because as any author knows, especially an indieone, there is a great deal of work to be done in actually getting the book outto the readers. Having said that, I’m not complaining, as this journey hasconnected me with a whole new community of other authors and book bloggers, whoare incredibly supportive, and many of them are doing some extremelyinteresting things. I’ve also derived a great deal of pleasure from hearingfeedback about my book, most of which, I’m glad to say, has been extremelyencouraging, and its release has put me back in touch with people with whom I’dlost contact, including many who have been to my house in Umbria, and arefamiliar with some of the places and characters in the story. I often ask authors –‘If you were writing a book about your life, what would the title be’ – butyou’ve already done that! So my question is: Why did you choose this title?That’s an easy one. The title – Chickens Eat Pasta – refersto a video that I saw of chickens eating spaghetti in a tiny mediaeval hillvillage in rural Umbria. It was a rainy November morning in England, and thevideo just intrigued me. That’s really what sparked this whole adventure off inthe first place. When I arrived in that village just a few days afterwards, Isaw that it was true. Chickens really did eat pasta in that part of Italy. Andto my utter amazement, so did dogs. The village shop had huge sacks of specialpasta for dogs. I don’t know why, but it caught my imagination. What advice do youhave for aspiring writers?I think a great many people would love to write a book, butthey are put off because they don’t think they’re good enough, or they’reworried that they won’t find a publisher. I suspect that there are manyfascinating untold stories out there, and of course self-publishing hasdrastically shifted the goalposts. So I would say, if you think you have a bookinside you, be it a children’s story or a novel or a memoir, go ahead and writeit. Because if you don’t, you’ll always wish that you had.And lastly, whyshould people read Chickens Eat Pasta?People tell me that Chickens Eat Pasta is quite an inspiringstory, of how following your intuition can lead to happiness, and in this caselove. Although it’s a fairly easy read, I think it’s one that carries you alongand stirs a wide range of emotions. I’ve heard some readers tell me that theywere alternately crying and laughing as they turned the pages. And of courseit’s also a form of vicarious travelling, as the story is set in anextraordinarily beautiful part of Italy, which is still very much untouched anduntamed, and it conjures up a way of life that is so different from thatexperienced by most people. So if nothing else, I think the book is a prettygood holiday read, though I hope it’s a bit more than that. It’s also quite acompelling love story, with the house and with the man I met there. But it’snot a sugar-coated tale. That’s not the way it was at all, so the book is quitean honest portrait of all the challenges along the way, and I think that hasstruck a chord with quite a few readers.  About Clare PedrickClare Pedrick is a British journalist who studied Italian at Cambridge Universitybefore becoming a reporter. She went on to work as the Rome correspondent forthe Washington Post and as European Editor of an international featuresagency. She still lives in Italy with her husband, whom she met in the villagewhere she bought her houseFollow Clare on Twitter - @ClarePedrickChickens Eat PastaPublished by Troubador Publishing (28 July 2015)Synopsis: ClarePedrick was just 26 years old when she decided to buy a beautiful old ruin inUmbria on a whim after spotting a newspaper advert one rainy Sunday morning.She was entirely alone when she embarked on her adventure, which eventually ledto a love affair with a man who is now her husband.Unlike someother recent bestsellers, this is not simply an account of a foreigner’s moveto Italy, but a love story written from the unusual perspective of both withinand outside of the story. As events unfold, the strong storyline carries withit a rich portrayal of Italian life from the inside, with a supporting cast ofmemorable characters. Along the way, the book explores and captures the warmthand colour of Italy, as well as some of the cultural differences – betweenEngland and Italy, but also between regional Italian lifestyles and behaviour.It is a story with a happy ending. The author and her husband are stillmarried, with three children, who love the old house on the hill (now muchrestored) almost as much as she does."},

Helikes driving slowly, playing Sudoku on his iPhone, swapping one scruffy jumperfor another. He's been with Clara for four years and he's been perfectly happy;but now she's left him, leaving nothing but a long letter filled withincriminations and a small, white, almost hairless dog, named Doggo. So now Danis single, a man without any kind of partner whether working or in love. He'sjust one reluctant dog owner. Find a new home for him, that's the plan. Comeon...everyone knows the old adage about the best laid plans and besides, Doggois one special kind of a four legged friend...and an inspiration.My verdictWaiting for Doggo is a feel-good read about loyalty, love and honesty.Dan thinks he's settled down with his girlfriend Clara, until she suddenly walks out on him, leaving nothing other than a note and a rescue dog called Doggo. Doggo isn't exactly blessed in the looks department (in fact, he's rather ugly) but he makes up for that with his loyalty and companionship.  Clara gave Dan strict instructions not to leave Doggo home alone. So when he moves to a new job in advertising, Doggo goes with him - and quickly becomes the star of the office and the star of the book.The writing is quirky, tender and perceptive, without being overly sentimental and slushy. The characters are realistic and believable. This is a shortish book, but is full of humour and packs a lot into its 200 or so pages.This is a story about discovering who you are and what you want out of life. It's a brilliant read.I received an Advance Reader Copy through Bookbridgr and through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Here is an article I wrote for another book blog last week - From First Page to Last - all about the enjoyment of starting a new crime series from the beginning.As a book blogger, I often get asked to review a crime novel that's the latest in an established series. Not all book bloggers will do this. But I'm usually happy to read the book as a standalone, knowing nothing about the previous books' plots or characters. After all, this is how many new readers first encounter a crime series, picking up the latest novel on the 'Bestsellers' shelf.Authors usually set out to make sure their new readers will enjoy the latest book as much as existing fans. Most of the time this works well for me, since the authors are able to provide enough background to keep me satisfied. I may even enjoy the latest book so much that I then buy the previous books too. But occasionally I am left with unanswered questions, which leaves me frustrated.Sometimes it's good to set aside time to read an ongoing series from the beginning - and hope that I'll catch up before the next book is published.Around 18 months ago, I downloaded Ben Aaronovitch's first Rivers of London novel onto my Kindle, with every intention of reading it straight away. Yet thanks to my book addiction, and also becoming a book blogger, it's been festering on my Kindle ever since. Until a few weeks ago, when I finally decided to take the plunge, ignoring my 'more urgent' TBR pile.For anyone who doesn't know, the Rivers of London series was launched in 2011. It's published by Gollancz (an Orion imprint). The 5th book was published in paperback in July 2015. The next book - The Hanging Tree  - will be published in June 2016.This is a crime series with a supernatural element. It follows the adventures of Peter Grant, a Detective Constable and new trainee wizard. So far in the first book, I've met lots of intriguing characters and visited some dark, mysterious places, as Peter Grant is being exposed to magic for the first time. I love the humour and also that the book is set in London, with its familiar landmarks (as this is where I live).Since there are five published books in the Rivers of London series so far, I still have a long way to go before I catch up. With my current TBR pile of review books (both printed books and e-books), it's likely to take me a while. But I'm looking forward to enjoying the journey along the Rivers of London - and according to some of my blogger friends, I won't be disappointed.Visit From First Page to Last by clicking here - it's a great book blog."},

I read it slowly, as I didn't want it to end.I loved the opening chapter, which introduces the reader to the characters, setting the scene beautifully. It really grabbed my attention and pulled me straight into the plot, desperate to read more.Detective Sergeant Lee Jamieson has returned to his roots, following a promotion at work.

He is swiftly drawn into an investigation involving a web of crime on the housing estate. Unfortunately he also falls for Nicola Kelly, whose husband is a well-known local villain.The Prodigal is a book about murder, crime, love and lust. The author has a great way of showing not telling and grabs the reader by all of the senses. The narrative is hard hitting and very real, yet is also compassionate and humorous at times. The book is fast paced and gritty, yet an enjoyable read, not as heavy as some crime novels with similar themes.  The characters are well developed too - and you actually care about what happens to them by the end, even the bad ones.I'm hoping there's another book to follow, as this was such a pleasure to read.I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review."},

Only by using her imagination, newspaper clippings, letters and thisdiary will Natalie share the true story of Grandad Colin's survival at sea, andhelp her daughter cope with her illness and, indeed, survive.My verdictWow, it's been difficult to write a review for How To Be Brave as there's so much I want to say. To summarise though, I loved it from start to finish. It's beautifully written, heartwarming and passionate.Natalie and her daughter Rose are having to come to terms with Rose's diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. The painful and time-consuming regime of blood glucose testing and insulin injections have a major impact on their lives. The author has experienced this emotional turmoil herself, so it's not surprising that the writing is sensitive, yet also informative. To add to their stress, Natalie's husband Jake can't get home from Afghanistan to be with his family.This powerful story alone would give anyone a reason to read How To Be Brave, especially if they or a relative or friend has had to deal with a similar diagnosis. But on top of this, there's the story of Natalie's grandfather Colin, who was stranded on a lifeboat at sea for several weeks in 1943, after a U-boat attack. He and his comrades were starving, thirsty and convinced they were all going to die.When Natalie and Rose find Colin's diary, they embark on a journey to remember. Not only does this enable them to learn more about Colin's fascinating experiences, but it helps them come to terms with Rose's future.How To Be Brave is a book about hope, courage, acceptance and love. The two story strands overlap seamlessly and the book is exceptionally well planned and well executed.I think this is an amazing debut.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},

Mute and covered inbruises, she has no memory of who she is or how she got there. The only clue toher identity is the Danish lullaby she sings...Inside thecare home, she should be safe. But, harassed by the media and treated as anuisance by under-pressure staff, she finds the home is far from a haven. Andas her memories slowly surface, the Lullaby Girl does her best to submerge themagain. Some things are too terrible to remember... but unless she confronts herfear, how can she find out who she really is?My verdictLullaby Girl is a haunting tale but won't be for all psychological thriller fans. It intrigued me enough to read from beginning to end. But it's dark and bleak, so not ideal if you want an uplifting read.A girl is found on the banks of a remote lock in Scotland. She's injured, mute and suffering from amnesia. She's moved to a care home, where she should be safe from the media. Yet she remains treated with suspicion while she recovers, and not everyone at the home is welcoming.The girl, Kathy, is fragile in body, spirit and mind. As the narrative switches between past and present, she gradually begins to remember snippets from her past. And then realises that her life could be in danger.Lullaby Girl had an interesting plot. But it did leave me with a few unanswered questions. Difficult to mention most of them without giving away spoilers. But I was surprised that the police didn't take more of an active role in the case and check on her welfare.The book is fairly well-written, but some of the dialogue irritated me a little. Kathy speaks with a slow, drawl and lisp at the start, which then vanishes by the end of the book. This may have been due to her post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, which then disappeared as she discovered who she was and took back control over her life.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

She thought, and thought, and then, though she didn't know why, shewrote: 'I want to be thin.' Over the next twelve years, she developed anorexianervosa, was hospitalised, and finally swung the other way towards bulimianervosa. She left school, rejoined school; went in and out of therapy; ebbed inand out of life. From the bleak reality of a body breaking down to the electricmental highs of starvation, hers has been a life held in thrall by food.My verdictThe Time In Between is certainly not light reading. It's an honest account of how a young girl decides that she wants to be thin at the age of eight. She embarks on a mission that leads her into anorexia and then bulimia over the following 12 years.Nancy Tucker was a very bright child, striving to be perfect in every possible way. Yet despite her early academic achievements, she felt that she disappeared into the background - and believed that being perfect physically too would enable her to shine. As she spurns food, her health begins to suffer and then spirals completely out of control.  Unfortunately there's no solution or happy ending. And Nancy is left with the ultimate decision - to live or not to live.This is a graphic and often upsetting look at how eating disorders have a major, and tragic, impact on people's lives (as well as their families). Yet it's written with sensitivity and gentle humour by Nancy herself, and is certainly a fascinating read. Nancy wasn't influenced by the media, or pictures of models, but simply thought that being thin would make her stand out from the crowd, as well as make her happy. Sadly Nancy had to discover the truth the hard way.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

Anna's partner Esko isentrenched in a similarly dangerous investigation. As the two cases cometogether, it becomes clear that having the law on their side may not be enough.My verdictThe Defenceless is an intriguing and atmospheric Scandi-noir novel with a tight complex plot. It's so well translated that it's easy to forget that it wasn't originally written in English.Anna Fekete is investigating a seemingly straightforward hit-and-run accident - an elderly man has been found dead in the road after being run over by a Hungarian au pair. But as time progresses, it transpires that this isn't as clear cut as originally believed. Throw in some drug addicts and murder, and the case becomes increasingly complicated. Anna's partner Esko, meanwhile, is investigating the Black Cobras, a crime syndicate (of immigrants) trying to get a foothold in Finland.The Defenceless' publication is very timely, with the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis in Europe. The plot focuses on illegal immigration, with refugees fleeing from conflict, and addresses some serious moral and social issues.The author Kati Hiekkapelto has created some well-developed characters, highlighting their flaws and anxieties. As the plot progresses, Anna Fekete questions her own status in Finnish society, being an immigrant herself, having originally fled from a war zone.This book is more than just a crime novel. It's a fascinating insight into what's below the surface of the society that we live in - every migrant/refugee has a story, so what leads them to flee a country that they know and love.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour:"},

And with thecase growing ever more complicated, George must walk the halls of Broadmoorpsychiatric hospital, seeking advice from the brilliant serial murderer, Dr.Silas Holm…My verdictReading The Girl Who Broke The Rules was like coming back to an old friend. I think this book is even better than the first in the series. It can be read as a standalone. But if you haven't read the first book (The Girl Who Wouldn't Die), I suggest you read this before The Girl Who Broke The Rules to help you understand the main characters' backgrounds.Yet again, the reader is transported between the dual locations of London and Amsterdam, following an investigation into a series of gruesome crimes. George is in London researching pornography among violent sex offenders for her PhD, but a disturbing case leads her to join Chief Inspector Paul van den Bergen in Amsterdam. Women are being brutally butchered, and certain evidence leads the police to suspect that this could be linked with human trafficking.Both George and van den Bergen's personal lives are a mess. George's relationship with her boyfriend Ad is in jeopardy and van den Bergen is paranoid about his health. George is brash and hard as nails with plenty of attitude, a consequence of her difficult upbringing, and very different to sensitive van den Bergen (who is old enough to be her father). Yet not only are they friends and work colleagues, but it's clear that they are attracted to one another too.The writing is fast-paced and highly readable with some graphic and gory descriptions. As the story progresses, the tension builds up and the body count rises. I had no idea about the identity of the murderer, and the culprit was a complete surprise.The ending is also shocking and totally unexpected. Be warned that it will leave you hanging.

A series of disasters lead Angie and Fiona to learn a lot about themselves, their lives and about their loved ones.Rules For Thursday Lovers reminded me of a Carry On film. It's a bit predictable in places but this just seemed to add to the entertainment. I was surprised that Angie agreed to Fiona's idea in the first place, as the women hadn't seen each other for years and Angie didn't seem like a naturally adventurous person. She certainly surprised me bwith her enthusiasm.Some of the subplots weren't always easy to follow and seemed to go a little off tangent until the end, when everything came together.

Can he once again become the man hiswife fell in love with, or has he left it too late?My verdictI loved My Everything. It's highly thought provoking - one of those 'what if' books that feels very real and touches your heart.The night before Hannah plans to leave her husband Tom, he suffers a devastating stroke at the age of 32. Hannah has to rethink her plans - all her hopes and dreams are shattered in a moment. She feels that she can't leave Tom at a time when he needs her most.My Everything is an intriguing and believable story that's written with great tenderness.

Can they, and their relationship, change again, as Tom makes that long journey back to health? Or is it time for both of them to move on?The book is beautifully written and I didn't want it to end. This is a story about guilt, love, regret, friendship and hope. It's about pursuing your dreams and following your heart - finding out who are you and not letting others define you. It's one of those books that makes you think about your own life - whether you're achieving your own dreams and, if not, what you can do about it.

But I did find the speed of the writing picked up in the middle half of the book.Claire's sister Julie disappeared 20 years ago and no one knows what happened to her. Claire is now happily married. But then her husband Paul is killed in a seemingly random mugging attack. As Claire comes to terms with her loss, the local police don't seem to be making any progress in the investigations. And when Claire starts delving more into her husband's life, she makes several horrific discoveries.Overall I did enjoy Pretty Girls, although it wasn't a 'wow' read for me. The plot is graphic, dark and gruesome in places. It does become rather unbelievable, but then you just have to go with the flow and enjoy the ride. It certainly has some great twists and turns and leaves you on the edge of your seat.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

It's chilling and intriguing and left me tingling with anticipation. The rest of the book moves at a steady pace, covering interesting social issues, such as homelessness and mental illness, and (as expected) murder.I have never been to Glasgow (or Scotland, even) and the author describes it vividly.

As expected after reading reviews of Simon Toyne's Sanctus trilogy, Solomon Creed gripped me from the first chapter and captured my attention all the way through.Solomon Creed walks away from a plane crash.

All he knows, after combining the facts with his gut instinct, is that he is there to save one man. Until he discovers that this man is already dead.

Interspersed between the modern-day chapters are the memoirs of Reverend Jack 'King' Cassidy, the founder and first citizen of Redemption. I loved the descriptions of the town and its surrounding desert landscape. I could visualise these, and the events, in my mind, which is always the sign of a well-written book.The story builds up layer by layer, with a few surprises along the way.

In summer it was too hot to go out and, with time on myhands and missing my own language, I just decided to immerse myself.Where do your ideas come from?Tricky. Where do ideas come from? The big wide world is theeasy answer, but from the depths of my psyche is the more honest one.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?I’m not sure you can write anything without your personalexperiences influencing your work. I am my work and my work is me.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Atmospheric, tension-filled,intimate and emotional.Do you have any strange writing habits?Writing is pretty strange full stop. The usual middle of thenight stuff when my brain is firing ideas at me.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?A mix of both. I have an outline and some key scenes inmind, then I write. After I while I assess where I am and where I need to go,and then I work out how to get there. I always have a sense of the heart of thestory before I begin.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?The planning. It gives me brain ache.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I LOVE reading, but it’s really hard to write and read. Iread when I can and look forward to it as a treat. I enjoy Sarah Waters andRachel Joyce but many others too.You were born in Malaya, which is the setting for your first book, The Separation. What memories do you have of your time living there?Wonderful memories of sun, sea and freedom. I loved Malaya.It’s in my soul.The Tea Planter's Wife is set in Ceylon. Why did you choose this as the setting for your second novel?I wanted to stay with South East Asia and as I knew solittle about Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and really wanted to go there, I plumpedfor that. Since then I’ve been to Vietnam for book three, and I have a trip toIndia coming up. I NEVER expected all this when I set out to write and I feelincredibly fortunate.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?Pass!What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Being a published writer is fabulous, but you do need doggeddetermination and a well-honed degree of obsession.  By writing you learn how, so keep at it anddevelop a feeling for your strengths and your weaknesses. The way I feel aboutit is that I can’t not write, and I’m never satisfied with early drafts. Thatmight be the key.And lastly, why should people read The Tea Planter's Wife?If you’re looking for mystery, love, heart-break and joy – thenit’s for you. But I think Liz Trenow’s words say more than I can.Liz Trenow author of The Poppy Factory:‘Witha naïve young woman protagonist discovering the undercurrents of a tropicalland and a husband haunted by the tragedies of a previous marriage, The Tea Planter’s Wife cleverly meldsthemes from A Passage to India and Rebecca into a highly engaging story,informed by meticulous research and a real feel for the setting of Sri Lanka,when it was still Ceylon. Dark secrets lie at every turn, hidden beneath layersof 1920s racism and the fearfulness of a crumbling colonial power, making for athoroughly gripping tale. But what I loved most of all, underpinning the wholenarrative, is the moving way in which Dinah writes about the loss of childrenand the redemptive power of love.’About Dinah JefferiesDinahJefferies was born in Malaysia but moved to England at the age of nine,travelling widely throughout her life and always maintaining a love ofSoutheast Asia.

When Iwas seven I told a teacher that I was going to be a poet when I grew up, whichis odd because my poetry is terrible. My first book was written around the sametime. It was the story of Mr Noop, a teacher with a very long nose.Where do your ideas come from?I am always inspired by ‘whatif?’ My first novel – When We Were Sisters– was inspired by, what if my dad hadleft us when I was twelve (instead of what really happened, which was leavingwhen I was twenty-five!). The second novel, TheGood Neighbour, was inspired by reading about a woman who was fundraisingfor charity because her child was ill, and thinking, what if she’s lying? (I’m afraid that my what if’s aren’t alwaysvery nice.) And the novel I’m working on now is, what if it was possible to lead a double life when you got boredwith your first one…Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?As befits a first novel, mine wasvery influenced by my own experiences. For instance, like Miffy in the story, Idid have a batmitzvah when I wasthirteen (though she had a much nicer dress), and some of the characters inthat book are amalgams of real people. I also lived in North Wales for a fewyears, which features in the story. But the second novel is much morefictional. I think the only autobiographical aspect is that both the maincharacter and I are very short-sighted.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Plain prose which is vaguelyamusing. Lots of dialogue.Do you have any strange writing habits?I wish I had something exotic to tellyou, such as I can only write while wearing a silk dressing gown that belongedto Mae West; or I eat a grape every time I type a semi-colon (that’s anothergrape right there). But there’s nothing, really. The only apparently odd thingI do is keep everything in separate chapters, which I’ve been told is unusual(in fact the word the person used was ‘amateurish’! I love that people haveopinions about this stuff).Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads youMy first book I just wrote,having no idea of the story or where I was heading. Or even that I needed tohave a story, or know where I was heading. Writing time: approx. 12 years.I plotted the second book inadvance, possibly as a reaction to that 12 year thing. Writing time, 8 months.So that’s one nil to plotting.I plot loosely, and things do change on the way. But I do need some kind of planto work with, otherwise it just takes me so long to finish.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?First draft, without a doubt. It’slike pulling teeth. I love rewriting and will happily rewrite many times, butI’m not a fan of the blank page. I’m never happier than when I have a bigbundle of pages to edit, and a pen in my hand to make the story better.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Who says no to the first part ofthis question?! My favourites, in alphabeticalorder, are: Douglas Adams, Jane Austen, Judy Blume, Laurie Colwin, MonicaDickens, Nora Ephron, Margaret Forster, William Goldman, Howard Jacobson, DavidLodge, John O’Farrell, Anne Tyler, Molly Weir and PG Wodehouse.I’m a member of a group ofauthors called ‘Prime Writers.’ The thing we have in common is that we allpublished our first books when we were over the age of forty. Anyway, I’m currentlyworking my way through their books and have read some cracking ones amongstthem. I don’t want to single anyone out, but if you’re looking for some greatnew books to try, you can see what we’ve written on our website(theprimewriters.com)You are currently working on a non-fiction book, For the Love of The Archers: An Unofficial Companion, which is being published in October 2015. What prompted you to write this 'facts and trivia' book?A writer friend of mine gave the publishermy name and they asked me to do it. It seemed to me to be a dream commission. Ialready blogged about The Archers forpauseliveaction; like most fans of the programme, I hate it almost as much as Ilove it, but hating it is part of the fun. Doing the book made a nice changefrom writing fiction. Of course some people will tell you that The Archers is also fictional, but theywould be wrong.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?The Completer-Finisher’sHandbook. Subtitled: Being Too Pig-Headed To Ever Throw In the Towel.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Be too pig-headed to ever throwin the towel. Seriously, just keep on going with the writing. My secret beliefis that I only got published out of sheer bloody-minded persistence. If yougive up writing after a few rejections, you’ll never know the end of the story. Just about every published writer’sstory goes like this: ‘I wrote for years an got loads of rejections and keptgoing and then finally…’I run a course for writers called‘Dust Yourself Off’ which points out the huge number of famous writers who weremultiply-rejected before success. Rejections are an essential part of thewriting process, and you’re not nobody till you’ve got some.And lastly, why should people read The Good Neighbour?Ooh it’s a cracking good read.(My publisher told me to say that.) I think it’s an interesting story, abouttrust and friendship and betrayal. And it’s better plotted than the first one!About Beth MillerBeth Miller’s first novel, When We Were Sisters, was recently published by Ebury (Random). Hersecond novel, The Good Neighbour,will be published in September 2015.

But is the third victim that ensures the presence of detectiveMaeve Kerrigan and the murder squad. It appears that controversial MP GeoffArmstrong, trapped by the fire, chose to jump to his death rather than wait forrescue. But what was such a right wing politician doing in the deprived,culturally diverse Maudling Estate?As Maeveand her senior colleague, Derwent, pick through the wreckage, they uncover thesecret world of the 11th floor, where everyone seems to have something to hide…My verdictI read After The Fire as a standalone, so I knew nothing about the characters before I started reading. It's clear that I've missed a lot of background, but this didn't detract from the main storyline. It has just left me intrigued and wanting to read the previous books.The plot is an intriguing one. A fire in a tower block leaves three people dead. Many of the 11th floor residents are hiding secrets - they could have been the targets or the perpetrators. Detective Maeve Kerrigan is on the case to discover the truth.The author has created realistic believable characters, with personalities that really shine through, jumping out of the pages as I read. The writing in this police procedural is fast paced and upbeat, filled with humour. One particular scene had me in stitches - just brilliant.I enjoyed every minute of After The Fire and look forward to reading more books in this series.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Alison Baillie - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Thursday 3 September 2015", "text": "I am delighted that ALISON BAILLIE is joining me on my blog today for her blog tour. Alison's book - Sewing the Shadows Together - was published by Matador on 7 August 2015. What inspired you tobecome a writer? I’ve always liked writing. When I was about eight or nine Iused to make little books and comics at home, and at school I can rememberbeing told by the teacher to stop writing such long stories; I got carried awaywith thrilling topics like A Day in the Life of a Penny. I’d always thought Iwanted to write a book, but with jobs, family, divorce and changing countries Inever had time until my sons left home. Where did you get theidea for Sewing the Shadows Together? In the seventies and eighties I taught English in Edinburghsecondary schools. At this time there were several high-profile murders in thearea and even after the cases were closed I couldn’t stop thinking about thepeople who were left behind – how could they ever get over something like that?I also became very interested in miscarriages of justice and cold case reviewsand gradually the story that had been in my mind for so long began to solidifyand take shape.Describe your writingstyle in 10 words or less?Readable, strong on character and settingDo you have anystrange writing habits? I’m very bad at getting started – I am the archetypal ‘haveto get all my pencils sharpened before I begin’ type – but once I start I can’tstop. I’ve found that I write best in places where there is no internet - becauseI can waste an awful lot of time on that.Are you a plotter ora pantser? Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just startwriting and see where it leads you? Because Sewing the Shadows had been forming in my mind forso long I had a very clear idea of the plot before I started, although I’dnever written anything down. When I eventually began to write, the words flowedquickly and the plot seemed to spring to life fully-formed. Having said that,as I wrote further the story took on a life of its own: characters developeddifferently, some scenes were dropped and even the identity of the murdererchanged. I read something in Stephen King’s On Writing where he said that writingis like uncovering a skeleton buried in the sand; as you brush away more of thesand the story is revealed. I could identify very strongly with that. What do you considerto be the hardest part of your writing? Definitely getting started. My first story was in my headfor almost thirty years before I began writing it. The idea for my second novelis very developed in my mind, but I’m finding it difficult to find my way intoit.How did you go aboutresearching the background for your novel? The novel is set in places that I know well, Portobello,Edinburgh, the Outer Hebrides and Plettenberg Bay in South Africa. I changedsome aspects of the geography and institutions deliberately, and I didn’t checkevery detail in the locations, because I wanted it to be true to the atmosphereof the places, rather than finding out whether a street was one-way or not. Who are yourfavourite authors? I read a great deal, especially Scottish and Scandi Crime.One of my sons looked up Tartan Noir in Wikipedia and it reads like a list ofmy favourite authors. It seems invidious to pick out individuals, but if I hadto pick four I’d say Ian Rankin, Stuart McBride, Lin Anderson and YrsaSigurdardottir.How has your lifechanged since becoming a published author? It’s really too soon to answer that because my first novelhas only just been published. However, there is a difference: before if peopleasked me if I wrote I used to mumble something a little self-consciously andnow I can say that I am a writer. That’s an incredibly good feeling.If you were writing abook about your life, what would the title be? I once read a quotation from George Eliot ‘Haunts of EchoesOld and Far’. and I thought then it would make a good title for a book. Maybe Icould use it for my life-story (not that I’m thinking of writing it!)What advice do youhave for aspiring writers? I think the best advice is definitely to read as much aspossible, and try and work out what makes a particular novel great. I oftenread novels I love more than once – the first time for the story and the secondtime to see how characters are introduced, how clues are buried and how theplot is developed.And lastly, whyshould people read Sewing the Shadows Together? I hope that readers will be drawn into the world of Sarahand Tom, and identify with them as they are caught up in a web of death,secrets, deception and love, before the truth finally comes to light.About Alison BaillieAlisonBaillie was brought up in Yorkshire by Scottish parents.

When her best friend Sarah meets Shona's brother Tom again after all these years, it brings back memories of that horrific time in their lives. Then the police reveal that the case has been reopened, as the man convicted for the crime has been cleared by DNA evidence. So the question is - who did kill Shona all those years ago?Alison Baillie has a very vivid way of writing, and I found myself fully immersed in her characters' lives. There are many different suspects, from family members to friends and teachers. DNA testing can reveal the killer, but only if the police find the right person to test. Meanwhile Sarah's family life begins to fall apart as secrets are revealed and revelations come to light. And Tom is learning where he belongs after drifting through life for years since his sister was murdered.This is a brilliant tightly-plotted debut. It's not a police procedural, but rather a thriller with many twists and turns to lead the reader off track. It's thought-provoking and will keep you guessing until the end.I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review."},

But life in Ceylon is not what Gwen expected. The plantation workers are resentful, the neighbours treacherous. And there are clues to the past - a dusty trunk of dresses, an overgrown gravestone in the grounds - that her husband refuses to discuss. Just as Gwen finds her feet, disaster strikes. She faces a terrible choice, hiding the truth from almost everyone, but a secret this big can't stay buried forever . . .My verdictIn The Tea Planter's Wife, I was well and truly transported back to 1920s Ceylon. The sights, sounds and aromas all came alive in this well-written emotional and tragic story.Newly-wed Gwen travels to Ceylon to join her husband Laurence on his tea plantation. She is ill-prepared for her new life, with little knowledge of this exotic country's people and culture. While her husband works hard to build up and expand his business, Gwen is left much to her own devices. She takes over the running of the household but struggles to cope with her husband's sister Verity, a difficult and spiteful young woman with no plans to make a life of her own.Laurence's first wife and baby son died several years earlier under suspicious circumstances, and no one talks about the past. When Gwen falls pregnant, tragedy strikes, leading to secrets and decisions that haunt and torment Gwen over the years.When I started reading The Tea Planter's Wife, I was expecting a straightforward saga with a few family secrets. But this book is so much more than this. It's a story of jealousy, greed, love, exploration and tragedy. I wasn't prepared for the revelations at the end; under different circumstances, the story could have been so different. This was a lovely read and the story stayed in my mind for some time afterwards.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley and through the Lovereading Reviewer Panel in exchange for an honest review."},

But on their arrival in Perth, the southern sun shines aharsh light on both Henry and Charlotte and slowly reveals that their new lifeis not the answer either was hoping for. Charlotte is left wondering if thereis anywhere she belongs, and how far she'll go to find her way home...My verdictThe Other Side of the World is a story about finding your place in the world - what happens when you feel like you don't belong and what makes a place into a home.This is a beautiful story, written with great tenderness. It takes you from England to Australia and India, showing the contrast between these locations in the 1960s. The vivid descriptions of each country tackle all of your senses - the sights, the aromas and the sounds all seeming very real.Charlotte was an artist before she had children, but, exhausted and lonely, she is now struggling to cope with motherhood. Her academic husband Henry, who was born in India, doesn't feel comfortable in the cold damp English winters. So when an opportunity arises to move to Australia, he jumps at the chance. Although Charlotte is reluctant to give up her home, she gives in for an easy life, hoping that the move to Australia will lift her out of her current state of mind. But they both discover that the grass isn't always greener...The Other Side of the World is a highly compelling story that makes you think. It's very sad and emotional. It moves along slowly but steadily, revealing each character's emotions and inner thoughts. Charlotte is on the edge of a breakdown, taking it out on her family, desperate to find something more in life. Henry is so self-absorbed at times, contemplating what it means to be British, that he doesn't see how much his marriage is in crisis.

Played out against a gritty landscapeon the edge of a Northern town, Karen and Sean risk losing all they holdprecious.My verdictTo Catch A Rabbit is an enjoyable crime debut with a complex plot and lots of well-developed characters.Sean Denton is an interesting protagonist - he's a community support officer rather than a police officer.  He's good at watching people and certainly knows his patch, so notices when something isn't right. And he's not afraid to investigate, even though he isn't qualified to do so.The story follows two seemingly unrelated subplots - the discovery of a dead prostitute and a man's disappearance. As the story progresses, it's clear that the crimes are linked, but Sean has to put the clues together to discover how. There's a great build up to the final showdown, as all the characters and subplots come together.To Catch A Rabbit has some great twists and turns.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Steve McHugh", "date": "Thursday 27 August 2015", "text": "I am delighted that STEVE MCHUGH is joining me on my blog today. Steve's latest book in his Hellequin Chronicles series - Lies Ripped Open - was published on 25 August 2015. What inspired you to writea book in the first place?My wife and three daughters mostly. They inspire me to writepretty much all the time. I’m constantly wanting to better myself, to be thebest writer I can be because my wife reads my books and if it’s not goodenough, she will tell me. On a more specific thought, I wanted to write Lies RippedOpen since the first word of Crimes Against Magic. LRO has a lot of answersabout Nate, his friends, his enemies, and the world he lives in. It has a lotof questions too, and I’m looking forward to building on what’s gone so far.Describe your writingstyle in 10 words or less?That might be the hardest question I’ve ever been asked.I’ll give a go. Fun, energetic, easy to read, non-flowery.Yeah, that’ll do. Do you have anystrange writing habits?I’ve been asked this before, and I don’t. Rather, I don’tthink I do. I should get myself a strange habit. But if I do that, it’llprobably end up causing the OCD part of my brain to freak out. Are you a plotter ora pantser? Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just startwriting and see where it leads you?Bit of both. I wrote Crimes Against Magic as a completepantser and I’ll never do that again as it was insane and took three to fouryears to write. I tend to have the plot worked out. Beginning and end areall known. I know the main characters plots and where things should be going,but I leave the actual chapter contents up to whatever happens to come out whenI actually start writing. It’s nice to be surprised. When you wrote Crimes Against Magic (The HellequinChronicles 1), did you plan that it would be the start of a series?Yes. It was always going to be the first book in a series.Originally it was going to be a dozen books, but it’s expanded somewhat.Your books include alot of world mythology – how much research do you do before you start writing?There’s quite a bit of research into mythological beings,and then more to try and twist them into something usable, something peoplemight not expect. More research is done on the flashback parts. I don’t tendto write the dialog as they would have spoken back in the day (because theswitch from past to present would be a massive shock), but I do like to havethe technology, and the like, the descriptive parts of the flashbacks correct.I like research, so it’s all good. What’s the best partof creating a completely fictional world with mythical and fantasy creatures?I get to do crazy stuff with them. I want Nate to fight aJapanese spider-monster, I can do that. I want Hades to be a badass, I can dothat too! Basically I created a world, which while based on our world, has allof this insanity in it. It’s fun to play with. Who are yourfavourite authors?This could turn into quite the list, so you might want toget comfortable:Terry Pratchett, Robin Hobb, Jim Butcher, Kelley Armstrong,John Connolly, Warren Ellis, Grant Morrison, Kurtis Wiebe, Ray Bradbury, JenWilliams, and far too many more to write without just making this a massivelist. If you were writing abook about your life, what would the title be?Well That Was Unexpected.What advice do youhave for aspiring writers?Don’t try to write a bestseller, or try to write a book youthink people want to read. Write a book you want to read. Everything else willfall into place, but if you’re not invested 1000% no one else will be.And lastly, whyshould people read your Hellequin Chronicles series? They should read it because I really enjoy writing them,because I think other people will like them too, and because they have a 1600year old sorcerer who kicks ass and doesn’t exactly behave like a typical whitehat wearing good-guy. But above all, because they’re fun and exciting, and wecould all use a little fun and excitement in our reading.About Steve McHughSteve McHugh is the author ofthe popular Hellequin Chronicles.

For one night with her, he’ll pay enough tobring her back from the edge.Roz has achoice to make.My verdictI literally couldn't put this book down. The Mistake I Made is written in such a clever way that I just had to read another page, then another and another and so on. The words seep under your skin, as the plot builds and builds. I was savouring every word.Roz is desperate for money to keep a roof over her and her young son's head. Her ex-husband is useless, providing little in the way of childcare, let alone financial help. So when a stranger offers her a way out, it doesn't take much for her to agree to his suggestion. But not surprisingly, everything goes horribly wrong.Not only was the plot a fascinating one, but I enjoyed reading the background too - the setting of the Lake District and also the physiotherapy details.

Nearly twenty years later, Lois has become aprofessor, teaching British literature at a small college in upstate New York,and Carly May is an actress in Los Angeles, drinking too much and struggling torevive her career. When a movie with a shockingly familiar plot draws the twowomen together once more, they must face the public exposure of their secrethistory and confront the dark longings and unspeakable truths that haunt themstill.My verdictPretty Is is a well written original debut, with beautiful flowing narrative.Two women were kidnapped together when they were 12. One was a pageant queen, the other a spelling bee champion. Now adults, both remain brilliant and beautiful yet psychologically damaged from the abduction.Rather than a thriller, as indicated by the blurb, this is more of a study into the psychology of abduction and how the two girls managed to move on with their lives. Most of the book is set decades after the abduction, looking at its emotional impact and the women's relationships with friends, family and colleagues. There's a stalking subplot going on too, which creates suspense and tension.While I love the writing style and underlying story, I did feel somewhat dissatisfied, as if something was missing. The kidnapper never touched the two girls in an appropriate manner. But he didn't live to give his side of the story. You can only guess what his motives were. There were many key questions that remained unanswered, which could be a letdown for a lot of readers. Yet I loved the writing style and underlying story, which kept me reading until the end.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

But I discovered that Stirred With Love provided a lovely relaxing break from all the crime/thrillers I usually read.The story flows well, with snappy dialogue and a fast-paced plot. It focuses on three very different women, Lily, Kate and Chloe, all of whom have life-changing decisions to make. Kate and Chloe are brought together by Lily, who wants to reopen her café as a coffee shop.As expected with chick lit novels, there are disasters, romances and adventures along the way. The book is warm and humorous and a lovely holiday read.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

When I wasresearching A Cornish Stranger I rented Powders, a National Trust cottage, setat the mouth of Frenchman’s Creek. The cottage faces west and was baked in theautumnal sun all day long.  The water’sof Frenchman’s Creek were warm and I regretted that I didn’t have our kayak toprovide me the freedom to explore the creek and inlets all along the Helfordwith only the birds disturbing the stillness. I yearned to have my husband withme so that we could picnic on the hidden beaches and enjoy the beauty together.I would also set off for the north coastand wander along the empty beaches and finish my day in St Ives at PortminsterBeach Café with its wonderful calamari to start and maybe finish with itsmonkfish curry. Of course in October there is no problem getting a table at thebusy restaurants – even the best tables with the views that are somehow better withthe lower angle of the sunlight.The many pubs feel cozier and wrap you intheir warmth with the darkness complete outside and the fire roaring within.Somehow Cornwall uniqueness tucked on the end of Britain is easier toexperience when the crowds have gone and the whistling wind is the mostprevalent sound.Under a Cornish SkyBy Liz FenwickPublished by Orion (7 May 2015)Publisher's descriptionDemi desperately needs her luck to change.On the sleeper train down to Cornwall, she can't help wondering why everythingalways goes wrong for her.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT (and book extract) - Virgina Macgregor - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Thursday 20 August 2015", "text": "I am delighted that VIRGINIA MACGREGOR is joining me on my blog today for her What Milo Saw Blog Tour. Virginia's book - What Milo Saw - was published by Little Brown on 13 August 2015. After the interview, scroll down to read an extract from What Milo Saw.So Virginia, what inspired you tobecome a writer?I was read to from a young age and grew up in a family thatwas forever telling stories – creating my own tales and putting them on paperwas the natural next step and when I heard that being a writer was a properjob, well, my fate was sealed.  Where did you get theidea for What Milo Saw?I’d been wanting to write about the way in which we care (orfail to care) for older people in the UK for a long time but it was only when Icreated Milo that I knew I had a character who could carry that story withsensitivity, love and humour. Describe your writingstyle in 10 words or less?Funny. Quirky. Warm. Moving. Unexpected. Contemporary. Do you have anystrange writing habits?I have a few objects on my desk that inspire me: a blank,white photo frame that I look to when I need an idea; a jar of stones whichreminds me to prioritise (see my blog post on this); a small candle that Ilight before I start writing; lots of pictures, for example of the animals inmy stories (pigs, dogs, foxes, goats…). I even have a croched Hamlet that anamazing crochet artist made for me! I love to surround myself with things fromthe world of my novels.Are you a plotter ora pantser? Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just startwriting and see where it leads you?I know what my opening scene is, that’s very important. Ihave some idea of the closing scene and then I plan as I go: I do a colourfulmindmap for each scene that I’m about to write and more mindmaps of characters,locations etc. So, a bit of both.What led you to focuson retinitis pigmentosa in What Milo Saw – and how did you research the impactof this condition?When I created Milo, I knew that, simply by virtue of hischaracter, he would have a very particular view on the world. At the same time,I wanted to explore the issue of how children with disabilities of any kind(physical, emotional, social) have the most amazing capacity to compensate andsometimes achieve incredible things. I’m very short-sighted so I’ve alwaysgiven a lot of thought to sight and how hard it must be for people who havevisual impairments. When I talked to my optician about this she told me about alittle boy she cared for who has RP. From that moment, I did all the research Icould: I read books, I joined forums, I got in touch with charities like BlindChildren UK, the RNIB and RP Fighting Blindness. I was also moved by the newsstory of six-year-old Molly Bent who created a bucket list of the things shewanted to see before she went blind. How easy was it towrite from the point of view of a child? And has Milo turned out to be evenmore adorable than you originally planned?Milo’s voice came very naturally. Writers often say that thechild part of them is still very much alive and I think that’s true of me.Being a teacher has also helped as I get to see the world through the eyes ofyoung people. Capturing his voice and so the voice of a child came through theprocess of writing: the more I wrote in Milo’s voice, the closer I felt to him.Within a few chapters, it felt like he’d jumped off the page and startedwalking around in the real world. It has given me so much joy to see howreaders have fallen in love with Milo in the same way that I have. Who are yourfavourite authors?So, so many (and the list is growing all the time). Here area few: Anne Tyler, Carol Shield, Jon Mcgregor, Barbara Kingsolver, JodiPicoult, Charles Dickens, Jonathan Safron-Foer, Richard Ford, Sue Townsend, MichaelOndaatje, Roald Dahl, Nick Hornby.How has your lifechanged since becoming a published author?It has changed hugely. It feels as though I have been givenpermission to do what matters most to me in the world. There’s no greater giftthan that. If you were writing abook about your life, what would the title be?‘Dancing in the Rain’.I love the rain and I love the idea of being positive and energetic no matterwhat the weather (literally and metaphorically). Oh, and my husband makes funof my dancing – apparently I have no rhythm, so the title is ironic too.What advice do youhave for aspiring writers?Write every day. Write what you love to read.Never give up.And lastly, whyshould people read What Milo Saw? Milo is a book that touches our lives on so many levels:there is something for every kind of reader. It explores the complex nature ofhuman relationships from the love of a little boy and his Gran to the strugglesof a single mum abandoned by her husband; it tackles some of the biggest socialissues of our age: immigration, the crisis in nursing homes, children livingwith disabilities; it is quirky and funny but also very sad at times. Aboveall, it tells a gripping story of a remarkable little boy who helps us see theworld a little differently.Here's an extract from What Milo Saw, a gorgeous heartwarming book:Milo sat at the computer on the landing listening to the shush-shushing of the firemen’s hose on the drive. The firemen had only just let them back into the house.‘I want a list of nursing homes,’ said Mum.‘Can’t Gran stay till Christmas?’Gran was Dad’s gran and Milo’s great-gran but everyone just called her Gran.Milo turned his head to look at the fairy lights he’d wound round the banisters leading up to Gran’sroom. He’d had the idea when he saw her struggling to find the light switch.Mum guided Milo’s head back to look at her and said ‘No.’‘But . . . ’‘Don’t insist,’ said Mum and then pinched shut her mouth.Don’t insist was Mum’s favourite phrase of all time.‘But Mum – the fire was my fault, I should have gone down to check.’And it was true. Every morning when Gran padded down the stairs from her room under the roof all the way to the kitchen and made her cup of sweet, milky tea, it was Milo's job to make sure she was okay. He'd lie in bed and listen for clues:1. The clink of Gran’s tartan mug as she pulled it off the mug tree.2. The suck and pop of the jar with the tea bags.3. The rattle of the cutlery drawer as she took out her favourite teaspoon, the one made of real silverwith a kink in its handle.4. The kettle filling up (though usually Milo tried to remember to fill it up the night before becauseGran’s wrists were weak and she struggled to hold the weight of so much water).5. The click of the switch on the kettle.6. A pause.7. And then the water heating, steam pushing at the lid, bubbles rolling over each other like a hot sea, and then another click when it was done.8. Sometimes, after step 3, Gran forgot they had a kettle and she’d open the saucepan drawer and fill a pan up and light the stove. That was the cue for Milo to swing his legs out of bed and come downstairs.They had a gas hob and Gran wasn’t allowed to use it.Milo didn’t know why he missed the sound of the saucepan drawer that day. He must have beensleepy or maybe Gran was extra quiet, but by the time he felt the flutter in his chest which told himthat Gran needed him, and by the time Hamlet was squealing his head off in the garage because he’dswallowed too much smoke, it was too late, the kitchen was on fire.‘It’s not your responsibility to check on your gran,’ said Mum.She leant in and kissed Milo’s hair. She was always doing that: telling him off and then kissing him.She smelt of burnt things and sticky perfume and sleep.‘When all this is over, I’ll let Hamlet stay in the house,’ she said.Milo leant under the desk and gave Hamlet a rub between his ears. The only reason he was allowed up here now was because the fire had scared him.  Milo hated the fact that Hamlet had to live in the garage all by himself: the garage was cold and damp and didn’t have any windows. No one should live like that. But if Milo had to choose between Hamlet coming out of the garage or Gran getting to stay with them, he’d have to pick Gran. Hamlet would understand.Mum looked over Milo’s shoulder at the computer screen.‘We don’t want anywhere fancy, Milo, Gran wouldn’t like that.’So Milo tried typing not fancy nursing homes into Google but Google didn’t get it and wrote back: did you mean fancy nursing homes?Once Milo had stationed Gran safely on the drive and once he’d yanked open the main door to thegarage and got Hamlet out of his cage and given him to Gran to look after, he’d come back inside and screamed: Fire! Fire! Mum! There’s a fire!Mum had come tearing down the stairs and out of the house, her non-make-up face all pale and puffy. When she saw Gran she didn’t ask how she was and she didn’t say she was relieved that Hamlet was safely out of the garage and she didn’t tell Milo well done for having saved everyone. She just yelled the same words over and over:This is the last straw. This is the last bloody straw.Milo and Gran both knew what the last bloody straw meant: it meant that Gran was going to a nursing home.Mum jabbed a chipped pink nail at the computer screen.‘Those rooms are far too big,’ she said. ‘Gran will feel lost.’So Milo did a search for nursing homes with small rooms. But then he thought about all the stuffGran had upstairs, like Great-Gramps’s bagpipes and his uniform and the boxes of letters he’d written her and her map of Inverary and the picture of her fishing boat and her small radio and how she’d want to take it all with her.‘It’s not coming up with anything.’ If Milo made Mum feel it was a hassle, maybe she’d back down.‘Oh, for goodness sake, Milo.’ Mum looked up the stairs to Gran’s room and scratched a red bit onher throat. Then she leant in and whispered, ‘Just find somewhere cheap.’Mum wrote the word CHEAP on the back of an envelope and placed it right in front of Milo so itwasn’t lost in the fuzzy bit of his vision. He ran his fingers over the word; she’d pressed so hard onthe pencil that the letters felt bumpy.‘I’ve got to make the firemen some tea.’Still in her nightie (the frilly one that looked like the kitchen curtains, or how they looked before theycaught fire and turned into black moths on the linoleum floor), Mum rushed back downstairs. Miloheard the cupboard door open and the rustle of the Hobnobs packet. The plastic kettle had melted, so Milo didn't know how Mum was going to boil water for the tea.Milo wasn’t going to let Mum stick Gran in a nursing home. He’d pretend to go along with it andthen Mum would calm down and realise that Gran belonged right here in the small room Dad hadconverted for her under the roof, and that Milo was the best person to look after her. Then they’d have a proper Christmas, the four of them: Milo, Gran, Hamlet and Mum.Milo scanned down the list of homes on the screen. They all had garden centre names like Acorn Cottage and Birdgrove and Beechcroft Hill and Bird Poo View. He made up the last one.Milo typed: not cheap nursing homes into Google and waited for a new page to load.‘Found anything yet?’ Mum called up the stairs.The burnt smell had crept into the carpet and curtains and walls and was making the back of Milo’s throat tickle.He coughed and called back: ‘Nearly!’‘Well, when you have, give me the phone numbers and I’ll organise some visits.’Milo didn’t answer.Above him, the floorboards creaked and then water juddered through the pipes. He hoped Gran would remember to turn off the tap. As soon as he’d finished making this stupid list, he’d go up and tell Gran that there was no way he was going to let Mum kick her out. He’d work out a plan that guaranteed she could stay, and not just for Christmas.About Virginia MacgregorVirginia Macgregor hada nomadic early childhood, moving between Germany, America, Corsica and Oxford,where she finally settled at the age of four.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Sarah Vaughan - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Wednesday 19 August 2015", "text": "I am delighted that SARAH VAUGHAN is joining me on my blog today as part of her Blog Tour. Sarah's book - The Art of Baking Blind - was published in paperback on 13 August 2015. What inspired you to writea novel?I’ve always wanted to write. I read English at Oxford but it neverreally occurred to me that I could write fiction, or at least not the sort I’dbeen studying. (The most modern was Virginia Woolf’s and TS Eliot’s; themajority written by dead white men.) I thought I could write, though, and sotrained to become a journalist. I joined the Press Association as a news traineeand was poached by The Guardian where I worked as a news reporter, healthcorrespondent and political correspondent for eleven varied, interesting years.Like many hacks, I itched to write a novel but I didn’t havethe confidence to get started: I didn’t feel I had anything sufficientlyinteresting to say. That changed with motherhood. I took voluntary redundancyafter my second child to freelance, and as I did creative things with mychildren – including baking – I found my voice. There was plenty I could writeabout: nurture; motherhood; the demands women place on themselves and the gulfbetween their needs and roles as wives and mothers; the disparity betweenappearance and reality; the impossibility of perfection. Once I had a hook, allthese preoccupations could be articulated.What gave you theidea for The Art of Baking Blind?The idea for The Art of Baking Blind cameas I baked with my children and watched other mothers – and it was alwaysmothers – bake for school cake sales. I realised I was over-investing my bakingwith emotion: if I baked with my kids it meant I was a good mother; I wasnurturing them and showing how much they were loved. At the same time, I caughtthe final episode of a series called The Great British Bake Off. It was autumn2011 and the finalist who would win, Jo Wheatley, explained she had entered“because I wanted to do something for myself.” It then transpired that herhusband was in prison for his part in a £60m fraud. I’ve always been fascinatedby people’s “back stories” – the events that make us who we are - and here wasan incredible one! But why else would people push themselves to compete in abaking competition? I thought of the bakers I’d known since childhood and threecharacters – Vicki, Karen and Jenny – quickly emerged. Do your personal experiencesinfluence your writing? If so, how?I don’t think it’s possible to avoidthat, particularly with a first novel although I was very concerned that Ididn’t exploit other members of my family. Many of the characters have elementsof my personality in them. For instance, I’m a bit of a perfectionist likeVicki, and my children mean everything to me like Jenny. I’ve never had Karen’scomplex relationship with food but from the one time I’ve dieted – before mywedding – I could see how easily one could become fixated with calorie countingand slimming. Similarly, although I’ve never experienced Kathleen’s problem, Idid have huge trouble conceiving my first baby and know what it’s like tobecome obsessed with having a child and with fearing that it will never be apossibility.Describe your writingstyle in 10 words or less?I hate talking about myself – yes really – so I’mgoing to quote my editor, who likens it to a lemon drizzle cake: “rich yetmoreish with just the right amount of bite”. She also describes mine as: “Warm,compassionate, inventive writing; sophisticated yet accessible; with unflinchingemotional honesty.” Do you have anystrange writing habits?I have to drink caffeine before I start writing. AnEarl Grey to ease me in, then a double shot Lavazza coffee. Since I work whenmy kids are at school I tend to have walked a brisk mile and a half taking themthere, ideally more. I’m afraid I don’t do anything unconventional. If I’mstruggling with something I’ll go to a different setting – the library orgarden – and write in longhand. But most of the time it’s just me, clatteringaway at my desk.Do you plot out thewhole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?AmI a plotter or a pantster? More of the former though my characters take on alife of their own and I’m constantly re-plotting.I’ve written two novels now and with both I’ve thought a lotabout the plot before the start: I’ve known the crucial scenes and how it willend. But both, particularly the second, have required a lot of redrafting andrearranging or cutting of chapters, and have changed vastly in the writing. With The Art of Baking Blind, I knew from the start that itwould be structured around six stages of a baking competitionthat would provide natural peaks and, I hoped, some compulsion to continuereading. (Although, who wins the competition doesn’t really matter; like allnovels it’s about the characters’ process of self-realisation.)At 28,000 words I plotted each chapter and althoughthere were extraneous characters that were later cut, and a couple of extraplot lines that came in, this helped me weave them all together. I then slottedin the Kathleen flashbacks – which are discrete from the present-day plot – atstrategic points. At one point, after the first draft, I drew up a huge grid,with the chapters along the top and the characters, including Kathleen, downthe left hand side. I then pinpointed what each character was doing in eachchapter so that I could get a sense of whether their stories were balanced inimportance, and to check that they weren’t vying for attention all the time. What do you considerto be the hardest part of your writing?My second novel, That Summer atSkylark Farm, which I’m just finishing, has involved some major redrafting.It’s a hugely improved novel but I did feel a pang having to cut quite so many thousandsof words. There’s also the sense of isolation, having come from a buzzingnewspaper office, particularly when I worked in the lobby. And the self-doubt.Do you think thatyour journalistic background has benefited you as a fiction author?Undoubtedly. When I first wrote to my agent, Lizzy Kremer, I playedup being a journalist. I could meet deadlines and write to length, I said, andhad written every day of my career. The implication was that of course Icould write a novel. And yet writing a 600-800 word news story based onresearch, and with the safety net of other people’s knowledge and quotations toback you up is very different to concocting 100,000 words, and creating such apsychologically-plausible, immersive, compelling world that you manage not onlyto capture but retain your reader’s attention. Having said that, having spent my entire adult life asa journalist I know how to meet deadlines; to write to a daily word count; tocut the waffle (I hope); and to spot a good hook or twist. I find fictionharder, because of the need to retain the reader’s attention for quite so long,but far more challenging and exciting.How has your lifechanged since getting your publishing deal?Well it’s been betterfinancially. But it’s also been fantastic for my sense of self-belief. I foundit difficult taking redundancy from the Guardian, which I did because we’dmoved and I’d had a problematic second pregnancy. But I hadn’t realised howmuch of my identity was bound up in being published and with writing constantly.The Art of Baking Blind puts paid to all of that. It’s been the most wonderfulexperience and I still can’t believe how lucky I’ve been to secure this dealand to actually have my novel in bookshops! I’ve even started calling myself anauthor (albeit with an apologetic, disbelieving smile.)I have to ask – areyou good at baking? And what’s your favourite type of cake?I think I amgood at baking. Many of my favourite cakes didn’t make it into the novel asthey weren’t sufficiently complex or metaphorically rich. These include my veryfavourite, Devil’s Food Cake, which is the cake my mum used to make for ourbirthdays and I now make for my kids. It’s so delicious that I shared it on theWaterstone’s blog: https://www.waterstones.com/blog/recipe-devils-food-cakeIf you were writing abook about your life, what would the title be?That’s an impossiblequestion. I tend to be quite self-deprecating but I could hardly publish anautobiography entitled: I’m really sorry. It’s a cheat but maybe 'A Room of MyOwn'? At the moment, I work alongside my son’s Lego and my daughter’s piano andI’ve been thinking a lot about Woolf’s suggestion. Though I think I’m quitesociable, writing is a solitary business and quite a selfish one.  To write well, I need that space.What advice do youhave for aspiring writers?Read, widely and critically, then plant yourseat on a chair and get started. Take your writing seriously because if youdon’t nobody will. Be disciplined: develop that splinter of ice in the heartthat Graham Greene said all writers should have and don’t allow yourself to bedistracted. Persist. Push yourself to get better. Cling on to your self-belief.And lastly, whyshould people read The Art of Baking Blind?The Art of Baking Blind is a novel about why we bake but it’s also aboutmotherhood, nurture, the importance of being loved, the pressures women put onthemselves and the impossibility of perfection. It’s about a baking competitioninspired by a 1960s recipe book by an early domestic goddess, Kathleen Eaden. Herstrictures imply that you can have the perfect family life if you bakeexquisite cakes, biscuits and bread. But as the novel progresses, we see thecontestants’ lives unravel and we realise, through a series of flashbacks, thatKathleen’s life was, inevitably, not perfect. I hope it will appeal not just tobakers, or to people who enjoy sensuous food writing, but readers who relate toengaging, complex characters and who want a little darkness, as well as warmth,in a read.About Sarah VaughanSarah Vaughan read English at Oxford and went on to become a journalist. After 11 years at the Guardian as a news reporter, health correspondent and political correspondent, she started freelancing.

But often we bake to fill a hunger that would be better filled by a simple gesture from a dear one. We bake to love and be loved.In 1966, Kathleen Eaden, cookery writer and wife of a supermarket magnate, published The Art of Baking, her guide to nurturing a family by creating the most exquisite pastries, biscuits and cakes.Now, five amateur bakers are competing to become the New Mrs Eaden. There's Jenny, facing an empty nest now her family has flown; Claire, who has sacrificed her dreams for her daughter; Mike, trying to parent his two kids after his wife's death; Vicki, who has dropped everything to be at home with her baby boy; and Karen, perfect Karen, who knows what it's like to have nothing and is determined her façade shouldn't slip.As unlikely alliances are forged and secrets rise to the surface, making the choicest choux bun seems the least of the contestants' problems.

Its gorgeous description of a gingerbread house tackled all of my senses. I could not only picture the gingerbread house, but I could feel it, smell it and taste it too.This book is a fictional version of the Great British Bake Off with all the same excitement, sob stories and heartache behind the scenes. The characters are well-developed, each with their own reason for entering the competition to find the new Mrs Eaden. I had no idea who was going to win, as each character (except maybe one) was a worthy contender.The story also follows the original Mrs Eaden, Kathleen, a cookery writer who appeared to live the perfect life. But as the book unravels, it's clear that not everything was so perfect behind the scenes.While reading The Art of Baking Blind, I could savour the taste and aromas of the baking. This is a deliciously sweet book to be savoured, enjoying each and every word, reading slowly rather than in fast chunks.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just startwriting and see where it leads you?I am a pantser.  Idon’t like to outline my books before I begin, or even think through them toomuch; I find that overthinking the novel takes away from the natural flow.  Instead, I dive right in and develop mycharacters and see where they lead me.What do you considerto be the hardest part of your writing?Getting started.  Eventhough I may have an idea I’m excited about, the characters are brand new to meand I don’t know them yet.  It takes timeto develop that relationship between author and character before I have a senseof who they are and what their motivations may be.  Once I’ve had a chance to develop thecharacters the writing becomes more free flowing and less forced.In your latest novel,Pretty Baby, the story is narrated by Heidi, her husband Chris and a girlcalled Willow. How easy is to write a novel with multiple points of view?I personally find that it’s easier to write a novel frommultiple points of view rather than just one. Though it takes time to develop each of their distinct voices, there aremany stories that can be told through the use of multiple narrators, and thereader is left with a well-rounded image of the tale rather than just onenarrator’s perspective.  Who are yourfavourite authors?Ann Hood, Heather Gudenkauf, Anita Shreve, Jodi Picoult, PamJenoffHow has your lifechanged since becoming a published author?Writing has become a career rather than a hobby, and it’ssomething I get to devote time everyday to doing, rather that simply when Ihave the time.  That’s the biggestchange.  I love that this is a career Ican do from home, and so I get to spend nearly as much time with my kids as Ialways have.  I am much busier, ofcourse, between writing the books, some travel, and publicity, but I enjoy itimmensely.  If you were writing abook about your life, what would the title be?‘Take Two’What advice do youhave for aspiring writers?Never give up!  I’msure most everyone has heard the story now of how it took me two years to find anagent and so I don’t want to rehash it again, but my offer of representationcame at a time when I’d all but forgotten about The Good Girl completely, andif it wasn’t for one optimistic agent, my first novel never would have beenpublished.  Write everyday, and keepsending your manuscripts out to agents until you find the one who’s aspassionate about it as you!And lastly, whyshould people read Pretty Baby? Pretty Baby is a suspense tale, and yet it’s more than that,too.  The novel takes a look at societalissues such as homelessness and the foster care system, as well as familydynamics and marital discord.  It’s onethat will hopefully have readers on the edge of their seat, and yet tug attheir heartstrings, too.  About Mary KubicaMary Kubica holds a Bachelor or Arts degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in History and American Literature.

Now Heidi must question if her motives for helping the stranger areunselfish or rooted in her own failures.My verdictPretty Baby is a brilliant book and I recommend it to all psychological thriller fans.I couldn't put it down, racing from beginning to end. It's a beautifully written story with detailed vivid descriptions and well-developed characters. Mary Kubica includes the tiniest details that make everything seem so real, whether it's the setting or character's thoughts or mannerisms.Pretty Baby is an unsettling story, looking at what happened when Heidi let Willow, a homeless teenager (and her baby Ruby), into her home. Heidi and her husband Chris seem completely mismatched  - he's materialistic, while she wants to save the world (and everyone in it). And there are clearly issues within their marriage.The narration alternates between Heidi, Willow and Chris, and I wasn't quite sure whether anyone was telling the whole truth. I found myself analysing the story as I went along, including how each character reacted to different situations. Each character is suitably flawed and I had no idea how the book was going to end. It's gripping all the way through and it left me with a 'book hangover' when I had finished reading the final pages.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.Letters to the LostBy Iona GreyPublished by Simon and Schuster (23 April 2015)ISBN: 978-1471139826Publisher's description1943, inthe ruins of Blitzed London…StellaThorne and Dan Rosinski meet by chance and fall in love by accident. Theirs isa reluctant, unstoppable affair in which all the odds are stacked against them:she is newly married, and he is an American bomber pilot whose chance ofsurvival is just one in five.… Hepromised to love her foreverSixty yearslater Dan makes one final attempt to find the girl he has never forgotten, andsends a letter to the house where they shared a brief yet perfect happiness.But Stella has gone, and the letter is opened by Jess, a young girl hiding fromproblems of her own. And as Jess reads Dan's words, she is captivated by thestory of a love affair that burned so bright and dimmed too soon. Can she helpDan find Stella before it is too late?Now foreveris finally running out.My verdictLetters to the Lost had me captivated from the start. This wasn't just because it was a lovely story, but also because the narrative flowed so easily.Late one evening, Jess escapes her abusive boyfriend to take refuge in an abandoned house. Injured and feverish, she doesn't dare to leave, concerned that her (ex)boyfriend will find her. A few days later, a letter arrives, written by 90-year-old American Dan Rosinski to Stella, his lost love and the original owner of the house. Dan is dying and is determined to find Stella before it's too late. Jess soon discovers a box filled with letters written by Dan, who was an American bomber pilot during World War 2. As she reads on, she becomes determined to track down Stella, but has little to go on.This is a dual-narrative story of lost love, forbidden love and developing love. It's beautifully-written and the switching between the present day and the 1940s works really well. Although the book is over 500 pages, it certainly didn't feel like it. I read it in just two sittings as I couldn't put it down.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

But with timerunning out, can Brook put the pieces together and find Caitlin before it's toolate?My verdictI read A Killing Moon as a standalone and really enjoyed it. It's the 5th book in the DI Damen Brook series. I had previously only read the first book The Reaper, missing out the other three books so far to read this one.In this intriguing plot,  Irish student Caitlin Kinnear is reported missing, yet the police are not convinced that any harm has come to her. Then their research revealed that several young women have disappeared over the last few months. When the body of one of these young women turns up, it seems that a series of kidnappings has taken place, with this one resulting in murder. Now that Caitlin's life is believed to be in danger, the race is on to find her.A Killing Moon hooks you in from the first chapter. It has a complex plot with many twists and turns. The descriptions are gruesome in places, but in keeping with the well-crafted plot. The writing flows from beginning to end and kept me intrigued al the way through. I had no idea who was behind the kidnappings.Brook is a great protagonist with a lack of social skills and twisted dark side. I now want to read the other three books even more, to see how he has developed over the series so far.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley and Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Torquil MacLeod - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Friday 14 August 2015", "text": "I am delighted that TORQUIL MACLEOD is joining me on my blog today for his Blog Tour. Torquil's latest book - Murder in Malmö - was published on 23 July 2015. So Torquil, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I came late to writing books.  Though I spent 36 years as an advertisingcopywriter, I liked to write other things on the side.  Initially, I wanted to be a comedy writer (Ionce had a joke on the Two Ronnies athousand years ago).  Then I wanted to bea screenwriter.  Despite a couple ofcommissions, I realised that it was almost impossible to get a script onto thescreen without an amazing amount of luck. But with a lot of unused scripts/treatments on my hands, I thought itwould be an idea to turn one or more into books and see what happened.  Meet mein Malmö came from a film treatment. Unlike the film industry (and advertising), there are fewer people tointerfere with the creative process.Where do your ideas come from?Some ideas just pop into my head and others come from what Isee on TV or read about.  (For example, everyday I read thelocal.se, which is an English language Swedishinternet newspaper).  Other ideas comefrom ordinary conversations that suddenly trigger thoughts.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Personal experiences are bound to influence you to a certainextent.  There will always be elements ofoneself – or what one has seen or done - that will find their way into thecharacters and their situations.  And I’mis always borrowing bits from other people. Just ask my family and Swedish friends! My eldest son has had every flat he’s lived in in Malmö appearing in mybooks.  Fortunately for me, he’s lived inquite a few.  And we also have a verygood friend who happens to be a Swedish detective, so I’ve pinched a lot fromher as well.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Nordic blanc.Do you have any strange writing habits?During my years in advertising, I had to work to constantdeadlines, so I often work in quick bursts. And, for some reason, I’m more productive later in the day.  That’s nothing to do with being ‘not amorning person’ but I do find numerous ways to faff around earlier in theday.  Maybe they’re excuses not to getstarted.  And having worked in noisystudios for years, I do like to have music on when I write as I’m not used towriting in complete quiet.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I’m very much in the latter camp.  I obviously have a rough idea of a plot in myhead but often have no idea what characters will appear.  Then I see what happens.  If I’m not sure what’s going to happen next,hopefully the readers won’t either. Well, that’s the theory.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Having written all my life, I find that I can sit down andwrite straightaway.  Where I do struggle,temporarily, is usually after I’ve reached about a third of the way in.  I seem to have done a lot of writing, butthere’s still a lot more to do.  It canfeel a bit daunting.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I love reading but I am one of life’s painfully slowreaders, so I’m not fast enough to join a book group.  My two favourite authors are probably GeorgeMacDonald Fraser and John le Carré.  Theformer for the history and the humour, and the latter for the spies and thesecrets.  From le Carré I’ve learned theimportance that interviews play in providing information and moving the actionon.  Only he does it far, far better.You were born in Edinburgh and now live in Cumbria. What led you to set your Malmö series in Sweden? How much time do you spend there doing research? My elder son has lived in southern Sweden (Skåne) since2000.  For most of that time he has livedin Malmö.  We have made regular visitsand now that we have a Swedish grandson, they are even more important.   But each visit has given me the opportunityto visit locations that feature in the books and I’m always on the lookout fornew ones.  Swedish friends now take me ontrips to source new locations they think might be useful.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'It’ll happen one day'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Never give up.  If youbelieve in what you’re writing, then pursue it. If you try and take the traditional route into being published, don’t beput off by the rejections of literary agents. Not one was interested in my books. If you self-publish on somewhere like Amazon, I think the three mostimportant things (other than a good story of course) are the title, the coverand the price.  Get that combinationright and you’ve a fighting chance.  So,study the market in your chosen genre.And lastly, why should people read your Malmö series?They are an easy read and I hope they’re an enjoyablediversion in an otherwise busy life.  Peoplemay also discover a bit more about Sweden that they might not get from Swedishwriters, who assume a level of local knowledge in their domestic readership.About Torquil MacLeodTorquil MacLeod was born in Edinburgh and brought up in Durham.  His family originated from the Isle of Skye,where his Viking ancestors settled after one of their many raids.  Hence the name Torquil, which isScandinavian.He was briefly a teacher and failed insurance salesman beforebecoming an advertising copywriter.  He worked in agencies in Birmingham, Glasgow and Newcastle.  He also spent five years with the Thomsonnewspaper group in Newcastle, which gave him the background for Ewan Strachan’scharacter in Meet me in Malmö. Between 2000 and 2014, he worked as a freelance copywriter – Words That Torq - and divided his timebetween Cumbria and Tyneside, where most of his advertising/design clients werebased.  Since February 2014, he has concentrated on writing and e-publishing my novels.  He still lives in rural Cumbria with his wife,Susan.  They have two sons and threegrandchildren. Murder in MalmöPublished by McNidder & Grace Crime (23 July 2015)Synopsis: A gunman isloose in Malmö and he's targeting immigrants.

Then another prominent Malmöbusinessman is found murdered and Sundström finds herself back in the actionand facing new dangers in the second Anita Sundström Malmö mystery.My verdictMurder in Malmö is the second book in the Malmö series and is even better than the first.In this gripping book, Inspector Anita Sundström is searching for stolen paintings, all painted by a once-fashionable artist who is back with a new exhibition. Thanks to her previous actions, Anita has been sidelined by her boss. Instead, it's her colleagues who get to investigate a series of high-profile murders. At the same time, a gunman is targeting immigrants in Malmö.I really enjoyed this book. Anita is a tough female protagonist, determined to hold her own in a male-dominated workplace, with a feisty independent streak. A variety of strong characters push the story along, while the historical/political background was an interesting read.This is a complex storyline, with three interlinked crimes, and has been plotted exceptionally well. Although the book can be read as a standalone, I think it would make more sense to read the first book (Meet Me at Malmö) beforehand, to understand Anita's background and the dynamics between the police team.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Meet Me in MalmöBy Torquil MacleodPublished by McNidder & Grace (23 July 2015)ISBN: 978-0857161147Publisher's descriptionA Britishjournalist is invited to Malmö to interview an old university friend who is nowone of Sweden s leading film directors. When he discovers the directorsglamorous film star wife dead in her apartment, the Skåne County Police arecalled in to solve the high-profile case. Among the investigating team isInspector Anita Sundström, who soon finds the list of suspects growing. AsAnita battles to discover the answers amid the antagonism of some of hercolleagues, she even begins to think that the person she is becoming attractedto could be the murderer. This is the first in a series of the best-sellingcrime mysteries featuring Inspector Anita Sundström.My verdictMeet Me in Malmö is a Scandinavian crime novel set in both Sweden and England. I loved reading about the differences between the Swedish and British cultures. The fact that the narrator was seeing Sweden for the first time as a tourist enabled the author to slip facts in here and there.The book is easy to read and tightly written, with so many twists and turns that completely took me by surprise. The ending was a complete shocker though and I feel that I should read the book again to see if I missed anything - or if the author just added that on at the last moment.Yet despite the ending, I would still say this is a great read, and I certainly didn't feel short-changed. I will be reading the next book shortly.I received a copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

If the police can't help, she'll have to eliminate the dangerherself, but first she must work out who she's supposed to be...My verdictI have just finished reading A Game For All the Family, having been glued to its 400+ pages for over three hours. I found it compelling and highly addictive. This is a psychological thriller about lies, deception and mysteries, so I shouldn't really be surprised that it keeps you guessing right until the end.Justine, her husband Alex and daughter Ellen move from Muswell Hill in London to a beautiful mansion home in Devon. Soon after they arrive, Justine receives a series of threatening phone calls and 14-year-old Ellen starts writing a bizarre story of murder and revenge filled with even more bizarre characters. Then Ellen announces that her new best friend George has been expelled from school, even though the head teacher denies that George was ever a pupil there.I spent most of the book completely baffled and just went with the flow. Sophie Hannah is a highly skilled author. She has a vivid way of writing that draws you into the plot, even if it doesn't seem to make any sense! I had no idea what was going on until the final few pages, when all of the pieces finally fit together.A Game For All The Family is certainly one of the strangest psychological thrillers I have ever read. It's a mystery within a mystery, with many different layers that need to be peeled back before you realise what's going on. None of the characters are really likeable and most of them are completely quirky (or maybe just insane).I have a feeling this will be an acquired taste - a so-called Marmite book that you will either love or hate. Yet I urge others to take the plunge, follow the clues from the beginning and see what's at the other end. This isn't a book that I will forget easily.I received an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review.The Other MeBy Saskia SarginsonPublished by Piatkus (13 August 2015)ISBN: 978-0349403380Publisher's descriptionEliza Bennet has the life she's always dreamed of. She's who she wants to be, and she's with the man she loves.But Eliza is living a lie. Her real name is Klaudia Myer. And Klaudia is on the run. She's escaping her old life, and a terrible secret buried at the heart of her family.This is the story of Eliza and Klaudia - one girl, two lives and a lie they cannot hide from.My verdictFrom the blurb, I was expecting a psychological thriller. But instead this is actually an excellent holocaust-themed novel about coming to terms with your family's past.Otto Meyer in 1930s Germany is heavily involved in Hitler Youth, while his brother Ernst Meyer is in love with a Jewish girl. In the 1970s, Klaudia Meyer, living in England with her German father and Welsh father, is being teased at school for having German roots. In 1990s England, Eliza Bennett is busy spinning a web of lies, ashamed of who she really is.The Other Me is an emotional journey, with details about pre-war Germany and the Holocaust. It's very well written and is highly thought provoking, keeping the story flowing and moving at a fast pace. I loved all of the main characters, with their flaws, beliefs and regrets. Klaudia had a difficult relationship with her father, following her discovery about his role in WW2. But not everything was clear-cut as she thought. The ending was perfect for me, not only tying up all the loose ends but also with some unexpected twists.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for honest review."},

Jack's latest book - Wye - was published on 2nd June 2015. What inspired you to write books in the first place?Dinosaurs! When I was younger, I was forever making littlebooks and magazines about dinosaurs. I used to draw them fighting each other(lots of gore, I was seven) and then write little stories full of dino-factsabout who won. Much later I got into Philip Pullman’s novels and decided Iwanted to start writing again, this time with a little bit less blood and guts!Where do your ideas come from?I honestly think my subconscious must be forever thinking ofideas and pitching them to my conscious, because sometimes a premise will justpop into my head. Most of the time they’re pretty rubbish to be honest(goldfish vs. time travelling aliens, anybody?!) but just occasionally I getsomething good and run with it.Do your personal experiences influence your writing? If so, how?I think everyone’s do in some way or another. My experiencesof growing up in the countryside are completely apparent in Wye for example, and I think my youngerself’s thirst for bigger things comes across in Tethers.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Succinct.Do you have any strange writing habits?Yep! I often read my characters lines aloud and then try to act out how they’re saying them. I dothis whenever I want to write about how a character delivers their dialogue. It’sfine if the character is a young man, say, or someone about my height andbuild. But if the character is a very young girl for example, or even ananimal, things can get weird! I really do dread the day someone sees me doingit without any context!Are you a plotter or a pantser? Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I like to have a vague story plan made up of bullet points,but how I (and the characters) get from bullet point to bullet point is pure wingingit.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Definitely the time it takes. I have this terrible urge toshow the world what I’ve done well before I should, even before a particularstory has an ending. I’m getting better at quelling that urge though, at leastI hope I am ...What's the most interesting place that you have visited when researching one of your books? And what's the strangest?Both the most interesting and strangest places were all theabandoned, decaying buildings I explored whilst writing Wye. That odd mix of plant life, rust and crumbling bricks isreally eerie, and a real reminder that nature is just waiting for anopportunity to take our civilisation back. Buildings full of old junk wereparticularly creepy because you could see the remnants of bygone livesdiscarded and forgotten. Old books, videos, pictures, even cars; they really docreate the most unsettling sensations.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Of course! I’m pretty eclectic, I’ll read anything fromcrime to romance to sci-fi. I also tend to author hop quite drastically; it’sextremely rare that I read an author’s entire back catalogue, Philip Pullmanbeing the notable exception.If you were writing a book about your life, what would the title be?Gosh, tough question! It would probably be something prettyboring, maybe 'My Never Ending To Do List' – a write a heck of a lot ofthose!What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Read, read, read, read. Not just stuff from the genre youintend to write in, not just ‘good’ stuff either. Everything is helpful.And lastly, why should people read Wye?Because if you’ve made it this far through my quick fireinterview, we’re probably going to get on!About Jack CroxallOriginally trained as an environmental scientist, Jack Croxall soon discovered a life in the lab wasn't for him.

It’s exactly where she wants to be. Stella used to be someone else:respectable, loved, safe.

In her line ofwork, she’s never far from the edge, but pursuing the truth could take her pastthe point of no return.Nothing is off limits. Not for her – and not for them.But no one is truly untouchable.My verdictUntouchable should be renamed 'unputdownable'.

But she hides a dark past - one silly mistake led Stella to turn her back on her comfortable family background. When another escort is murdered, Stella is determined to discover the truth - but in doing so, she could be putting her life on the line.The plot is dark, sexy and intriguing - completely addictive. The characters are believable yet suitably flawed. Stella's own secrets are gradually revealed, as she uncovers corruption in high places. In many places, I was reading with baited breath, desperate to find out what was going to happen next but too nervous to read on.

Sarah's book - The Summer of Secrets - is being published on 13 August 2015. What inspired you to write a novel?At the risk of sounding cheesy, I can’t actually remembernot wanting to be a writer! I can still remember (with some levels of envy) howI used to write as a child: title, writing, done. No worries about voice orcliché or whether I was good enough! In my teens and twenties, I worried a lotabout what voice I should use, and generally ended up sounding like whoever I’dbeen reading last. Then later, when I was busy being mum, I’d constantly betelling myself the story of what I was doing in my head as if it was a novel.What gave you the idea for The Summer of Secrets?For a long time, my father-in-law had the hull of a boat inhis back garden. He always had plans for rebuilding it, but somehow it neverhappened. At some stage, he moved it into the garage, and he used to go and sitin it to have a beer in the evenings. When I started my MA, in one of theclasses we had to write three sentences about the book we were writing. I wroteone sentence about that, and then two more about the book I wanted to write,about a man sitting in a boat. So I decided that probably that was the one Ishould go for.Do your personal experiences influence your writing? If so, how?See above! The rest of the book isn’t based on anything real,mind, but there’s a lot of me in Helen, and a lot of what I aspired to be inVictoria, I think. While I was writing The Summer of Secrets, I’d quite oftennotice something that was happening in the street, or a hear someone talkingand realise it was exactly what I needed for one scene or another. But I thinkpersonal experiences are best when they’ve been filtered through a great dealof time. Having said that, you know they say you can’t dream a face you haven’tseen? I think writing is a bit like that. Everything is based on something that’shappened to you, or you’ve heard, or known, even if it’s warped beyond allrecognition by the storytelling process.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Evocative and accessible.Do you have any strange writing habits?I don’t think so. I often have my best ideas when I’mwalking the dogs and don’t have any paper with me. I end up repeating a phraseover and over as I walk home so I won’t forget it. I have an atrocious memory.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I had no idea about plot when I started The Summer ofSecrets. During the writing workshops on the MA, I’d sit down, usually thenight before, and bang out 2000 words. After the third lot, my tutor said,‘Don’t you think it’s about time something happened?’ Very good advice. Myboyfriend, Graeme Shimmin, is a writer as well and, when I was about halfwaythrough, he suggested I try his plotting theory (he has lots of good advice onhis website www.graemeshimmin.com),and that really helped me to focus where I needed to be going. Then I was luckyenough to have loads of help from my agent and my editor whilst I was workingon the second draft. I’m much more prepared for novel #2: I’ve done a synopsisand everything.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Getting started. I can take days building up to it, and it’slike waiting to be sick. Then I make a start and it’s all fine again.You live on a canal boat. Is this as amazing as it sounds? What are the best and worst aspects of living on a boat?I absolutely LOVE my boat. Living aboard really satisfies meon a deep level. There are so many ‘bests’ I couldn’t list them, but I love thespace around me, the community along the bank and being able to say I live on aboat. Ten years now and I still get a kick out of that! Worst? It was prettybad when we froze in for a month and had to trundle water along the towpath in5 gallon drums. And the toilet froze.How has your life changed since getting your publishing deal?Confidence. There’s nothing like someone telling you thatthey love what you’ve done. I’ve met so many wonderful people as well. And thisis what I’ve always wanted to do (see q.1). I’m a very happy bunny.You regularly review books on your website. Who are your favourite authors?So many! This was one of the questions I answered in aQ&A section in the back of the book, and it turned into an encyclopaedia ofnames! I’ve just finished Martine Bailey’s The Penny Heart, which isphenomenal, and have come across many other great books through the PrimeWriters group.If I had to narrow it down… No, I can’t do it!If you were writing a book about your life, what would the title be?'Understanding Backwards', from the Kierkegaard quote, ‘Lifecan only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.’What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Stop doing the washing up, and get on with the writing.And lastly, why should people read The Summer of Secrets?To be drawn into another time and place. It’s especiallygood, I’ve been told, if you like a book to live on after you’ve finishedreading it.

But when a stranger appears, Helen begins to question whether thesecretive Dover family are really what they seem.It’s thekind of summer when anything seems possible…Untilsomething goes wrong.My verdictThe Summer of Secrets is a beautifully-written coming-of-age novel, with vivid poetic descriptions of river life and teenage summers.Helen's mother abandoned the family home, leaving Helen with her unhappy volatile father, who spends more time on his boat than with her. It's 1983. And with no school friends or other family locally, 16-year-old Helen plans to spend her summer as usual, on her own by the side of the river. But everything changes when the Dover family move into a house nearby.Helen becomes intrigued by carefree Victoria, her older brother Seth and their troublesome twin siblings. Helen loves the Dover family's bohemian lifestyle and seemingly exotic and mysterious past. The family provides a complete contrast to Helen's mundane life. Helen and Victoria become unlikely best friends, filling their hot summer days with mischief and laughter and sharing their secrets.But something happens that summer and the Dover family vanishes suddenly without a trace. Helen doesn't know why, and the 'not-knowing' affects the rest of her life. When a chance meeting 30 years later leads Helen to bump into Victoria again, the past comes back to haunt her. And her memories return.I didn't want this book to end. The characters were delightfully flawed and the story was highly compelling, with many revelations revealed along the way. The book took me back several years to my teenage summers, providing a perfect read for a summer afternoon.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Joel Hames", "date": "Friday 7 August 2015", "text": "I am delighted that JOEL HAMES is joining me on my blog today. Joel's latest book - The Art of Staying Dead - was published on 26 May 2015 and is available from Amazon. So Joel, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I’d always wanted to write. As a child I loved coming upwith stories and spent more time than was good for me making things up asopposed to making things add up. I suppose that was why I ended up doing adegree in that most useful of subjects, English lit. After that I became alawyer and then a banker and just assumed all that making stuff up was achildish thing I’d put behind me.But in 2009 I decided I’d had enough, packed the family upand moved away from the City up to the rural north-west of England. My wife’sbusiness was geographically transferable, so that kept us going while I decidedwhat I was going to do with the rest of my life. And in between looking afterthe kids and experimenting with various half-arsed business ideas, I decided(with, I must admit, much prompting from my wife) to give those old literaryambitions another crack. And thus, Bankers Town.Where do your ideas come from?The ideas behind Bankers Town came from the people I used towork with and the things we used to do – as well as the things I thought wemight do, if we were greedier and less scrupulous (or less afraid of beingcaught) than we really were.The central idea behind The Art of Staying Dead – the prisonriot and what immediately follows – was, quite implausibly, the product of adream. I woke up and there it was, fully-formed – what if you saw something, someone pointing a gun at you, in the middleof a riot, and no one believed you? And unlike Coleridge, I had the goodfortune to remember the whole thing.The sequel to The Art of Staying Dead, which is my currentWIP, is based on an idea I had while driving through the narrow winding countrylanes near home. It’s another what if?idea, but I’m not going to say any more because that would be giving far toomuch away!Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Like I say, for Bankers Town I drew on a lot of personalexperience with regard to the kind of work we did and the politics andinteractions in the office. As far as fraud was concerned, though, that was allentirely fictional (your honour). Although the characters and locations in The Art of StayingDead draw slightly on people and places I’ve known, I’d say the vast majorityof that book is based entirely in my imagination.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Fast and funny, streetwise, stylish, and surprisingly relevant.Do you have any strange writing habits?Not so much a habit, but I do find myself forced to writewith Harry Potter films and similar blaring out a couple of feet away. Doeswonders for the concentration.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I try to plot out the whole book – I write out a skeleton inMicrosoft OneNote and follow that religiously until I reach The End. At least,that’s the idea. In reality, characters introduced in the middle of a randomchapter have a habit of taking over, as do “interesting” new plot developmentsI kick myself for not having come up with in the first place, and the finishedbook ends up bearing as much resemblance to its skeleton as I do to AngelinaJolie.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Cutting scenes and characters that I’ve enjoyed writing butdon’t add anything and detract from the pace of the book. That, and going backthrough the whole thing when I insert a new character or plot development andmaking sure the preceding events and knock-on effects still flow properly anddon’t give too much away.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I’m a bit of a literary snob and love Joyce, Dickens,McEwan, Chatwin, David Foster Wallace, Ishiguro, Austen. My favouritecontemporary writer is probably Jasper Fforde. Lately – thanks to THE Book Club on Facebook – I’ve discovered a host of really wonderful, imaginative and accessiblewriters like Eileen Wharton, Janine Cobain, John Bowen, John Marrs, and I’msure I’ll come across a whole lot more.How has your life changed since becoming a published author?I still find it difficult to take the fact that I’m a“writer” seriously, but now if I say I’m “working” and what I mean is I’msitting down at a computer making stuff up, I don’t have to mumble “kind of”under my breath and slink away red-faced.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'Are You Sure You’ve Got The Right Joel Hames?'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Give it a go, don’t be scared, and please, edit or getyourself edited by someone with a decent grasp of grammar and spelling.And lastly, why should people read your latest book?Because it’s fast, thrilling, imaginative, surprising, funny,and just really bloody exciting.About Joel HamesJoel Hames lives in rural Lancashire with his wife and two daughters, where he works hard at looking serious and pretending to be a proper novelist. Joel writes what he wants, when he wants to (which by coincidence is when the rest of the family choose to let him). His first novel, Bankers Town, was published in 2014, and The Art of Staying Dead followed in 2015.Find Joel Hames on his website and official Facebook page and follow Joel on Twitter - @joel_hamesThe Art of Staying DeadPublished by Amazon (26 May 2015)Synopsis: A prisoner who doesn't exist.A lawyer who doesn't care.A secret buried for thirty years.Sam Williams' idea of an important decision is whether to have another kebab for lunch. He's spent ten years running away from other people's pain, and he's learned not to look back. Sam needs a client, and for a human rights lawyer with a flexible conscience and an impatient landlord, a high security prison seems a decent bet to find one. But now the bodies are mounting up, the decisions are getting serious, and the pain isn't someone else's any more.Someone wants him dead, the police would like a word, and there's nowhere left in London to hide.

The books measure 17cm x 17cm.The pictures are exquisitely drawn with some tiny details in most pictures. This does mean that you need good eyes (or, if not, a magnifying glass) to do some of the colouring. You also need very sharp pencils or pens with a very fine nib.Underwater: Tropical:Birds:I used Derwent Academy Colour Pencils, which worked beautifully. I loved blending them with a Derwent Blender pencil. I also added in some Derwent Academy Flip Metallic Pencils. And I used a mixture of Staedtler triplus colour pens, Staedtler Fineliners and Crayola washable pens. One of the darker shades of pen did go through the page slightly, but this may have been because the pen was a bit scratchy or I pressed too hard. None of the other pens could be seen through the page.I received copies from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Fiona Cane", "date": "Thursday 6 August 2015", "text": "I am delighted that FIONA CANE is joining me on my blog. Fiona's fourth book - The Other Side of the Mountain - is out today (6 August 2015). So Fiona, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I was one of those children who had imaginary friendsand who loved playing imaginary games and writing stories. English Literatureand drama were my favourite subjects at school – I loved acting and reading. Iused to read by torchlight under the covers after lights-out. I was really intoEnid Blyton and Aruthur Ransome but I read anything I could get my hands on. Mymother wasn’t really into books but my Dad loved Daphne Du Maurier and H EBates, so I read those, and my brother’s books about the schoolboy, Jennings,Ian Fleming’s James Bond Stories, The Lord of the Rings. And then I discoveredmy grandparents had the entire works of Thomas Hardy. That was like hitting thejackpot. I always wanted to write but it wasn’t until I was diagnosed with endometriosisthat I actually sat down and gave it a go. Being housebound provided the trigger.Where do your ideas come from?That’s a question I’m asked a lot. Usually I’ll betalking to someone, or listening to something on the news or walking the dog,and I find myself thinking what if …? For example, what if a mother was sodetermined her child should succeed she was prepared to kill? This seed of anidea resulted in ‘The Gate’.  I was a parent at a prep school and therewere quite a few pushy parents at the school gate!Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?In some cases, yes, although not always in the obviousways. My first book ‘Killing Fame’ was set against the backdrop of the filmindustry, which was influenced by my experience as a film PR. I was also thevictim of a stalker, which helped with the fear the central character feels inmy second novel,’ When the Dove Cried.’ The less obvious influences are the unusualsituations I’ve been in which aren’t particularly notable but which bring athree-dimensionality to a particular scene, or a strong emotion I’veexperienced that I can ascribe to a character. I think it’s true to say themore experiences you have had the better. But never discount the power of theimagination. Or listening to other people’s experiences. And reading.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Page-turning.Do you have any strange writing habits?I always wear my grandfather’s top hat when I write!Ha ha. Not really, other than a habit of sitting in very strange positions whenI’m really into the story. Consequently I get terrible neck ache.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads youI tend to write a rough outline, the thread of thestory, if you like, as well as in-depth character biographies. My agent alwaysasked for a synopsis but that doesn’t work for me. The characters only reallycome to life when you start writing. And then they start to act in ways youhadn’t planned, and think autonomously, (well sort of) and that’s the excitingthing about developing a story. You roll with it and see where it takes you.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Handing my precious first draft over to an agent oreditor who then pulls it apart.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I read voraciously. I’m passionate about Hemingway,Fitzgerald and Hardy but my favourite current authors are Ann Patchett, KateAtkinson, Donna Tartt, Kate Morton, Rose Tremain, Mark Mills and DavidMitchell.Your latest book, The Other Side of the Mountain, is set in Haiti. What inspired you to choose this setting, and how did you go about doing your research?I was watching the TV coverage of the 2010 earthquakethat devastated Haiti. Aside from Papa Doc, it’s a country I knew very littleabout but listening to the coverage, my attention was grabbed. I ordered a bookfrom Amazon about its history, which was so interesting I ordered another aboutthe struggles of Haiti’s women during its violent political history, and thenanother about Paul Farmer, an inspirational American doctor-anthropologist who foundeda hospital with Ophelia Dahl when he was only 23. By the end I’d readtwenty-eight books, including one on Vodou and several novels by Haitianauthors. I was hooked. The plan was to visit, but my husband and I hit a toughtime financially, almost losing our house and his business, and I couldn’tafford to.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?My life isn’t interesting enough but, being a tenniscoach as well as an author, 'Between the Lines' seems somehow appropriate.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Don’t give up when the going gets tough. Stick at it,particularly at the editing stage. And believe. If you don’t, no one else will.And lastly, why should people read The Other Side of the Mountain?They should read The Other Side of the Mountainprimarily to be entertained and moved; there’s a very powerful love-story atits heart. But also because it’s a gripping tale about three very different anddetermined women, shot through with humour and set in a complex and intriguingcountry. Dreda Say Mitchell, prize-winning author of Running Hot, Geezer Girlsand Vendetta, describes it as ‘Both haunting and exhilarating, this beautifullywritten tale will keep you turning the pages until the very end.’About Fiona CaneFiona Canegraduated from Exeter University with a degree in Philosophy. She worked infilm and entertainment PR before moving into sports management and tenniscoaching. She lives in Sussex with her husband and two children.

{"title": "Techbitch by Lucy Sykes and Jo Piazza", "date": "Wednesday 5 August 2015", "text": "TechbitchBy Lucy Sykes and Jo PiazzaPublished by Penguin (4 June 2015)ISBN: 978-1405918688Publisher's descriptionImogenTate, editor-in-chief of Glossy magazine, is a legend in the fashionworld. But when she returns from a sabbatical to find her twenty-six-year-oldformer assistant, Eve Morton, behind her desk, she realises times are changing.Armed witha business degree, naked ambition and an iPhone, Eve announces she has beenbrought in to turn Imogen's beloved magazine into an app. With herself at thehelm.In thisterrifying new world, Imogen is almost invisible. In place of her team of dedicatedstaff is a constantly evolving line of twenty-something bloggers at their desksday and night ('Only losers need sleep!'), amateur snaps instead of elegantphoto shoots, and a URL address in place of Imogen's glossy pages.But Imogenisn't ready to give up her hard-earned career without a fight. Where Eve hasTwitter followers, Imogen has experience, talent and real relationships, andshe's prepared to fight for the fashion world she knows and loves. Even if itmeans going to war with a ruthless Techbitch ...My verdictTechbitch made my laugh out loud in several places. Having worked in the consumer magazine industry for several years, I recognised many of the different character types. The book certainly blends fiction and reality well.Imogen is an Editor in Chief in the cut-throat fashion magazine industry. But after six months of sick leave, she's back to work to discover that everything has changed. Glossy magazine is now turning into an app, enabling people to click and buy fashion items as they read, rather than a newstand magazine. And it's being run by her former assistant, Eve, who is now a Harvard graduate, completely ruthless and will stomp on anyone to get to the top.Techbitch is a well-written fast-paced 'chick lit' read filled with many fantastic characters. And there's hardly any romance in sight, focusing mainly on the workplace, which certainly makes a change. I was rooting for Imogen all the way through, wanting her to give Eve a good shove (out the window of a tall building).My only bugbear was that I was 'surprised' that Imogen was so un-tech savvy and that everything at Glossy had changed so much in six months - Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter have been around for a lot longer than this. And she's only in her 40s - I could understand if she was much older than this. But otherwise, Techbitch was a great read.I received a copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.TenacityBy James LawPublished by Headline (30 July 2015)ISBN: 978-1472227881Publisher's descriptionSuicidemust be investigated.Especiallywhen a Royal Navy sailor kills himself on a nuclear submarine, only days afterhis wife's brutal murder.NowLieutenant Danielle Lewis, the Navy's finest Special Branch investigator, mustinterrogate the tight-knit, male crew of HMS Tenacity to determine ifthere's a link.Isolated,and standing alone in the face of extreme hostility, Dan soon realises that shemay have to choose between the truth and her own survival.Justicemust be served, but with a possible killer on board the pressure is rising andher time is running out...My verdictTenacity is a fast-paced thriller. It's the first one I have come across that's set on a submarine and I was engrossed from the start. It's a fascinating story, with great descriptions of submarine life. I learnt a lot by the end of the book.Investigating the apparent suicide of a Royal Navy sailor, naval investigator Lieutenant Danielle 'Dan' Lewis finds herself on the submarine Tenacity, one woman surrounded by an all-male crew. There seems to be more to the case than meets the eye, but Dan could be putting her life at risk in her search for the truth. And the more time she spends on Tenacity, the more isolated she feels.Dan is a strong female protagonist. She's a great investigator. She's plucky and not afraid to speak up for herself. And she always follows her convictions, even if it means going against authority figures. But her habit of going alone often puts her into tricky or even dangerous situations.The submarine provides an intriguing setting, not just because of its size but also its claustrophobic environment, making the story chilling and highly atmospheric. Tenacity is a real roller coaster read and I held my breath for the last 10%.James Law is certainly one to watch and I hope there's another book on the way.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Sarah's second book in the Marnie Rome series - No Other Darkness - was published in paperback on 30 July 2015. What inspired you to become a writer in the first place?Reading. I found all my best friendsin books, and so it was where I wanted to hang out. Now, lots of my bestfriends are writers.Why did you choose to write crime fiction?Because the possibilities areendless, and my mind is a very dark place. I can go where the story takes mewithout worrying that readers won’t want to be there too.Why do you think crime fiction as a genre is so popular? Why do people like to read about gruesome crimes?Not just gruesome crimes—humancourage and frailty, the best and worst of the world. I think it’s popular forthe same reason that the Greek myths were popular. It speaks to our fears,offers up heroes, and helps us hope.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Visceral,unsettling, emotional.Do you have any strange writing habits?I only rarely switch off the WiFiwhen I’m writing. I like white noise and a degree of distraction (Twitter isperfect) because it syphons off stray thoughts that get in the way of my story.Are you a plotter or a pantser? Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?Pantser. (Or panther; spell-checkinsists I’m a panther.) I want to be surprised when I’m writing. It’s scarier,but it makes for a much better book.How do you go about researching difficult subjects, such as domestic violence and women's refuges?From first-person accounts. Ifthere’s a true account I will always read that before I look for textbooks ordry data.How easy is it for you to write disturbing or gruesome scenes?Too easy.

Linwood Barclay's latest book - Broken Promise - is being published by Orion on 10 September 2015. Linwood Barclay will be at Bloody Scotland in Stirling on Sunday 13 September 2015. Click here for more details. So Linwood, what made you choose to write thrillers rather than novels in any other genre?I don’t think I’d be any good doing anything else. I’vealways enjoyed crime fiction, way back to when I was reading the Hardy Boysadventures. The first stories I wrote, when I was about ten years old, werebased on TV spy and detective shows. I like that crime fiction demands strongplotting, and for me, plot is the engine of the novel.How have now published 13 novels, soon to be 14. Do you worry that you will ever run out of ideas? Where do you get your inspiration from?For 14 years I wrote three columns a week for the TorontoStar, and if you said to yourself, oh my God, I have to write nearly 150columns this year, where will I get all those ideas, you’d panic. But what Itold myself was, I need a column idea for Friday. I got one and I wrote  it. The next day, I’d come up with an ideafor Tuesday’s column, and would write it.Books are a bit like that. I need ONE great idea this yearfor a book. When I believe I have one, I get to work. I don’t worry about theones that came before, or the ones that will come in the future. You takethings one book at a time. And something always comes along to inspire you,generally from everyday events that, as a writer, you view from a somewhatdifferent perspective.Did you always plan to write a sequel to No Time for Goodbye (No Safe House, which was published in May 2015, seven years after the original book)?No. My US publisher, a few years ago, raised the idea of mydoing one. And seven years later seemed like a good time to revisit the Archersand see how they were doing. Not too well, as it turned out.What is your favourite of your current published books? Which one would you recommend to someone who hasn't yet read any of your books?That’s a tough one. I like different books of mine fordifferent reasons. For example, No Time for Goodbye was a huge hit and got myname out there, and it’s a good book, but I don’t think it’s my best. Thatmight be Trust Your Eyes. And Broken Promise, and the two books that willfollow it (they are written) are the most ambitious novels I’ve done.Would you say that your journalism background has influenced or shaped your fiction writing? If so, in what way?Journalism influenced my work ethic more than the workitself, I think. When you work at a paper, and are expected to produce copy ona regular basis, you learn the importance of deadlines, of getting somethingdone. So writing a novel for me is very much WORK. It’s work that I love, butit is work. I sit down every day and expect to get a certain amount done. Idon’t wait for the muse to strike.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Page-turning. That leaves nine words. Or eight, depending onhow you feel about hyphens.Do you have any strange writing habits?I’d say no. I think this relates back to the question aboutjournalism. As long as there’s coffee, I’m good to go. One thing: I can’t writewith music on. I love music, but I find it too distracting when I’m in thethick of writing.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing to see where it leads you?A bit of both. I need a way into the novel – a really goodhook that grabs the reader – and I need to know the backstory to that opening.I need to know the major players and who did what, and roughly how the storyends. Once I have that, I start writing. I don’t see all the opportunities thatexist in a novel until I get into it.I'm a big fan of your books. You take ordinary people and put them into extraordinary situations. How do you make sure that your characters remain believable and realistic, no matter what you throw at them?Well, I certainly hope they’re believable. I suppose I askmyself what I – and I think I’m a pretty ordinary person – would do in thesituations I’ve placed my characters in. For example, there have to becompelling reasons for someone who has no experience in dealing with dangerouscharacters to not go to the police. There has to be something huge at stake,and that’s usually a loved one. Ordinary people can find extraordinary reservesof courage when the stakes are high enough.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?I did write a book about my life, and it’s called LastResort. Out of print, but you can download it. It tells the story of myformative years, when my parents bought a cottage resort and trailer park (whatyou’d call a caravan) in the Kawartha Lakes region of Ontario. At the age of16, my father died, and I essentially was running the family business for my mother.Ultimately, it’s about breaking free from the business – and my mother – topursue a writing career.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Read Stephen King’s OnWriting. He says it all better than any other writer has. But I would say, ifyou’re a writer, you must also be a reader. You must be reading a lot, and youshould already be writing, even when you have no expectation that what you arewriting will be published.Broken Promise, which is being published in the UK in September, is the first of three linked novels about a New York town called Broken Falls. What made you decide to write three linked novels rather than standalones?I wanted to do something more ambitious, something thatwould intrigue readers in a way I haven’t before. The good thing is that peoplewon’t have to wait a full year between books. They will come out about eight tonine months apart.And lastly, can you tell me a bit about Broken Promise and why people should read it?David Harwood – the hero from my  novel Never Look Away – tries to sort outwhat really happened with his cousin Marla, whose baby died at birth ten monthsago, but is found caring for an infant whose mother was just brutally murdered.Has her personal tragedy led her to kidnap this child? To kill that mother?Meanwhile, strange – and possibly linked – things are happening around PromiseFalls. There’s a ritualistic animalkilling. A decommissioned Ferris wheel comes to life. A predator is stalkingstudents at the nearby college. Someone, it seems, is trying to send the town amessage. But why? What’s the message?Why should people read Broken Promise?  It’s the best thing I’ve done, and it’s greatfun. Well, not for the people in the story, but for people who love thrillers.About Linwood BarclayLinwood Barclay is married with two children and lives near Toronto.

Someone's getting murdered.In a dark, dark woodNora hasn't seen Claire for ten years. Not since Nora walked out of school one day and never went back.There was a dark, dark houseUntil, out of the blue, an invitation to Clare's hen do arrives. Is this a chance for Nora to finally put her past behind her?And in the dark, dark house there was a dark, dark roomBut something goes wrong. Very wrong.And in the dark, dark room…Some things can't stay secret for ever.My verdictIn a Dark, Dark Wood is an atmospheric psychological thriller. I read this in two one-hour-long reading sessions, unable to put this highly-addictive book down. Set in an isolated house in a dark wood, it lives up to the title, with a creepy story about catching up with old friends.Nora hasn't seen Clare for 10 years so is very surprised to get invited to her hen weekend, although bizarrely not to her wedding. Torn between deleting the emailed invitation or accepting out of curiosity, she decides to take the plunge, unaware that this is a decision that she may come to regret.Nora joins a handful of Clare's past and present acquaintances in an Agatha Christie-style plot. Take a group of virtual strangers and stick them in an isolated location, cut off the rest of the world as the phone lines go down and mobile coverage is scarce. Then see what happens when the going get tough…On the whole, the writing is edgy, the pace is fast and the plot is fairly dark and sinister. The chapters alternate between the present day and Nora's memories of the weekend. She's confused and can't remember exactly what happened in the woods.The plot strikes close to the bone. Most people have had an opportunity to meet up with old friends (whether just on a day out or at a school reunion). This book may make you think twice about accepting the next invitation.The only reason I can't give this five stars is because of the ending. The culprit did come as a surprise. But without giving away spoilers, I felt that Nora's actions were a little too clichéd for me and, as a crime fiction writer, I would have expected her to have had more common sense. I also felt that while there were some good twists, the underlying reason for the whole book wasn't quite dark enough for me (and not as dark as the story suggested).But I would certainly recommend this to anyone who loves psychological thrillers.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

I'd got away with it for far too long. I stammered out \"Yes, thatwould be lovely\" when really I wanted to brandish a crucifix and leap outof the nearest window.We weregoing on holiday with the in-laws.A villa wasbooked. It wasn't the villa I would have booked but then again every villa I'veever booked has been infested with ants and blessed with a smell somewherebetween 'old onions' and 'hidden corpse'. It wasn't in the country I'd havechosen, and the decor - a folksy blend of cheap and cheerless - wasn't to mytaste.I don'tthink I'd have hired one big minibus - \"So we can all be together!\" -and I certainly wouldn't have packed  a suitcase full of teabags and Spam.But I had no choice. The only way to escape this fortnight in the sun was tobuild a time machine, travel back to the nineties and ignore my husband when heasked me out. (I say \"asked me out\"; I mean \"lunged at me in awine bar\".)Not that myin-laws are  bad people. On the contrary, they're good people. But Iprefer them to be good in their own house, and not at the end of my bed tellingme to get up and join them on a bike ride so I don't miss the best part of theday.Like adouble agent, I smiled and pedalled and ate Pop Tarts, all the while countingdown the minutes to the moment we would clamber back into the hated minibus anddrive to the airport (allowing the mandatory three extra hours for the journey\"just in case\".)I didn'tcare, you see, because I had a book.The bookbecame my refuge, my saviour, the place I went when the anecdotes about myhusband's childhood - normal, uninteresting, a lot like yours and mine - cameout for the umpty-fifth time. The book was a lover I ran to when my own belovedfell asleep on a lilo. It was the friend I cosied up to when my child cruellypreferred my mother-in-law's lap to my own.I thoughtI'd brought two books, but no, there was only one in my suitcase. I wasreminded of the time I brought one shoe to Paris, only this was much worse. Ihad to read slowly, even though I was enjoying every word and I wanted to gulpthem all down like Haribo, or sauvignon blanc. (They're very good together, bythe way.)The bookbegan to show the strain. There were smears of sun lotion across the prologueand a corner was wrinkled where it had been splashed by show-off diving fromthe male contingent. There were wine stains on the cover, and a Pop Tart smudgeon the acknowledgements.And then itwent missing. I froze, despite the sun. I stood in my ill-advised swimsuit(when will I learn about ruching?) and ordered myself to stay calm. After asearch that left the villa looking burgled, I saw the book in my husband'shands. A brief scuffle followed but I won.Becausenobody - nobody - gets between me and my book on a family holiday.A Very Big House in the CountryBy Claire SandyPublished by Pan Macmillan (30 July 2015)ISBN: 978-1447276258Publisher's descriptionFor one long hot summer in Devon, three families are sharing one very big house in the country.

But will someone else beat herto it?My verdictA Very Big House in the Country has some great 'laugh out loud' moments from the beginning, as Evie and Mike set off on their summer holiday with their family in tow.Three seemingly mismatched families are taking a holiday together in a huge country house in Devon. You know from the outset that this holiday is likely to be a recipe for disaster. There's Evie and Mike with their three children, including moody teenager Scarlett. Clive with his trophy wife Shen and their young son Miles and baby Fang. Plus there's nanny Elizabetta and Clive's wayward teenage son Zane. And lastly there's the very jumpy Paula with her husband Jon and children Tilly (another moody teenager) and Amber. Oh, and don't forget the two dogs.A Very Big House in the Country is a very easy holiday read. The book is filled with various madcap moments. There's also a clash of personalities, lifestyles and parenting skills, not to mention secrets revealed and a teenage romance. Some of the holidaymakers get closer than expected, while others learn a thing or two about themselves, as well as each other.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour:"},

He tells her thather mother has had an accident and that she is to live with him for now. Asdays become weeks with her new family, 8-year-old Carmel realises that this manbelieves she has a special gift...While hermother desperately tries to find her, Carmel embarks on an extraordinaryjourney, one that will make her question who she is - and who she might become.My verdictThe Girl in the Red Coat starts off in a whirlwind. Beth has always been worried about losing her daughter Carmel, whose head is always in the clouds. And when eight-year-old Carmel goes missing from a festival, her mother's nightmare begins.Unlike other 'child missing' books, The Girl in the Red Coat doesn't focus on the police investigation. Instead, it concentrates on the tragedy of separation, told from the points of view of both Beth and Carmel. Beth clings to the hope that Carmel will be found and finds it difficult to imagine a future without her daughter. Yet her life has to move on (one way or another). Meanwhile Carmel doesn't realise she is missing, having innocently believed the pack of lies told by her abductor. But in the back of her mind, she knows that she mustn't forget her past and who she really is.The Girl in the Red Coat is beautifully written with a magical poetic quality. Although this imaginative page-turner has a chilling undercurrent, it isn't a depressing read. It does, however, pull your emotions in all directions. I spent the last 10% of the book with tears flowing, yet still didn't want the story to end.If you're looking for a psychological thriller with a difference, I urge you to read this book.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted that GRAHAM SMITH is joining me on my blog today. Graham's latest book - Snatched From Home - was published by Caffeine Nights Publishing on 19 March 2015. So Graham, what inspired you to write books in the first place?Havingbeen an avid reader since the age of eight and a reviewer for www.crimesquad.com for the last six years,I guess it was inevitable I would at some point try my hand at writing.  Once I started writing, I found the wholecrime fiction community to be very helpful and supportive. The more I wrote,the more I enjoyed it. My dream is to become a full-time writer so I can spendmore time listening to the voices in my head.Where do your ideas come from?I takeinspirations from everywhere and nowhere in particular. The basic idea forSnatched from Home came from me wondering 'what if someone was kidnapped andtheir family couldn’t afford the ransom?' whereas I got the plot for the sequel- I Know Your Secret – from a three-second clip of a TV show I was watching. Itwas enough to me think 'what if the wrong person learned your secrets?' Once Ihave an idea, I mentally poke and prod at it until I’m satisfied it has the legs to carry a full novel and thenecessary sub-plots, themes and other elements that make a great novel. Theidea also has to be strong enough to hold my interest for the year it takes meto write and edit a novel.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how? I don’tuse personal experiences as an influence. I tend to use them as a basis for creatingcharacters' traits and values. In Snatched from Home, I created a situation wherea man let down his family in the worst way possible. When I was writing hiswife’s reaction to his failings, I imagined what my own wife’s reaction wouldbe in similar circumstances.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Fast-paced, edgy, gripping police thrillers   Do you have any strange writing habits?That’sa tough one to answer as what's normal for me may be strange to others. Themajority of my writing is done with me sitting on the couch with the laptop on… well, the top of my lap. I have the TV on in the background and I just write.I try to get something writing-related done every night after my son goes tobed.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?Once Ihave the central idea as mentioned earlier, the setting and the characters, Ijust start writing and work towards what I know the resolution should be. HowI’ll get to the resolution is a mystery to me and that’s the way I like it.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Ialways find the editing to be the hardest part. When I’m editing, I workridiculous hours so I can get it done in the shortest time possible. It’s myway of maintaining my author voice.Has your life changed since becoming a published author? If so, how?Nothinghas really changed for me other than the recognition I get from reviews. Iattended a birthday party recently and before I had been there five minutes a lovelylady came across the room and told me how much she’d enjoyed Snatched fromHome.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I enjoybooks by so many authors, I couldn’t possibly pick favourites. However, booksby Matt Hilton, Michael Malone, Eva Dolan and Stuart MacBride are always put atthe summit of Mount To-Be-Read if that helps.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?Itwould have to be titled after a cream I invented to cure the ache of fox fur.Therefore it would be called 'Fur Fox Ache'.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?I wouldalways recommend that aspiring writers read five books in the chosen genre.After finishing each book they should write a review. The review should be atleast 250 words long and feature comments on pace, prose, plotting, charactersand the emotions the book garnered from the reader.And lastly, why should people read your latest book?Peopleshould read Snatched from Home because it’s a fast-paced thriller packed withbelievable characters and tense situations.About Graham SmithGraham Smith is married with a young son.

I liked the author's style of writing and this was an easy read. From the blurb, I was expecting more of a psychological thriller, but there was little of the 'thriller' aspect.

{"title": "What Milo Saw by Virginia Macgregor", "date": "Friday 24 July 2015", "text": "What Milo SawBy Virginia MacgregorPublished by Sphere (Hardback and Kindle edition - Out now; Paperback - 13 August 2015)ISBN: 978-0751554274Publisher's descriptionNine-year-old Milo Moon has retinitis pigmentosa: his eyes are slowly failing and he will eventually go blind. But for now he sees the world through the pin hole and notices things other people don't. When Milo's beloved gran succumbs to dementia and moves into a nursing home, Milo soon realises there's something very wrong at the home. The grown-ups won't listen to him so with just Tripi, the nursing home's cook, and Hamlet, his pet pig, to help, Milo sets out on a mission to expose the nursing home and the sinister Nurse Thornhill.My verdictWhat Milo Saw is a sweet touching book with an emotional message. It's all about hope, sadness, forgiveness, letting go of the people you love and finding out where you belong.I fell in love with nine-year-old Milo and his pet pig Hamlet from the outset. Milo suffers from a progressive eye condition called retinitis pigmentosa, which means that he currently sees the world through a 'pinhole'. But Milo doesn't let his disability interfere with his life - it just makes him see the world differently. In fact, he often sees what other people miss, probably because he has to concentrate more on the world around him.Mum Sandy is struggling to cope with ageing great-grandma Lou, and decides that it's time for Lou to move into a care home. But Milo feels that something isn't right soon after Lou moves in. The care home residents aren't being looked after properly, so Milo comes up with a plan to get his gran back home as soon as possible.The author has a lovely way of writing, with words that flow seamlessly off the page. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. When I reached the final chapter, I didn't want to leave the characters behind, from capable Milo to sweet Lou and Sandy, who is struggling to pay the bills. The relationship between Milo and Lou (who hasn't spoken in years) is very moving, while Hamlet the pig brings some humour into the story.What Milo Saw is gorgeous and heart-warming and I will be recommending this book to my friends and family.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Neil's latest book - The Domino Killer - is being published by Sphere on 30 July 2015. How did it feel landing a publishing deal?Strange. It was a mixture of relief,elation and disbelief.I’d been writing for around twelve years,although perhaps only seriously for five or six years. It had always felt likethe door was ajar, with things happening thatgave me encouragement, like securing an agent, but it had got to the pointwhere I thought it just wasn’t going to happen for me.I’d made a decision to write threemanuscripts, and if I didn’t succeed, I’d take the hint and get on with mylife. I was a full-time criminal lawyer and had a young family, so I could onlydevote so much time to it. It was frustrating, because it felt like it alwayshappened to someone else, but I knew the odds were against me.As it turned out, I got lucky. I had anagent who never stopped trying, and when HarperCollins set up a new imprint,Avon, and they were looking for new British writers, she did her work. I setout with a three-book deal from at the same time as people like Claire Seeberand Lee Weeks, and since its launch in 2007 Avon has published people likeScott Mariani, Paul Finch and Luca Veste. It was great to be part of a new teamlike that, and I look back on those early years with immense fondness.The news itself came to me when I was onholiday in Mallorca, and I spent most of that second week on the phone to myagent and trying to get hold of my new editor. It was a few weeks before wewere eventually able to talk, and that was a long few weeks, wondering whetherthe offer was about to be snatched away. It wasn’t, and here I am, still here,years later, just having signed a deal for three more books, eventually takingmy running total to twelve.Has the excitement waned? How does the reality compare to the dream?No, it hasn’t, is the truthful answer. I dostill feel very privileged to do this for a living and I realise how lucky Iam. If I ever get grumpy about things, I take myself back to thepre-publication years and tell myself off.The reality is exactly how I thought itwould be: it’s a thrill. What does happen though is that you move your ownexpectations, your own goals, but that is human nature. There does come a timewhen you’ve got to stop patting yourself on the back and get on with being awriter, which is where the reality takes over from the thrill. That’s probablythe biggest risk for a new writer, that he or she spends the first year of theircontract congratulating themselves and then not putting in the same amount ofeffort into their second book as they did in their first. I’m not aparticularly confident writer, so my starting point is that what I will dowon’t be very good, and put a lot of effort into it until I’m happy with it.What do you like most about being a writer?Seeing the books in a shop. No matter whathappens, I can say that the book is mine, that I wrote it. When I first saw mybook in a supermarket, I stood there and stared at it, like a parent staringthrough the glass at a row of incubators.I should really say that the joy is breathinglife into a story, creating something, but I find writing quite hard. I likethe achievement of the finished story rather than the process itself.It also involves lots of loafing around. Ihave a dayjob still, as a part-time criminal lawyer, and that is very busy.Writing is such a slower pace, where I can call lying around “plot-planning”.The biggest thrill is hearing from peopleabroad. The thought that someone in some far-flung exotic place is readingsomething that I typed out in my little grey cul-de-sac is always rewarding.What do you dislike most about being a writer?The temptation to spend all my time loafingaround. The shouting for attention too. I’m not a big fan of the publicitytrail, the newspaper interviews, but it is all part of making people aware ofthe books.How other people perceive me has changedtoo. For me, I’m the same person I always was, good and bad, I suppose. I livein the same house, have the same view, have the same friends and have the sameinterests. Now people talk to me sometimes as if I’m some hotshot author, whenI’m just the same old Neil. A bit grumpy, too tall, too grey.Also, the self-doubts, the worries...Do you get nervous about people liking a new book?I do. I hate it when people say to me, “I’mreading your book, I’ll let you know what I think”. In my head, I’m screaming,“don’t tell me, because I know you won’t like it”. What I really mean is, “fawningonly, please.”No one reads anything I’ve written untilit’s finished and complete, and even then only my editor and agent, on thebasis that they’re in the profession and used to seeing rough-cuts.Should writers interact with their readers or stay reclusive?That depends on the author. I’m alwayshappy to interact with readers, although I don’t often reply to someone who isbeing offensive. Thankfully, I haven’t had many, but in these days of instantcontact I’ve had a few emails that have just been blunt or rude. Fine, I getthat they didn’t like the book, but just put it down and read something else.Don’t abuse me. I just delete those, assuming that what will annoy them more,not knowing whether their rant has been read.I have considered whether to draft whatsounds like a standard reply email for those, like an auto-response that reads,“Thank you for your kind email. I’m so pleased to hear that you enjoyed mylatest book. My next book is due out on …”. I figured in the end that the angryinternet user is not to be provoked.Reviews. Read or not?No. In the process of this blog tour, a lotof people have written reviews, and I’m so grateful to them for taking thetime. I have deliberately avoided reading them, however, as I get so nervousabout it. I have come to terms with the fact that negative comments (and Iconfess that “negative” in my world means anything that doesn’t gush withpraise) make me feel ill, so I just don’t look. I avoid Amazon.The reviews aren’t there to massage my egobut to inform other readers.My Friday evenings are often spent watchingrugby league on the television, and the family computer is in the same room. Mywife was once surfing as I was trying to watch a game (I’ll save that argumentfor another day) and commented something along the lines of, “I don’t know whyyou get so uptight. Of these 62 reviews of Cold Kill, 56 are three stars andabove”. In my head, I went, “six are two stars and below”. It ruined the secondhalf of the game.Do you have a favourite bad review?Of the ones I’ve read, I did get a one starreview for one of my books because the reader’s Kindle broke when reading it.Ones like that make me laugh.A reader did send me a letter, excerpts ofwhich are as follows:“I was horrified by the book, to the extentthat I can’t read anything else by you, and I can’t go to your publicreadings…. I even find myself frightened by the thought of bumping into you inthe street or wherever.”I quite liked that.What questions do you get asked the most about being a writer?The most common question is, “how much doyou earn?” I worked with one person who I would see every month or so, and shewould always ask me about the money. I can’t understand the curiosity and Inever answer. If they press and press, I end up giving them an answer that is untruebut always bound to annoy them, like a vague hint as to an enormous amountwithout ever putting a number to it.Have you ever thought about doing a Harper Lee and stopping?No, not yet. There might come a time when Irealise that the well is dry, or a publisher might even make the decision forme, but not yet. There might be a time when I’m only writing, rather than beinga lawyer as well, but I don’t feel ready to give up on the law yet. It’s goodto get out of the house sometimes.About Neil WhiteNeil White grew up in Wakefield in West Yorkshire before moving to Bridlington, a fish and chips town on the Yorkshire coast.

{"title": "The Followers by Rebecca Wait", "date": "Wednesday 22 July 2015", "text": "The FollowersBy Rebecca WaitPublished by Picador (21 May 2015)ISBN: 978-1447224730Publisher's descriptionJudith hasbeen visiting her mother, Stephanie, in prison once a month for the last eightyears. Nearly a hundred stilted half hours - hundreds of failed conversations,hundreds of topics avoided. Neither of them can bring themselves to talk aboutwhat brought them here - or about Nathaniel . . .WhenStephanie first meets him, she is a struggling single mother and Nathaniel is acharismatic outsider, unlike anyone she's ever known. In deciding to join thesmall religious cult he has founded high on the moors, Stephanie thinks she isdoing the best for her daughter: a new home, a new life, a new purpose.Judith has never trusted Nathaniel, but even she can't foresee the terrible things that lie ahead. From the moment they arrive, the delicate dynamic of Nathaniel's followers is disturbed. Judith's restlessness and questions unsettle the children who've never known life outside the cult - all except loyal Moses, who will do anything to be her friend. Meanwhile, as Stephanie slowly surrenders herself to Nathaniel's will, tensions deepen, faith and doubt collide, and a horrifying act of violence changes everything. In the shattering aftermath, no one seems safe, and for Judith and Moses the biggest leap of faith is still to come...My verdictAs soon as I heard about The Followers, I was desperate to read it. Religious cults are a fascinating topic and I'm a big fan of the TV series The Following.When struggling single mum Stephanie meets Nathaniel, she is sucked deep into his world, along with her 12-year-old daughter Judith. Moving into his small village in the Yorkshire moorlands, little did any of them know that life will never be the same again.The Followers grabbed my attention from the first page, as 22-year-old Judith visits her mother in prison, one of many similar visits over the years. As the story then flips back to the past (10 years ago), it slowly unravels the events leading up to the present day.The Followers made me gasp, cry and hold my breath several times. I loved all of the characters, as they felt so authentic and passionate about what they believed in, with a vulnerability that made them all easy to control.  I couldn't help but feel great empathy for Judith, whose world was turned upside down by her mother's irresponsible and rash decision to move in with a man she hardly knew.I read the book in two short sittings, ignoring the household and unable to stop reading until I reached the final page. It's a sad, creepy, and horrifying story, in a chilling atmospheric setting - so well plotted that it flows seamlessly from beginning to end. The narrative gave me little time to breathe, as I swiftly turned the pages to see what would happen next.The Followers is a brilliant book and left me thinking about the story and characters for a long time afterwards.I won a copy of the book in a Goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review.The HuntBy Tim LebbonPublished by Avon Books (18 June 2015)ISBN: 978-0008122898Publisher's descriptionEscape andthey’ll kill your family...Thecruellest game. The highest stakes. Only she can bring his family back alive …Rose is theone that got away. She was the prey in a human trophy hunt organised by anelite secret organisation for super-rich clients seeking a unique thrill. Shepaid a terrible price. Every moment since she has been planning her revenge …And now her day has come.Chrisreturns from his morning run to find his wife and children missing and astranger in his kitchen.He’s toldto run.If he’scaught and killed, his family go free. If he escapes, they die.Rose is theonly one who can help him, but Rose only has her sights on one conclusion. Forher, Chris is bait. But The Trail have not forgotten the woman who tried tooutwit them.The Trailwant Rose. The hunters want Chris’s corpse. Rose wants revenge, and Chris justwants his family back.The hunt ison …My verdictI loved The Hunt. It was such an easy yet nail-biting read and the plot flowed brilliantly from start to finish. You are literally thrown in at the deep end and there's no stopping for breath along the way.Chris comes home from his daily run to discover that his wife and daughters have vanished - and there's a trail of blood in the bathroom. A stranger in his kitchen tells him to stay put and wait for further instructions. When Chris tries to call his friends and family for help, they cut him off. Then a second stranger (Rose) appears, telling him that she can save him, as long as he is prepared to keep running to stay alive.Chris soon learns that the hunt is on and he is the prey… Clients of the shadowy organisation The Trail pay to hunt humans down like wild animals. If he stops running, the clients and members of The Trail will kill him. If he escapes, his family will die instead. So he has no choice but to run for his life - no mean feat when you are a middle-aged architect who has taken up distance running as a hobby.The fast-paced action takes place among vivid descriptions of the Welsh mountains. It's clear that the author has a personal understanding of the physical and emotional impact of long-distance running, which adds to the authenticity of the plot.  This is about Chris' fight for survival - and the horrific actions of others with more money than humanity. You also learn more about Rose's past - she is the one who escaped rather than played the game - and why she is determined to stop The Trail for good.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

I love the swirling pen-and-ink drawings of familiar buildings and cities, such as the Eiffel Tower, Great Wall of China and sights of London (e.g. Big Ben, Baker Street and Camden).I chose this picture of Hyde Park, London, to colour first:I used Derwent Academy Colour Pencils, which worked beautifully. I loved blending them with a Derwent Blender pencil. I also added in some Derwent Academy Flip Metallic Pencils.The book has fairly thick paper so I also tried some pens. I used Staedtler triplus colour pens and Crayola washable pens. You couldn't see the pens on the back of the paper on the other side.Complete picture:New work in progress:This a gorgeous colouring book and I discovered that adult colouring books provide me with a great way to relax. And as with many adult colouring books, there are objects to search for (and the solutions at the back). The only downside is that I then get less reading time!I will upload more pages onto this review as I finish them off.I received a copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted that JOHN MARRS is joining me on my blog today. John's latest book - Welcome to Wherever You Are - is sold by Amazon and was published on 1 May 2015. So John, what inspired you to write books in the first place?I work as a journalist, so I get paid to putpen to paper (well, finger to keyboard). My job is to interview celebrities, bethey from TV, music and film. So writing my own words and not somebody else’scomes as a welcome break and the chance to be a little creative.Where do your ideas come from?My first book, The Wronged Sons, was inspiredby a piece I read in The Guardian … a letter written by a woman to the fatherof her five children who walked out on them and was never seen again. (Click here for the original article.) The second, Welcome To Wherever You Are, isbased on some of the many backpacking jaunts I’ve embarked upon in America.Staying in a hostel is the most amazing away to meet people of all ages, fromall walks of life that you’d never meet poolside in a luxury hotel.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?I like to take small traits from people I havemet or people I know and store them in my head, only to bring them out when Iam forming a character. So be warned if you meet me; I’m going to plagiariseyour life. Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Commercial, unpredictable, dark and with a fewplot curveballs.   Do you have any strange writing habits?I can’t write fiction in the mornings; I’m amuch better writer in the afternoon and evenings. I’m also better when I setmyself tight deadlines because I always stick to them. And I’m often moreproductive during an hour-long train journey back from work than I am sat athome in front of my laptop for an afternoon. Also I never write methodically; Ican’t do a beginning, a middle and an end; instead, I’m all over the place. OnceI know roughly where everything is going to go, I’ll start off with a middlechapter, then leap backwards and forwards depending on what interests me themost that moment.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I’ll plot my characters in my head first untilI know them off by heart. The best time for me to do this is when I turn thelights off to go to sleep. Once I have a character in mind and my brain iswinding down, I find it easier to erase everything else and focus on what I’mgoing to do with him or her without any distractions. What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?The very beginning. The thought of staring at ablank screen knowing I have to come up with about 100,000 words is horrible.Has your life changed since publishing your books? If so, how?Only in small ways. I’ve learned how toself-promote more, which was a bit of an alien concept to me as in myjournalistic career it’s been my job to promote the people I’m interviewing andnot myself. Plus I now spend much more time on Facebook interacting with readersand responding to emails and Tweets which is something I didn’t anticipatewould happen. That’s one part of this writing malarkey I’ve thoroughly enjoyed– interaction.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Not as much as I should and I don’t haveloyalty to any authors actually; I’ll judge each book on its individual merits.My current reading list includes The Girl On The Train, John Lydon’s Anger IsAn Energy and The Miniaturist. Three totally different genres.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'Marrs Attacks'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Come up with an original idea or a great twiston a popular genre and don’t give up due to apathy. If you are self-publishing,hire a good proof reader (I’ve learned that lesson the hard way!) and invest ina cover that doesn’t look home-made and then find innovative ways to promoteyourself. Once your book is written the hardest part is trying to make peopleaware it exists. 97% of self-published eBooks sell less than 100 copies intheir lifetime – make sure yours is in that 3%.And lastly, why should people read your latest book?Welcome To Wherever You Are is a twisty, turnythriller of sorts with eight main characters I hope readers will invest inemotionally. Failing that, I’m a cheap read so what have you got to lose?!About John MarrsJohn Marrs is a freelance journalist based inLondon, England, who has spent the last 20 years interviewing celebrities fromthe world of television, film and music for national newspapers and magazines.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Shelan Rodger - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Monday 20 July 2015", "text": "I am delighted that SHELAN RODGER is joining me on my blog today for her Blog Tour. Shelan's latest book - Yellow Room - was published by Cutting Edge Press on 18 June 2015. So Shelan, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I grew up among the Tiwi, an aboriginal community onan island north of Darwin. Story-telling was ingrained in the culture and maybethat has something to do with my love of stories. When I was nine, I startedthe ‘Family Magazine’, a weekly collection of news, stories, drawings andpoems, which my little brother and sister were also forced to contribute to.Then there were endless diaries, endless poems…and finally the adventure ofwriting a novel. So I have no idea really but my father also wrote and I thinkthe urge to write is something you just have in your blood.Where do your ideas come from?Gosh, good question! They seem to somehow float tothe surface and crystallize around a particular theme or notion that I’d liketo explore, and then a character is born in my head, someone who can turn theidea into her own life story.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?The settings for my novels so farare places I have lived in: Argentina, Kenya, England. Much of what is writtenabout the events in Kenya is inspired by personal experience. But the mostimportant way personal experience has probably influenced my writing is thepatchwork nature of my own life, growing up and living in different cultures(Nigeria, Australia, England, Argentina, Kenya, Spain)…I think this hasprobably contributed to a fascination with what shapes us and our sense of whowe are, which fuels my writing.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Words are eyes, windows to our outside and innerworlds.Do you have any strange writing habits?I like to write at a desk in front of a window - thereis something about looking through a window that opens me, inspires me.Otherwise the strangest habit is probably the lack of habit. I am a bit of anall or nothing person so I like to write when I know I can get completely lostin it. I love creating ‘writing weeks’: time out, ideally somewhere inspiring,where I have nothing else to do but write.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I don’t plot out the whole thing. I tend to have aclear idea of where I want to get to but no idea how I am actually going to getthere and I let that bit emerge as I write.How long does it take you to research all of the background and locations for your books?Actually - so far - not very long. Twin Truths andYellow Room are set in locations I know well and the historical contexts forboth books draw on direct experience. I did do a little psychological researchfor Twin Truths but even this was limited to a ‘push start’, which I then justran with. Most research has happened in the editing phase, checking if thingsactually make sense.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Two things. Finding time to doit! I have a full time job and it is hard to combine this with my all ornothing approach to writing. And then knowing whether it is any good or not -the judgement call about your own words and deciding what to get rid of andwhat to keep.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Yes. DHLawrence, Jane Austen, John Fowles, Lawrence Durrell, Thomas Hardy, GabrielGarcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, PG Wodehouse were among my early friends. Therehave been many since. I love writing that transports me, pushes boundaries,explores the unthinkable in a beautiful way. Authors like Milan Kundera, AliceSeebold, Kazuo Ishiguro, Paul Auster, Elizabeth Forbes, Amanda Jennings, HarukiMurakami, Khaled Hosseini, Carlos Ruiz Zafon, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Louisde Berniere, Yann Martel.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?‘Problem daughter!’ Anaffectionate, humorous term coined by my mother, who doesn’t know why I botherto invent plots and don’t just write about my own life, there is so much dramain it!What advice do you have for aspiring writers?The same advice my father gaveme: just get it out without judgement, you can worry about whether it’s anygood or not, and change it as many times as you like, once the words are on thepage.And lastly, why should people read Yellow Room?If you like a multi-layered psychological tale withdark undertones, a story which explores the power of secrets, the forces thatshape our sense of personal identity, the grey areas that flow between theboundaries of relationships, try Yellow Room, a novel set in England and Kenya,with a poignant insight into the 2008 crisis that took over a thousand lives.About Shelan RodgerShelan Rodger was born in northern Nigeria and grew up among the Tiwi, an aboriginal community on an island north of Darwin. She moved to England at the age of 11. Since then, Shelan has also lived in Argentina and Kenya. She now lives in Andalucia, Spain.

It's a beautifully-written and highly thought-provoking novel.A tragic accident has influenced all aspects of Chala's life - from her childhood friends to her hopes and dreams for the future. She has grown up believing that she accidentally killed her baby sister and has never overcome her feelings of guilt. The sudden death of her beloved step-father Philip triggers her memories of that particular day and the 'yellow room' to come flooding back.As her relationship with her husband Paul becomes strained, Chala longs to return to Africa, particularly to the lake that she was named after, hoping that this will help her to come to terms with her past. She volunteers in an African orphanage, filled with rescued street children, and then gets caught up in the country's post-election violence. When Chala discovers a secret of her own, she is forced to return home earlier than expected.The story moves quickly and I loved the detailed descriptions of Africa. The author writes with emotion and impact, using beautiful phrases and vivid language. The characters are flawed yet highly believable, and the story tugs on your heartstrings.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "animorphia (adult colouring book) by Kerby Rosanes", "date": "Friday 17 July 2015", "text": "animorphiaBy artist Kerby RosanesPublished by Michael O'Mara Books (25 June 2015)ISBN: 978-1-910552070My verdictanimorphia is one of the quirkiest adult colouring book I have seen so far. I fell in love with the pictures containing bizarre creatures, woodland settings and unexpected objects. Each page was a wonder to take in before I even sat down to do any colouring. Each picture has intricate detail, but this isn't so small that it's difficult to colour.It was a difficult decision, but I eventually chose this picture to start off with:I used Derwent Academy Colour Pencils, which worked beautifully. I loved blending them with a Derwent Blender pencil. I also added in some Derwent Academy Flip Metallic Pencils.The finished picture:There are also pages with search puzzles and drawing pages, where you add to the picture. I added the tiny details on the two centre fish with a normal HB pencil (sorry for the poor photos!).As you can see it's going to take a while to finish the page!For anyone who prefers using pens for colouring, I also started another page using Staedtler triplus colour pens and Crayola washable pens. The paper is reasonably thick, and you couldn't see the pens on the back of the paper on the other side.The finished picture:New work in progress:animorphia is a gorgeous book and, with over 45 large intricate colouring and drawing pages, it's well worth the money.

WillamsPublished by Harper Collins UK (9 March 2015)ISBN: 978-0008132743Publisher's descriptionYou’ve never met anyone like Tuesday. Shehas suffered extreme cruelty at the hands of men, and so has taken it uponherself to seek vengeance. She wants to protect and help others like her, toease their suffering. A force to be reckoned with, she lives beneath thestreets of London in the hidden network of forgotten tunnels that honeycomb thecity – and this is her preferred hunting ground.When Tuesday is connected to a series ofbrutal attacks on gang members, DI Loss takes on the investigation. Aburned-out detective still suffering the devastating effects of the unsolvedmurder of his daughter three years earlier, the case starts to hit close tohome. Because soon Loss will discover that Tuesday could hold the key touncovering the truth about what happened to his daughter…My verdictTuesday Falling is dark, intriguing and highly addictive. It's very different to other thrillers that I have read recently and is one that I won't easily forget.The first few short chapters hooked me in straight away - a graphic narrative about a violent attack on a group of boys on a London tube train. Not only do you read this from the perspective of the perpetrator herself, but also from the point of view of DI Loss, who is investigating the case. From this moment onwards, I was completely engrossed, unable to put the book down.Tuesday is a young woman with a mysterious identity. She is obsessed with revenge killings, targeting the 'bad guys'. There have been many comparisons with Larsson's Lisbeth Salander, due to her dress sense and IT skills. But Tuesday is a much more complex and damaged character, making her far more dangerous too.I don't want to give the story away. So all I can say is that as the bodies mount up, and the case becomes more complex, DI Loss becomes increasingly troubled. Who is Tuesday? And why is she doing this?While reading Tuesday Falling, I couldn't help but 'google' some of the landmarks and streets mentioned, such as Seething Lane (one of very few streets that survived the Great Fire of London). I particularly loved reading about secret underground London - the ghostly winding passages, disused bunkers and forgotten stations. I will now be searching for a book on this fascinating topic.This is a brilliant thriller that will appeal to anyone with a dark, quirky sense of humour. It made me laugh, cry and grimace all the way through. It's very easy to read, with short chapters, and the story just keeps on flowing.

Louise's women's fiction books have all been updated and are available as e-books from Amazon (published 13 July 2015). So Louise, what inspired you to write books in the first place?Ihadn’t planned to write books, as such. It was almost twenty years ago, I was working for a record company inNew York and wanted to do something creative in my spare time, whetherphotography, art, or writing – I decided on writing, and enrolled in an eveningclass at the West Side YMCA.  The tutormade us work with one character all term, so I ended up with lots of pieces ofwriting about the same person that I realised had the makings of a novel. I haven’t stopped since. Where do your ideas come from?Ooh.  Writers hate this question!  Anywhere and everywhere is the usual answer Ithink.  Stories you’ve heard fromfriends, news items, or sometimes just a ‘what if’ theme (for example, Are You My Mother? came about because Iwas fascinated in the idea of someone adopted trying to search for her birthparents, and how being adopted can affect your sense of identity andbelonging).Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?To somedegree, I suppose.  To Be Someone was written after I lost a close friend, and I wantedto set it against the backdrop of the music business, and how a band goes fromplaying in their dad’s garage to playing Wembley Stadium.  So for that one, I did call on my experiencesworking in record companies, and my friend’s battle with leukaemia.   I think my others are less based on any sortof personal experiences – my other protagonists are, respectively, anaromatherapist, an actor and a pro tennis player, none of which I have directexperience of!Describe your romantic fiction writing style in 10 words or less?Accessible,warm, page-turning, compelling, funny and emotional (I hope!!)   Do you have any strange writing habits?Notreally, although I’m trying to write standing up as often as possible, and haveto rest my laptop on top of the bread machine on a kitchen counter in order forthe screen to be near enough eye-level….Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I haveNEVER plotted out a whole book ahead of time. I just start and see where it goes. When I co-write (thrillers) with Mark (Edwards), we usually plan out inchunks what happens, but not more than about ¼ or 1/5 ahead, with littleknowledge of what will happen after that until we get to it.  And then panic!What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Plotting!  That’s one of the reasons I really likewriting with Mark, as he’s better at coming up with twists than I am.What's the most interesting place you have visited when researching your books? And what's the strangest?The most interesting place I went to was when I was researching theoriginal version of To Be Someone. PhillJupitus, who’d I’d recently met through a mutual friend at a recording of Never Mind The Buzzcocks, kindly gave mepermission to sit in on his then-radio show on London Live (I think it wasstill GLR in those days). It was brilliant, and massively helpful – and betterstill, Phill later read the book and gave me the amazing quote that I’m nowusing on the cover of the new version.Thestrangest was probably when I went on a research holiday for a scene in Games People Play where one of my maincharacters has a nasty accident on a ski slope. It was a singles holiday to the Italian Alps and I had foolishly joinedan Intermediate/Advanced group for the week, when my skiing was very much ofBeginner standard! Fortunately I didn’t sustain any sort of accident, but theother people on the holiday were pretty strange (in the way that people onsingles holidays often are, if you’re unlucky…)Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I read constantly andavidly.  I can’t remember the last time Ididn’t have at least 2 books on the go. My favourite all-time authors are Kate Atkinson and MargaretAtwood,  but there are so manyothers.  I love women’s psychologicalfiction authors like Elizabeth Haynes, Rachel Abbott, Tamar Cohen, SophieHannah and Sharon Bolton…. So many good ones out there at the moment.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?‘Regrets – I’ve Had A Few’   (Joke. Although I’m so bad at thinking up titles that Mark probably wouldn’t besurprised if I suggested it for one of ours)What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Writingis a craft and like anything else, you do improve the more you practise.  So keep practising, and if your first novelgets turned down, write another one.  Itwill be better.And lastly, why should people read your updated books?I don’tknow which one to plug because I’ve just had all four of my women’s fictionnovels republished, having updated them, given them lovely new covers and addednew material… it’s like choosing between one of your children!About Louise VossLouise Voss began her writing career in 2000 with four contemporaryfiction novels, all of which have recently been updated and reissued: To Be Someone, Are You My Mother?, Lifesaverand Games People Play.She successfully switched to publishing thrillers with Mark Edwards in2011.

Then her adoptive parents had a baby - Stella - of their own. Ten years later, they were killed in a car crash - and Emma, aged 19, was left to bring Stella up alone, at an age when she should have been partying, not parenting.Ten years on, Stella has grown up. Now 19 herself, she is beautiful, confident and happy. Emma, however, is in a rut. Her career and love life are going nowhere fast. Nearly 30, she feels she's not just on the shelf, but in danger of falling off it. But an extra ordinary confrontation with a tramp on a tube shakes her from her lethargy, and she starts on a search for her birth mother; a search which, fearful both of what she mind find and how it might affect Stella, she has been putting off for years.Are You My Mother? was a book that Emma used to read to Stella, when Stella was a toddler. Now the story of the little baby bird and the emotion and pathos of its quest for its mother haunts her as, with the help of her friend Mack, she tracks down five women with the same name; one of whom must be her mother. Emma soon finds however that her searches not so much for her mother but for her own identity. She has spent so long fulfilling roles for other people - daughter, girlfriend, sister, surrogate mother - that she has little idea of who or what she really is.Tentative at first, but soon gaining in momentum, her search begins to change her life in more ways than she could possibly have imagined.My verdictAre You My Mother? was originally published in 2011. It has now been republished and updated by the author, Louise Voss.Emma was adopted as a baby and had a very happy upbringing. When she was nine, her adoptive parents had a baby of their own. Emma loved nothing more than reading to her little sister Stella, especially a book called 'Are You My Mother?' about a lost little baby bird. But tragedy struck 10 years later, as her adoptive parents were killed in a car accident, leaving 19-year-old Emma to bring up her sister. Now that Stella has turned 19 herself, Emma decides to search for her own birth mother, something she has been putting off for years. The book follows Emma's journey as she searches for her mother, love and romance and her own identity.This is a wonderful book with a lovely story and amazing 'real' characters. It's heart-warming and believable without being overly sentimental. I fell in love with the characters and felt as if I knew Emma by the end of the book. I desperately wanted her to have some happiness and loved the twist at the end.I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Neil White - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Wednesday 15 July 2015", "text": "I am delighted that NEIL WHITE is joining me on my blog today for his Blog Tour. Neil's latest book - The Domino Killer - is being published by Sphere on 30 July 2015. So Neil, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?Iwanted to write because I thought I could. That’s as simple as it gets, really.When I was at school, it was the one thing I was any good at.  Once I started writing, however, it was muchmore difficult than I’d imagined and I gained a new respect for those who’d puttogether a book. I went from thinking I could write to realising that I wouldhave to work at it, and that it might turn out to be a long and difficult road.In fact, it turned out to be twelve years from first starting to signing adeal, with many bumps along the way.Where do your ideas come from?Thankfully,I only have to come up with one idea a year. I tend to look for things in reallife as inspiration. For instance, my fourth book, Dead Silent, was basedaround the notion of what would happen if a reporter located Lord Lucan (themain character in that book was a crime reporter). Once I’d decided on that, Ijust changed and adapted the plot and characters until it reflected what Iwanted.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Theyare bound to, and I do often use things from my own life as little asides orinstances, or people I’ve met end up as characters. What I don’t know is howdifferent the books would be if my experiences had been different. The booksreflect me, I suppose, and I do try to make them northern and blunt, like athump on the nose. If my life had been different, perhaps I’d have made themmore flowery or wordy. As it is, I’ve settled for a thump on the nose.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Pacy,not too flowery, but easy to read.Do you have any strange writing habits?I’mvery much a person of routine, principally because I’m scared of not finishinga book. I try to write a thousand words a day, and the first thing I do in theday is try to edit what I’d done the night before. A midnight poetic ramble canfeel like pretentious nonsense when in the harsher light of morning.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I tryto sketch out an idea of what the book will be about but never the whole book,as I feel like I just don’t have time. I tend to sketch out the first fifth,the first twenty thousand words or so, which gets me off the ground. Once I getto that point, I sit down with a bottle of wine, a pad and pen, and try tosketch out the next fifth.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?The next word. I live in fear of getting stuck, and the worst part iswhen I’m around two-thirds through. I know the ending, I’ve written the firsthalf, but how do I get to the end from where I am? It’s too near the end to ripit up and start again. Andreviews. I don’t read them. Like most new writers, I hogged Amazon when I firststarted out, but I realised it was unhealthy. I wasn’t looking for constructivecriticism, I was looking for gushing praise, and any lack of it would ruin myevening. So now I don’t look for reviews. The book is done, I can’t changeanything, so let it fly and people will think what they think. Blissfulignorance is better sometimes.How do you juggle your two careers - a criminal lawyer and a crime fiction author?With difficulty. Time is precious, and fitting in writing books around amentally tiring job like being a lawyer makes it hard. I’ve no current plans togive up being a lawyer but there might come a point when I decide I have to doone or the other.Being a criminal lawyer does help me in my writing though, because it’s aworld I’m comfortable in, but equally the mental effort required does sometimesfeel like I’m not devoting enough to my writing.Iregard my writing as my main job now, although if we met at a dinner party, Iwould introduce myself as a lawyer, not a writer (unless you were a TVproducer!). I think it’s because being a lawyer is what I am, what I trained todo, whereas writing is something I’ve managed to fluke. I feel privileged to beable to make a living from something I enjoy doing. I don’t treat it lightly.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I don’tread as much I’d like, due to the lack of time, but I’m a bit of a flitter. Idon’t tend to follow a particular author or series but buy what I think looksgood. There are some reliable ones though. I will usually buy a MichaelConnolly or Lee Child or James Lee Burke or Greg Hurwitz. I have read a lot ofBritish fiction recently, which was something I tended to avoid. I’ve alwayspreferred American crime fiction as it is more escapism for me. British crimefiction will commonly touch on criminal law, and too many people get too manythings wrong, which spoils the reading. If I read American fiction, I have noidea if it is right or wrong so I can just relax and enjoy the story.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'That Worked Out Okay'I’vebeen lucky and I know it. I was unemployed for so long during the eighties andwas able to reinvent my life at a time when going to university wasn’tfinancially crippling. I was able to enter criminal law at a time when it was aprofession worth entering. Now, the only people practising criminal law are theuseless or those too old to change. I was lucky enough to land a publishingdeal when so many others didn’t. I do wake up often and I’m still in thatbedsit in Bridlington, with no money for food or heating and not knowing when thenext good quid is coming from. I got lucky and I know it, and if it endedtomorrow I would smile about it.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Whatyou write at first will not be very good. If you think it is, you’re doing itwrong. Keep going, persevere, and eventually something will work out. Don’t tryto be clever. Just write the story.And lastly, why should people read your latest books?Peopleshould read my latest paperback, The Death Collector, and hardback, The Domino Killer, because they're pacy andexciting and the pages will just turn. And because my children eat so much. Andthey might want to go to university, which is really expensive.About Neil WhiteNeil White grew up in Wakefield in West Yorkshire before moving toBridlington, a fish and chips town on the Yorkshire coast.

As she was taken from me, I knew I might never see my daughter again.37 years later…'You were adopted'. Three short words and Sabina's life fractures.

On announcing that she is pregnant with her first child, Sabina can't understand why her parents don't seem to be happy for her and her husband Ted. Until her mother Megan reveals that she was adopted at birth. Her parents have lied to her for all of her 38 years and are still being cagey about her past.As Sabina delves further, she discovers that her birth mother Lily was an unmarried teenage girl sent to a maternity home by her family and forced to have her baby adopted. Sabina is more determined than ever to learn more about her roots, even if it means cutting off her own parents. The book is written from the points of view of Sabina, teenage Lily and newly wed Megan.Kelly Rimmer has written an excellent novel with a fascinating underlying background - the tragedy of forced adoptions. This emotional journey has been written from the heart. Although it is a fictional account, thousands of pregnant teenage girls experienced similar events in Australian maternity homes in the 1970s.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "The Health Benefits Of Olive Oil - Jo Thomas - The Olive Branch - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Monday 13 July 2015", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Jo Thomas' The Olive Branch, which was published on 2nd July 2015 by Headline.I would like to welcome Jo Thomas, who tells us all about the health benefits of olive oil. Did youknow a spoonful of olive oil at night is supposed to reduce snoring? Andthat’s not it’s only health benefit. Olive oilis the fat produced from olives, traditionally grown in the Mediterraneanbasin. Most of us have all heard about the benefits of the Mediterranean diet,that people living there live long and healthy lives on a diet basedon vegetables, poultry, fish, red wine and olive oil.  Olive oilis the foundation of this diet. It is said to affect cardiovascular healthand blood cholesterol levels.Accordingto the Olive Oil Times:'Olive oilbenefits are so extensive that it's considered a functional food withcomponents that contribute to its overall therapeutic qualities, including areduction of risk factors of coronary heart disease, the prevention of cancersand alternatives of immune and inflammatory responses.'This goeson to say:'A dietrich in olive oil may actually be able to slow down the aging of the heart.That it helps with inflammation, minimises cancer risk including breast cancer,heart disease, decreases blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, rheumatoidarthritis, osteoporosis and regular consumers may prevent strokes, depressionand Alzheimer’s.’It’s quitean impressive list, isn’t it?There aremany different types of olive oil, with different flavours and textures anduses. Of course olive oil is used in cooking across the Mediterranean.Different regions produce their own variety of olives, with distinctiveflavours. I went to visit a local frantoio in Puglia, a local press, to buy oildirectly from them. I saw the huge barn in which the olives are washed, pressedand ground and the oil it separated from the water.  I tried a number ofoils from huge stainless steel vats, eventually picking the one I enjoyed themost.  I was told to only use this extra virgin oil for dressing food,salads and the like.  Heating the oil can affect the flavour and you lose alot of the taste you’re paying for. So for cooking, use a lower grade oil, notextra virgin, keep that for cold foods.Extravirgin and virgin olive oil are like fruit juice, made from crushed olives.Other olive oils are refined using heat and chemicals, but according to OliveOil Times this monosaturated fat is still a much healthier option than manyother oils.You can useolive oil instead of butter or any other more unhealthy oils in the kitchen.It's said that two tablespoons of olive oil a day will benefit yourhealth and well-being. Olive oil is even said to improve mood.lt's alsosaid to be good for the skin and is used in lots of beauty products and soaps.Buyingolive oil can be a bit like buying good wine. You can start to read and learn aboutthe labels, where the oil is from and when it was harvested. Then start totaste and think about the flavours that are there. An olive picked straightfrom the trees aren’t nice to eat. They’re bitter. They have to be soaked inbrine first, then other flavours, herbs and spices can be added. But thebitterness is a good thing, that’s the nutrients. Olive Oil Times tells us weshould recognise the bitterness and cherish it; it’s the sign of fresh, healthyolive oil.All in allolive oil is said to be good for the health and good for your heart, and that’ssomething I would certainly agree with. A happy heart is what it’s all aboutfor me.The OliveOil Times website suggests we:'Replaceother fats like butter with at least two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oilevery day, eat lots of veggies and go for a walk.'That soundslike a good recipe for life to me.If you’dlike to read more about olive oil, here’s the link for Olive Oil Times: http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/The Olive BranchBy Jo ThomasPublished by Headline Review (2 July 2015)ISBN: 978-1472223708SynopsisYou can buyalmost anything online these days.

But the finer things - friendship, romance and even the olive harvest - take time to grow. Can Ruthie put the past to rest and find her own piece of the Dolce Vita along the way?My verdictThe Olive Branch is a gorgeous easy read, perfect to escape into for a 'feel good' summer adventure. Following a drunken night out, Ruthie Collins buys an Italian farmhouse, complete with olive grove, through E-bay. Too proud to admit to her family and ex-partner Ed that she's made a mistake, Ruthie packs up and heads to Italy. Arriving in her new home, Ruthie finds herself at the centre of a family feud, adopted by greedy goat Daphne and treated with suspicion by the locals. She discovers that the farmhouse was sold to her by Giovanni Bellanuovo, an elderly man who died shortly after the sale went through. Determined to renovate the farmhouse and harvest the olives, Ruthie realises that she has a lot to learn. Fortunately there are two locals in particular who offer to help her. There's grumpy Italian Marco (who wants his grandfather's farmhouse returned to the family) and easy-going Australian Ryan (who may not be the most-reliable man around). The Olive Branch made me want to book a holiday to Puglia in Italy to see rustic Italian farmhouses and olive trees. By the end of the book, I felt that I had learnt a lot about the olive harvest and olive oil. Reading one particular scene made me feel like I could taste the olive oil myself. The book is well-written, humorous and romantic (but not overly soppy or sentimental), although maybe a little predictable in places. Most of the book is narrated in the first person by Ruthie, although there is some third-person narrative by Marco. The characters were believable and very real, and I loved the large Italian family. The story flowed wonderfully from beginning to end. This was a pleasure to read and I couldn't put it down, taking me less than a couple of hours to read the whole book.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Beyond the Sea by Melissa Bailey - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Friday 10 July 2015", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Melissa Bailey's Beyond the Sea, which is being published by Arrow on 16 July 2015.I would like to welcome Melissa Bailey, who tells us about her research for Beyond the Sea. Research is oneof my favourite parts of the writing process and I do lots and lots of itbefore I even think about putting pen to paper. I think my obsession with it,apart from a passion for the detail, is fuelled by a desire to create, with asmuch precision as possible, the world in which the book is set – when somethinghappens in a novel which is inaccurate or flawed, it jars with the reader andundermines its credibility.For Beyond theSea, my research took many forms. It involved a trip to the isle of Mull to soakup the general ambiance of the Hebrides, but more specifically so that I couldtake the journeys by road and sea that the protagonist, Freya, takes in thebook. I made a later trip to the isle of Skye so that I could visit Neist Pointlighthouse, the one on which I modelled the lighthouse in Beyond in Sea, andexperience its remoteness and seclusion.As well asmaking actual journeys there, I read a lot of books on the Scottish islandswhich informed my story. The history of the Hebrides is rich, magical anddangerous, inextricably bound to its proximity to the sea. I read accounts bylighthouse keepers of the harsh realities of tending the light, of isolation,fear, depression and madness. I unearthed stories of whisky high jackings andburied treasure, letters, sealed in wooden boxes, which had been floated on thetides from St Kilda to the Outer Hebrides. It was fact that read like fiction.There wereaccounts of soldiers and sailors and shipwrecks.One inparticular caught my eye. The Swan, asmall warship, was despatched by Cromwell to the Hebrides in 1653, to suppressthe royalist uprisings there. The Swan didn’t travel alone – there were 5 othervessels in the flotilla, including theSpeedwell and the Martha and Margaret.During a violent storm on 13 September 1653, the Swan was ripped from its anchor in Duart bay and smashedagainst rocks, sinking into The Sound of Mull just below Duart Castle. It wasrediscovered in the 1990’s – along with a number of well-preserved artefacts: cannons,a wooden carved cherub, clay pipes, coins, Bellarmine jars.But while the Speedwell and the Martha and Margaret also sank during the storm, no records remain(if indeed there ever were any) as to the location of their final restingplaces. It was from these accounts that the historical thread of Beyond the Seawas born: a soldier bound for the Scottish islands, haunted by memories in ahostile seascape, an apocalyptic storm on the horizon.Eventually, Istop researching and I try, to a great extent, to forget everything I havelearnt. Huge amounts of research don’t make it into the book. But I hope that itsflavour infuses the whole world of the novel and makes it a more authenticplace for my characters to inhabit.Read my review of Beyond the SeaBeyond the SeaBy Melissa BaileyPublished by Arrow (16 July 2015)ISBN: 978-0099584957Publisher's descriptionOne summer's day, Freya's husband and son disappeared on a boating trip.A year on, and struggling to cope, Freya returns to the lighthouse-keeper's cottage on a tiny island in the Hebrides where they spent so many happy times.Haunted by visions of the life she used to have, Freya finds comfort in the discovery of her son's diary, written in the weeks before he disappeared.Until a man, Daniel, is washed up on the shore during the storm, and suddenly her dreams turn menacing. As dream and reality merge, Daniel seems to be turning up wherever she goes and she has no idea what he wants from her.Is her mind playing tricks? Or is the danger she senses real?My verdictBeyond the Sea is an emotional story about coming to terms with the past.A year after her husband and son disappeared at sea, Freya remains haunted by her memories and struggles to cope with her loss. She feels guilty for leaving her family for a few days to go on a work trip just before they vanished. Their boat was found battered and bruised, but their bodies were never found.Freya returns to the remote island where her family spent their last few days, believing that this could be the key to healing her grief. But when she finds her son's diary and belongings, it's as if he is still there beside her. Her memories come flooding back and her emotions bubble to the surface again.Beyond the Sea is actually three stories cleverly woven together. Firstly, there's Freya and her memories, as well as mysterious stranger Daniel who is washed up on the island. Secondly, there are the local myths and legends. Thirdly, there's the discovery of letters written by a soldier on one of Cromwell's ships, which disappeared in 1653.Melissa Bailey has written a haunting tale with a fascinating historical background. I loved all of the characters, although Daniel is not quite as sinister as I expected. The remote island/lighthouse setting is perfect for the story and the vivid language brought it to life in my mind. In particular, I enjoyed reading the descriptions of the unpredictable sea - violent one minute, calm the next.This was a really easy and enjoyable book to read.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Read my Author in the Spotlight interview with Melissa Bailey here"},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Jane Isaac", "date": "Thursday 9 July 2015", "text": "I am delighted that JANE ISAAC is joining me on my blog today. Jane's latest book - Before It's Too Late - was published by Legend Press on 1 June 2015. So Jane, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?Fifteenyears ago, my husband and I took a year out to travel the world and a friendgave us a diary to keep. I didn’t think we’d keep it up, but we both wrote init every day and returned home at the end of the trip with a collection ofdiaries. Years later, the photos brought back memories, but it was the diarythat recreated the true sense of the places we visited. That’s when my loveaffair with writing began.Where do your ideas come from?I think it’sa mixture of an over active imagination and nosiness! I’ve always been a greatpeople-watcher and I like to imagine putting ordinary people in extraordinarycircumstances, taking them out of their comfort zone and watching how theyreact.With TheTruth Will Out, the idea for the opening stemmed from a Skype conversation withmy best friend. I couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if two people werechatting over Skype and one watched the other be attacked through the screen.And then what if they had a secret that meant the friend couldn’t contact thepolice. The story unfolded from there…For BeforeIt’s Too Late, it was the idea of what would happen if someone was kidnappedand kept hostage in a disused pit in the Warwickshire countryside. What wouldthey go through, how would they feel, as the police work around the clock totry to find them and track down their abductor?Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?I thinkauthors always leave a little of themselves in a book. Most of my books seem tofeature dogs or cats in some capacity - DI Jackman in Before It’s Too Late hasa Labrador, similar to my own.Books are agreat medium to indulge interests too. I have a passion for travel, both in theUK and abroad, and the kidnap victim in the latest book is a Chinese student inStratford upon Avon, which necessitated a lot of research on Chinese culture inorder to get inside her head, and plenty of field trips and weekends away toexplore Stratford.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?A revieweronce described it as, ‘Writing so good, I didn’t notice it.’ That’s the bestcompliment I could ever have had.Do you have any strange writing habits?With a dayjob and a family, I can often be found penning ideas in very unusual places,like around the pool when my daughter has a swim class and jotting down notesin the supermarket queue.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads youWith myfirst book, An Unfamiliar Murder, I didn’t do any plotting beforehand and justsat and wrote whenever I had a spare moment. But when I came to write my secondI felt I needed more structure and direction. Now I draft short outlines of thestory before I begin, although often characters do unexpected things, or plottwists and turns jump in and surprise me along the way.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Actuallygetting down to it! There are so many distractions with family, work, and thevery addictive Facebook and Twitter which is made for born procrastinators likeme who like to chat!Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Of course.Books are never far from my mind, whether reading or writing. I love PeterJames’ Roy Grace series and I also enjoyed the psychological thrillers ofBefore I Go To Sleep by S J Watson and Into the Darkest Corner by ElizabethHaynes.What's the most interesting place you have visited when researching one of your books? And what's the strangest?The mostinteresting were probably a mix of the Scottish Highlands for The Truth WillOut, and Stratford-upon-Avon for Before It’s Too Late. I loved learning aboutthe history and culture of both places, and exploring the countryside in andaround them.Thestrangest experience was trudging over the fields of Northamptonshire with thefamily one Saturday afternoon, my daughter and dog running off ahead, while myhusband and I searched for potential deposition sites for a body for AnUnfamiliar Murder!If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?Ha! Ithought it only fair to ask my husband to name this one and he came up with,‘Are We Nearly There Yet!’ Apparently, I’m the most impatient person he knows.I only manage to write a novel because I do it in short snippets or scenes, oneat a time.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Read voraciously in and around thegenre you intend to work with and try to write something every day, no matterhow short. When your script is complete, send it to people who you trust togive you honest and constructive feedback, then rework until it is the best youcan do before you submit.It can be difficult to find a homefor a novel and publishers reject submissions for many reasons which are notnecessarily anything to do with your writing: It may not fit with a publisher’slist, they may have something similar, they may not be looking for submissionsin your genre at this time. So, if you receive a rejection, don’t give up; takeheed of any advice, rework your script if necessary, and submit elsewhere.And lastly, why should people read Before It's Too Late?I’m rubbish at this sort of thing,so I’ll share some of a couple of early reviewers’ comments with you. Sorry forthe cop out.‘Jane Isaac has excelled herself,producing a dark and fascinating contemporary crime read. The parts featuringMin put this in a league of its own…Very moving indeed.’ Northerncrime‘Really excellent crime thrilleragain from Jane Isaac, this time bringing us a new main protagonist (WillJackman whom I adored) and with a heart and soul for the story provided by avictim of kidnap - Min Li, whose musings whilst trapped in a dark pit, notknowing if rescue is coming, gives a beautifully crafted edge to the wholething that will keep you on the edge of your seat.’ LizlovesbooksAbout Jane IsaacJane Isaac is author of three psychologicalthrillers and lives in rural Northants, UK with her husband and daughter whereshe can often be found trudging over the fields with her dog, Bollo.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Alexandra Sokoloff - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Wednesday 8 July 2015", "text": "I am delighted that ALEXANDRA SOKOLOFF is joining me on my blog today, as part of the Blog Tour for her books Huntress Moon, Blood Moon and Cold Moon. Alexandra's Huntress Moon series is published by Thomas & Mercer. Cold Moon was published on 7 July 2015.So Alexandra, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?It was a number of factors, but one thing especially. I’ve alwayswritten very dark crime and supernatural thrillers, and when the Saw horror movies started coming out andwere so incredibly successful, every studio and production company in Hollywoodsuddenly wanted to jump on that torture porn bandwagon. I was actually asked inscript meetings to write torture and rape scenes. Well, I wasn’t going to dothat for any amount of money.But - screenwriters have no real power to say no to that kind ofdemand because you'll just be fired and someone else who will do it will be hired in your place. I knew I had to dosomething else entirely for a living, because the kind of cycle that asuccessful franchise like the Sawmovies starts can go on for years and years. So that’s when I started writingmy first novel, a very spooky college ghost story called The Harrowing. And luckily that book sold right away in a two-bookdeal and I did the maths and realised I could make a living writing bookswithout having anyone tell me what I had to write. It felt like being let outof prison!You write supernatural thrillers as well as crime thrillers. Where do your ideas come from?Ideas come from absolutelyeverywhere. I dream some of them (I think any writer who isn’t keeping a dreamjournal is working too hard!). I’m always doing random research about hauntingsand paranormal experiences, and about different aspects of crime.I also find rage a great motivator. I get tremendous inspiration from things that make me angry. Social injustice especially. My supernatural thriller Book of Shadows, and another very different crime book that I'm outlining now are both partly inspired by the gross miscarriage of justice that resulted in the accusation and conviction to the West Memphis Three in Arkansas: three teenage boys wrongly accused of the murders of three little boys. I am especially outraged by crimes against children and women: rape, abuse, trafficking. My Huntress Moon thrillers definitely draw on my rage about those crimes and my anger at society for not making their elimination a top priority.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Very much so. I could go on about this all day, but just to give one very important example - before I sold my first screenplay, I worked in the Los Angeles County prison system, teaching juveniles. The boys were mostly teenage gang kids and the girls had been arrested mostly for prostitution. Yes, they arrested the girls instead of the men who were trafficking and abusing them. The whole experience taught me a lot about the vicious circle that the so-called justice system is. We are failing our next generation, and it's heartbreaking. I know I write crime thrillers before of that early experience, and I draw on the emotion of it - and the criminal procedure I learned during that period of life - all the time.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Intense, highly visual,highly sensory, spooky and page-turning.Do you have any strange writing habits?I’m laughing.My partner, Craig Robertson, is also a crime writer and he finds it verystrange that I move around to all therooms of the house in the course of my work day. I can only stay about twohours in one place and then it feels like there’s too much energy in the roomand I have to go somewhere fresh. And I also change clothes four or five timesduring my writing day. After two or three hours whatever I’m wearing doesn’tfeel right any more and I have to change it up.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?Oh, I am a total plotter. I wouldn’t ever have beenhired as a screenwriter if I couldn’t go in and pitch the executives, producersand director the entire story, from beginning to end. I use index cards and a three-act, eight-sequence story structure grid tostart brainstorm plots. The index card method is a very common plottingtechnique in Hollywood because you often have to come up with full story ideasso quickly, sometimes literally overnight. If you’re not familiar with thethree-act, eight-sequence structure, I teach this method in my Screenwriting Tricks for Authors workbooksand on my blog.I have really enjoyed all three of your books. What made you write about a female serial killer?Thank you! When I was a screenwriter, I worked on several film projects featuring serial killers. So for several years I was doing research into the subject every way I could think of besides actually putting myself in a basement with one of these monsters. I tracked down the FBI's behavioural science textbook before it was every available to the public. I stalked psychological profilers at writing conventions and grilled them about various real life examples. I went to forensics classes and law enforcement training workshops.And while I was doing all that research, one thing really jumped out atme about serial killers. They’re men. Women don’t do it. Women kill, andsometimes they kill in numbers (especially killing lovers or husbands for money– the “Black Widow” killer; or killing patients in hospitals or nursing homes:the “Angel of Death”) — but the psychology of those killers is totallydifferent from the men who commit serial sexual homicide.  I couldn’tbelieve no one was writing about that, and so for years I’ve been thinkingabout a great storyline and characters that would allow me to explore theseissues in a series of nail-biting thrillers. I finally hit on it with Huntress Moon.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?The first draft. I love theresearch, I love the pre-plotting, I love the editing and layering once thefirst draft is done, but actually bashing through that first draft is absolutetorture. I hate it.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I read compulsively, often five books a week or more. Considering how little time I have to read, that's a lot. I love Tana French, Mo Hayder, Denise Mina, and Val McDermid - the way these authors deal with crime from a feminine perspective, and how they cross police procedure with an almost supernatural sense of evil. I'm a big fan of Stephen King, early Thomas Harris and Lee Child. And of course, my partner, Craig Robertson. What can I say - great writing is sexy!If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?The first thing that came tomind was 'Against the Current'. Which makes me think that I might be makingthings too difficult for myself! Seriously, I would never write a book about myown life. Fiction is so much more interesting.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Oh gosh. I blog and teachabout this constantly. So I guess the advice is, read my blog! Theself-publishing revolution has made it possible for more writers to make aliving than ever before. The promotional tools are unprecedented. But you needto understand how self-publishing works beforeyou hit 'publish' on that KDP upload screen.And lastly, why should people read the Huntress Moon series?Readers who enjoy serialkiller thrillers are fascinated by the way the books turn the genre inside out.Readers who are sick and tired of seeing women portrayed as victims arethrilled by the way these books turn the tables. But mostly, the books areabout haunted and haunting characters engaged in a life-or-death battle withreal forces of evil. If you like books that make you think and feel along withyour adrenaline rush, I think you’ll love them.Thanks so much for having me,Vicki!About Alexandra SokoloffAlexandra Sokoloff is the Thriller Award-winning,Bram Stoker and Anthony Award-nominated author of eleven supernatural, crime andparanormal thrillers.

A SHOCKING MASSACRE.A THREAT TO UNLEASH THE ULTIMATE DISASTER.Ex-SAS major Ben Hope has found sanctuary in a remote monastery in the French Alps. But wherever Ben goes, trouble is not far behind.When a team of merciless killers slaughter the innocent monks, Ben's revenge quest draws him into a bewildering mystery of stolen treasure, deception and murder.As he works to unravel the clues, he is confronted with a terrifying reality that threatens to cruelly reshape the future of humanity. What is the significance of an ancient curse dating back to a heretical burning? What are the real ambitions of the enigmatic 'Army of the Prepared'?The race is on to prevent global devastation, and there's only one man who can do it.My verdictThe Martyr's Curse is the 11th book in Scott Mariani's Ben Hope series. I would advise that you read the other 10 books first if you can, as this will help you to understand more about Ben Hope and his professional and personal background.In this book, we meet action hero Ben Hope as he recovers in the peace and tranquility of a remote French monastery. Living a simple existence among the monks, he is regretting his often-violent past and looking towards a far more peaceful future. But his current life is destroyed after a vicious attack on the monastery. Ben Hope vows to find the perpetrators of massacre and avenge the deaths of his friends.Ben Hope books never disappoint. These fast-paced thrillers are filled with action and adventure, as well as a hint of romance and intrigue. Ben Hope is a great action hero with an interesting background. He is ready to help out the underdog but merciless when he needs to be. In The Martyr's Curse, he is fighting against the odds to save the world from a terrifying, but very real, threat.In The Martyr's Curse, Ben Hope is far more on his own than in the previous books, as he isn't in contact with his old friends and colleagues. This didn't affect my enjoyment of The Martyr's Curse, but it would be great to get some of that camaraderie back again, as this is what makes him different from other more-solitary action heroes.As with all Ben Hope books, The Martyr's Curse is ideal for fans of action thrillers. And it makes a change from Jack Reacher, especially for anyone who prefer an action hero with a sensitive side.Thank you to Avon Books for my copy of the book (won in a Twitter competition).Click here to read my review of the previous Ben Hope book, The Forgotten Holocaust."},

It follows the heartbreak of families whose daughters appear to have been the victims of a serial killer over a four-year period. While the police continue to search for the murderer, the parents live with the knowledge that they will never see their beloved daughters again and struggle to face the future without them.Helen Purvis, the mother of the first victim, has set up Megan's Angels, a support group for the bereaved parents, named after her daughter. Unfortunately, as more girls are murdered, the group grows in number. Leanne Miller, one of the family liaison officers, supports the families as they try to move on with their lives. But it's difficult for them to do this when the killer is still at large and the media are knocking at the door.In First One Missing, Tammy Cohen has tackled a difficult subject - the murder of girls under 10. While the underlying story is a dark one, she manages not to make the book gruesome or difficult to read. The narrative plays havoc with your emotions as it switches from one character to another. You get to know their innermost thoughts and feelings as the story progresses, which makes the characters seem very real.Several of the parents come under suspicion as the police investigate, but there are also various other suspects too. I had no idea who the killer was, and this came as a welcome surprise (as I often manage to guess correctly). This is a complex plot, but well written with several twists and turns to lead the reader off track.I received an Advanced Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

Steve's book - The Defence - was published by Orion on 12 March 2015. So Steve, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?Until 2011, I'd always had the vague notion that I'd like to write but I had no real plans to start, just a vague wish that I truly had little intention of acting upon. I'd written screenplays about 15 years before, but never got any sold so I'd given up on the writing. Then in 2011, my mother passed away quite suddenly. She was the only person who ever encouraged me to write, so I wanted to honour that faith. I wrote The Defence for her, knowing she would never read it.Where do your ideas come from?Everywhere.Mostly they are crazy, high-concept 'What if?' kind of ideas that no real saneperson should ever think about. The Defence came out of two ideas. I was tryingto think about the worst possible situation for a lawyer to be in – then I gotit. What if a lawyer had to stand up in court and conduct a trial with a bombstrapped to his back? What if his client was holding the detonator? Yeah,that’s pretty bad. Once I had that idea I immediately started thinking abouthow I could make that situation worse. Much worse.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Theidea for the character of Eddie Flynn came to me one day during a trial. I’m alawyer during the day, so I was cross-examining a witness and I kind of connedhim into telling the truth. It struck me at that moment that trial lawyers andcon artists share a lot of the same skills – misdirection, persuasion,manipulation, distraction etc. So the basis for Eddie’s character was formed.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Shorty,punchy chapters. Pace, punch, wit, finger-nail-bitingly-tense.Do you have any strange writing habits?I writeat night – but a lot of writers do the same. I like to have a lot of coffee onthe go at the time. I suppose I’m pretty normal – I don’t have to have acertain mood, or music, or absolute silence. I think very few writers getprecious about their environment or habits. As long as I’ve got the essentials;a little peace and quiet, I’m naked and wearing a rasher of bacon. You know,just the basics.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I knownothing about the book before I start. Well, I know a little. I know theopening and maybe a wee bit about what happens later on. I’ve yet to start abook knowing the ending. So I don’t plan, I write line by line.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Time. I’ve got two small kids, aloving and understanding wife, a full time job and a dog. The hardest part istrying to balance all of those things.Has your life changed since becoming a published author? If so, how?It has changed so much.Financially it’s a different universe. I’ve been able to travel and the bestthing has been meeting other writers. I’ve made a lot of good friends.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?MichaelConnelly, John Connolly, Raymond Chandler, Lee Child, and a host more.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?Reaching For The Ground. Or, to make it sell – The Girl On The Tram, With The Funny Tattoo, In The Red Jumper, Who Dissappeared And Never Came Back.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Writewith desperation.And lastly, why should people read The Defence?TheDefence is my debut novel, it’s about Eddie Flynn, a former con artist turnedstreet-smart New York lawyer. It’s a been a year since Eddie Flynn vowed neverto set foot in a courtroom again. But now he doesn’t have a choice. OlekVolchek, the infamous head of the Russian Mafia in New York, has strapped abomb to Eddie’s back and kidnapped his ten-year-old daughter, Amy. Eddie’s got48 hours to defend Volchek in an impossible murder trial – and win – if hewants to save his daughter. Under media and FBI scrutiny, Eddie must use hisrazor-sharp wit and every con-artist trick in the book to defend his client andensure Amy’s safety. The Defence should appeal to fans of John Grisham, LeeChild and Michael Connelly.About Steve CavanaghSteve Cavanagh was born and raised in Belfast and is a practising lawyer. He holds a certificate in Advanced Advocacy and lectures on various legal subjects (but really he just likes to tell jokes). He is married with two young children. The Defence, has been chosen as one of Amazon's great debuts for 2015, as part of their Amazon Rising Stars programme.

His beloved wife has died, he's unable to write a note of music, and no, he does not want to take up some blasted hobby.Then one day he discovers that his troublesome four-year-old grandson is a piano prodigy. The music returns and Fox is compelled to re-engage with life - and, ultimately, to confront an old family rift.Decades earlier, Fox and his brothers return to Hartgrove Hall after the War, determined to save their once grand home from ruin. But on the last night of 1946, the arrival of beautiful wartime singer Edie Rose tangles the threads of love and duty, which leads to a shattering betrayal.My verdictOnce again, Natasha Solomons has written a beautiful, heartbreaking novel.The Song Collector focuses on the story of composer Harry 'Fox' Fox-Talbot.In the present day, Fox has lost his inner music following the death of his wife, and is struggling to find ways to pass his time. Neither of his daughters has inherited his musical ability, so he is amazed to discover that his troublesome four-year-old grandson is a piano prodigy. As music fills his life again, Fox seeks forgiveness for past mistakes.In the late 1940s, Fox and his brothers return to the decaying family home after the war, determined to restore it to its former glory. Then Fox falls in love with a woman who isn't his to love.The Song Collector pulled at my heartstrings with its passion for music and grief for lost loved ones. The prose flowed seamlessly, with beautiful descriptions of Hartgrove Hall and the surrounding countryside. Natasha Solomons has created believable characters with real emotions - in keeping with all her excellent novels so far.

Her latest book - Beyond the Sea - is being published by Arrow on 16 July 2015. So Melissa, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I’ve always loved books andreading and from being a small child I was always writing - poems, short stories,things like that. I went on to become a lawyer, but in the back of mind therewas always a small voice that kept saying ‘you should write that novel you wantto write’. That voice kept getting louder and louder until I couldn’t ignore itany more. At which point, I went part-time at work and put pen to paper in aserious way.Where do you get your ideas from?The spark of the idea for my first book, The Medici Mirror, actually camefrom reading A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami, one of my favouritenovelists. In that book, the protagonist is holed up alone in a spooky housemiles from anywhere and comes across a dirty old mirror. The atmosphere at thatpoint of the novel was spine tingling - claustrophobic, magical. It gave me theidea of using a darkened mirror and of creating a book of my own which washaunting and mysterious. When I started researching the history of mirrors, thename I kept coming across was Catherine de Medici, who had a vast collection.Not only that, she was a member of the infamous Medici clan - plotters andpoisoners – and had a reputation for involvement with magic and the occult.From there the plot really began to take off.With my second novel, Beyond the Sea, the plot developed from a solitary,yet very clear image I had in my mind – a woman, with white hair, standing on atiny island alone, a lighthouse in the near distance behind her. From thatsingle image, and an obsession with fairy tales and myths of the sea, a novelemerged.Soclearly I tend to start from one image and move outwards from that.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? If so, how?I loved ghost stories, thesupernatural, from being a child but I have vivid memories of feeling acutely frightenedat the same time - fearful of the unknown, of what lurked just at the edge of myvision. As an adult, I’ve found it a rich source of creative inspiration to goback and tap into those childhood fears once again. It’s been a great place forme to occupy, explore and develop from.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Haunting, charged - but I alsolike to keep it simple.Do you have any strange writing habits?Hmm. Ido have the odd dressing gown day – where I’m so desperate to get an idea downbefore it disappears that I find that I’m writing until about 4pm withoutgetting dressed. And a lot of cake gets eaten while the writing is happening –but I’m not sure that’s all that strange. I know a few writers who operate thesame way. I like to think it helps my creative juices flow!Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing to see where it leads you?I don’tplan a novel in a huge amount of detail but I work from a general outlinethat’s specific enough to keep me on track, in theory at least, but looseenough to allow the story to develop in its own way.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Sittingalone, day after day. Sometimes, when the writing isn’t going well and thewords just won’t flow, it can feel like the most isolated, difficult job ever.But on the flip side, when it goes well, there’s no feeling in the world tobeat it.From the blurb, Beyond the Sea seems very different from your first novel, The Medici Mirror (published in 2013). Is this the case?That’s an interesting question.But I think that they’re more similar than perhaps they appear at first glance. The Medici Mirror is part historical,part supernatural love story, part ghost story, moving between the sixteenthcentury court of Catherine de Medici and twenty-first century London whereJohnny, an architect, is renovating an old Victorian shoe factory. It’s aboutthe imprints that are left behind by those who came before.Beyond the Sea, while set in theHebrides, a completely different location, is also a love story with a ghostlytheme, focusing on Freya and her return after the death of her husband and sonto the home they once occupied. There’s also a historical thread runningthrough it in the form of letters written by a Cromwellian sailor despatched tobattle in Scotland in 1653, his own sense of isolation and alienation mirroringFreya’s. Again I’m looking at the past and its echoes in the present. And thesupernatural mirror of the first book is replaced by supernatural forces of thesea in the second book.So I think you’d probably know thebooks were written by the same person.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I lovereading. When I’m not writing I’m reading. My all-time favourite novelist is aJapanese writer called Haruki Murakami. His books are modern, surreal, weirdand wonderful - fish rain down from the sky and cats talk. For the same reasonsI also think Michel Faber is great. But I love older more traditional writersas well, Dickens and the Brontes, as well as modern British writers, RoseTremain, Maggie O’Farrell, David Nicholls.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?That’s impossiblydifficult! So I’m copping out and getting Ian McEwan to help me. One of hisgreat early novels is called ‘The Cement Garden’. We’ve got builders in at themoment and while it’s only been a few weeks the title of that book feelstotally appropriate as a summary of my life right now!What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Keepwriting. The more you write the better it gets. Read lots – you get great ideasand learn a lot simply from seeing how other people write. But inspirationcomes from all sorts of places – magazines, music, films, galleries, evensimply going for a walk, so keep yourself open to everything. And most of allkeep plugging away at it. Don’t get disillusioned – the writing road can be along, hard, solitary one. But keep going. Don’t give up.And lastly, why should people read your book?It’s a spookytale, with a historical bent, chock full of twists and turns. It’s veryevocative, with a keen sense of place, and at its heart is a strong and compellingfemale character that I’ve really enjoyed writing about. I hope people aregoing to like it.About Melissa BaileyMelissa Bailey read English at Oxford, before studying law in London and then pursuing a career in media law. Beyond the Sea is her second novel.

{"title": "The Girl Who Wouldn't Die by Marnie Riches", "date": "Thursday 2 July 2015", "text": "The Girl Who Wouldn't DieBy Marnie RichesPublished by Maze (2 April 2015)Available  as an e-book from Amazon.Publisher's descriptionHE'S WATCHING HER. SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT… YETWhen a bomb explodes at the University of Amsterdam, aspiring criminologist Georgina McKenzie is asked by the police to help flush out the killer.But the bomb is part of a much bigger, more sinister plot that will have the entire city quaking in fear.And the killer has a very special part for George to play...My verdictThis is the first book in a trilogy, with the second instalment due to be published in August 2015 and the third in November 2015.Georgina 'George' McKenzie is a criminology student from Cambridge University who is on a year's placement at the University of Amsterdam. When some of her fellow students are targeted by a bomber, she is called on by the detective in charge of the case to aid the investigation. In South London, Ella Williams-May, who is in trouble with the police, is being forced to become an informant for an investigation into a vicious gang.This thriller is a great debut. You can tell that the author has had direct experience of the two main locations, with lovely descriptions and insights into both Cambridge and Amsterdam. George is a great character - she's feisty, intelligent and curious, but also has a vulnerable side. And she seems to have a habit of getting heavily involved in difficult situations.Although the prologue hooked me in straight away, it did take me a little while to get used to switching between the two threads (George and Ella). But then the story moved at a faster pace and kept me intrigued until the end.I was surprised that the police allowed George to get so involved in the case and visit crime scenes without any qualifications or experience. But this is one of those books where you just have to go along for the ride.I look forward to reading the next in the series."},

But she never thought she would be investigating her own sister's murder.SHE CAN'T TRUST THE POLICE Madison refuses to accept the official line that Abigail's death was an isolated crime. She uncovers evidence that suggests that Abi was the third victim in a series of killings that's been hushed up as part of a major conspiracy.SHE CAN EXPOSE THE TRUTH In a United Staes that has yielded to the People's Republic of China, corruption is rife - the government dictates what the 'truth' is. With her life on the line, Madison must give up the story, or face the consequences…My verdictThe 3rd Woman is the first novel that Jonathan Freedland has written under his own name - his previous five novels were written under the pseudonym Sam Bourne. I really enjoyed all of the Sam Bourne books, so I wasn't surprised to discover that The 3rd Woman is another brilliant fast-paced intelligent thriller.I was hooked from the prologue, which describes the last few living moments of a young woman in Los Angeles. This woman turns out to be Abigail Webb, the younger sister of journalist Madison 'Maddy' Webb. The police maintain that Abigail died of an accidental heroin dose, but Maddy insists that her sister's death was completely out of character. Her investigations reveal that her sister could be the 3rd victim of a serial killer, as another two women have died in very similar circumstances. The 3rd Woman is filled with suspense and intrigue, with short snappy chapters that keep the book moving at a fast pace. I thought that the underlying political background was fascinating. Imagine that the USA is no longer a top world power, now dependent on Chinese finances; corruption is rife, the Chinese control the ports and smog fills the air.I was intrigued right until the last page. As Maddy continues her investigations, she realises that she is being watched, leading to a deadly cat and mouse game. She is feisty and determined, but her vulnerable side emerges when it becomes clear that those closest to her may be in danger too. As the police struggle to find answers, Maddy wonders whether a major conspiracy could be at work.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Lovereading in exchange for an honest review.To celebrate the launch of BritCrime’s first free online crime fiction festival, 11-13 July, I have teamed up with BritCrime authors to give away one fabulous prize.You could win a gift bundle of ten print books, including new releases by Colette McBeth and Sarah Hilary, and MJ McGrath’s Gold Dagger longlisted White Heat.

{"title": "Off-the-shelf book reviews - six months on", "date": "Tuesday 30 June 2015", "text": "When I set up my book reviews blog on 30th December 2014, I had no idea what was in store.Six months on, I have had over 18,500 page views, read some outstanding books, taken part in some great blog tours, interviewed many brilliant authors and met (in the virtual and real worlds) some amazing bloggers/reviewers, authors, publicists and publishers. I have discovered a whole new world and a whole network of people with a passion for books and reading.When I'm not working as a freelance health journalist/editor, I'm reading and reviewing fiction (even though I should really be writing more of my own book - more of that later). According to my 2015 Goodreads challenge, I have read 124 books this year so far (it's probably closer to 130, as I still have a few more reviews to add). This is already more books than I read for the 2014 Goodreads challenge.I have always loved reading and immersing myself in fictional worlds. As a child, I longed to be a detective, spy or explorer. I wanted to turn the Secret Seven into the Secret Eight. I dreamed of being Nancy Drew. I wanted the Hardy Boys to be my brothers. And I imagined myself to be part of the Willard Price adventures.According to my parents, I was constantly glued to a book, particularly at the dinner table (which was a common bone of contention in our household). I was often found writing and illustrating stories too. My parents aren't surprised that I have made a career out of working with words. Even now, I have a book or Kindle with me whenever I leave the house and I take my 'Kindle' for a walk on most weekdays.When I reached my teens, I worked my way through my dad's Alistair Maclean and Desmond Begley novels, before discovering Stephen King and eventually crime thrillers. By then, I wanted to write the books, rather than be a part of them. I bought a whole series of books from the USA on writing about forensics and crime.Although I always enjoyed English at school, I loved the sciences too, which is why I decided to embark on a Biomedical Science degree, with the intention of obtaining a PhD in Forensic Science. The plan was that I would eventually use my forensics knowledge to become a crime fiction author one day (or at least try to do so).But in my final year of university, my love for journalism overcame my love for science. This led to a Masters in Science Communication and working for consumer and pharmacy magazines, writing about health. Over the years, I have also edited health books, magazines and websites. My non-fiction book on children's allergies was first published in 2009 (then 2013).Starting this book blog has been an amazing experience and I wish I had discovered the joys of book blogging years ago. I am a very fast reader and usually manage to read up to four books a week (in addition to working virtually full time from home).As I have already mentioned, over the last six months I have met a diverse range of people, all with one thing in common - a love of reading. In recent weeks, I have been to the Killer Women launch, the book launch of The Versions Of Us and the Crime in the Court event at Goldsboro Books.Friends and family are astonished to discover that book bloggers don't get paid. After all, running a book blog can be just as time consuming as paid work - from reading the books and writing reviews to fitting in blog tours and arranging and typing up author interviews. But I love every minute of it.(Obviously though, if any publication wants to pay me to write reviews or author interviews, or any authors/publishers want to pay me to edit their books, I won't say no! It's just a side-step from health really...)My ultimate aim remains, however, to complete a novel of my own, even if I never attempt to get it published. I have started several books over the years. Since December, I have written over 25,000 words of a historical fiction novel, loosely based on the story of a great-uncle of mine during WW2. But I struggle to find the time to fit writing into my life, with family, work and reading/reviewing.There's a possibility that this will change in November, when I plan to put my life on hold (a little) while I take part in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month). I thank the lovely Elizabeth Haynes for persuading me to sign up. I have another book idea buzzing around in my head, and I'm going to focus on this for those 30 days (although I can't avoid work completely during that time, as I still have bills to pay).Thanks to everyone who has helped me to build up my blog over the last six months. There are several book bloggers in particular who give me brilliant advice and support. I'm not going to mention specific names, as I'm sure I'll end up missing someone out. But hopefully you all know who you are.I look forward to the next six months and beyond - sharing my time and thoughts with so many other book lovers."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Mark Edwards - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Monday 29 June 2015", "text": "I am delighted that MARK EDWARDS is joining me on my blog today, as part of the Blog Tour for his latest book. Mark 's latest book - Follow You Home - is published by Thomas & Mercer on 30 June 2015. So Mark, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?Follow You Home came from a conversation with my editor. Both The Magpies and Because She Loves Me, my previous novels, were inspired by something that happened to me: living above nightmare neighbours and having a jealous girlfriend. My editor jokily asked me what other terrible experiences I'd had, which made me think back to something that happened to me when I was 20. My then-girlfriend and I went inter-railing around Europe but were robbed on a night train on our second day and stranded in southern France. This led to me thinking about the worst thing that could have happened. So Follow You Home starts with a couple setting off on a night train in a foreign country and it all goes horribly wrong...Where do your ideas come from?As above, the spark always comes from something difficult or stressful that has happened to me. Then I try to make it as dark as possible, to put my characters in really difficult situations. I pick up ideas, too, from news stories or TV shows - for example, the next Voss and Edwards book was inspired by a documentary about crazy One Direction fans!Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Apart from the above, everything that happens to me influences my writing. Whether it's writing about relationships, the way couples interact for example, or work situations. I don't go around with a notepad writing down people's conversations, although people sometimes suspect I lurk around doing this. But I absorb everything that goes on around me, as I am sure all writers do.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?I write psychological thrillers in which scary things happen to ordinary people.Do you have any strange writing habits?Yes, I have a trained parrot who does all my typing… I recite the words and he skitters around the keyboard, tapping it out.But seriously… I don't know if it's strange but I do most of my writing in cafés and at my local gym, surrounded by people and noise. I do this because I have small children at home and my office was turned into a nursery when our third child came along. but I now find it very hard to write when it's quiet.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I used to be a 100% pantser, making it up as I went along, but I now try to plot in advance. I tend to plot out the first part, and then start writing, extending the plot and figuring it out as I go along. This technique is, I think, called the 'driving in the dark' technique. You can see what your car headlights reveal but, beyond that, everything is shrouded in darkness. This makes writing more exciting.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Two things. The biggest one is plotting. When you write psychological thrillers, readers expect twists and turns, misdirection and shocks. Coming up with these twists, making it all work, dropping in enough clues without giving it all away… that's what makes it hard. The second thing is, now that I'm on my 11th novel, is keeping it fresh. Not repeating things. Not repeating things.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Yes! Mistrust any author who doesn't read. In fact, if I found out an author doesn't read, I would instantly think their books must be rubbish - because the words you read provide fuel for your own writing. And why would you want to be a writer if you don't love books? My favourite authors are Donna Tartt, Bret Easton Ellis, Mo Hayder, Peter James, Sarah Lotz, Ira Levin, Paula Daly and tons of other crime and psychological thriller writers. Far too many to list here.As well as writing solo, you also collaborate with Louise Voss. Has writing with Louise affected the way you write or research your own books? If so, how?It hasn't really affected how I research books, although the books with Louise do require more research as they are police procedurals. Co-writing is great as it gives you a sense of freedom. I write something, send it to Louise, she gives me instant feedback… I think it makes us both more comfortable about taking risks.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'Mark My Words'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Being a writer is so stressful that you have to really, really want it and be unable to stop yourself doing it. So only start writing if it's your passion and you believe that you have something original and interesting to say.And lastly, why should people read Follow You Home?Follow You Home is scary and exciting. It starts out like the Blair Witch Project and ends up like an action-packed Simon Kernick thriller. And I guarantee you won't guess the final twist. Don't just take my word for it. It's had rave reviews from writers including Angela Marsons, Clare Mackintosh and CL Taylor, who says: 'Twisty, turn and downright creepy in places, Mark Edwards has, yet again, produced an unputdownable psychological thriller. He is a master at creating a tangled web of secrets, lies and red herrings so cleverly constructed that I was kept guessing all the way through.About Mark EdwardsMark Edwards writes psychological thrillers. His first solo novel, The Magpies, topped the Kindle chart in the UK. What You Wish For followed in March 2014 and Because She Loves Me was published in September 2014.

A moment's carelessness, a tragic accident - and two children are dead. Yours.Living in a small island community, you can't escape the woman who destroyed your life. Each chance encounter is an agonising reminder of what you've lost - your family, your future, your sanity.How long before revenge becomes irresistible?With no reason to go on living, why shouldn't you turn your darkest thoughts into deeds?So now, what's the worst thing you can do to your best friend?My verdictLittle Black Lies is filled with secrets, lies, betrayal, suspense and intrigue. I read it in just a few hours, yet the story lingered in my mind for some time afterwards. It's chilling, nail-biting and breath-holding writing at its best.Three years after the tragic death of her two sons, Catrin is still struggling to cope with her grief. Her childhood friend Rachel, who was responsible for the accident, is no longer part of Catrin's life. When a child goes missing and the search begins, Catrin's memories haunt her and her hatred of Rachel grows and grows.The Falklands provide the perfect location for this story - a chilling remote island setting. In such a small community, everyone knows each other. When tragedy strikes, it's far more difficult to forget and move on if the people involved don't move away. In Little Black Lies, Rachel still lives close by and has a family of her own, while Catrin's suffering continues.Not only is this book a roller coaster read, filled with twists and turns, but it's very well-researched, especially the local wildlife and history of the Falklands community. The book is set in the mid-1990s, which is only 12 years after the Falklands War. The War is still very raw in the minds of the island residents, which adds to the story's background and gripping atmosphere.Sharon Bolton has been one of my favourite authors for years, and I think that Little Black Lies may be her best standalone novel yet. I held my breath for most of the last third of the book. There were so many red herrings that I had no idea which way the plot was going to go. I was drained and exhausted by the final page.I recommend this book to anyone who loves well-researched chilling thrillers that leave you with goosebumps.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow You HomeBy Mark EdwardsPublished by Thomas & Mercer (30 June 2015)ISBN: 978-1503944374Publisher's descriptionIt was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime, a final adventure before settling down.After a perfect start, Daniel and Laura's travels end abruptly when they are thrown off a night train in the middle of nowhere.

But as they try to fit back into their old lives, it becomes clear that their nightmare is just beginning...My verdictFollow You Home is the story of Laura and Daniel, who are on the trip of a lifetime, backpacking around Europe, before they settle down and have children. After they are thrown off a train in Romania one night, they have a horrific experience. Stunned and emotionally scarred, they make a pact that they will never mention it again - not even to each other. But the past doesn't always stay hidden, and a series of accidents and events suggests that someone is out to get them.Mark Edwards has the knack of taking normal people and putting them into difficult situations to see how they would cope. After Romania, Daniel tries to get on with his life, but Laura struggles to do so, leading to a downward spiral in her physical and mental health. Their relationship breaks apart too - but can they rely on each other when their lives may be in danger?Follow You Home keeps you guessing right until the end, when you finally discover what Laura and Daniel actually saw that night in Romania. This easy-to-read thriller is creepy and filled with suspense, various dodgy characters and twists and turns.

Miraculously, she survived. A year later, her family ask psychologist Alice Quentin to re-examine the case.But then an elderly priest is attacked in Battersea, his body washed up at Westminster Pier. An ancient glass bead is tied to his wrist.The river has always demanded sacrifices, and now it seems a killer believes it's calling out for more.Alice is certain that Jude and her family are hiding something, but unless she can persuade them to share what they know, more victims will drown...My verdictYet again Kate Rhodes has written an excellent atmospheric crime thriller. I loved her last Alice Quentin book - The Winter Foundlings - and couldn't wait to read this one too. Although River of Souls is part of a series, it can easily be read as a standalone, as it includes enough background information about the characters so that you don't get lost but no spoilers about previous books.River of Souls incorporates a chilling plot filled with suspense, tragedy, grief and family secrets. The crimes are savage ones, involving horrific mutilations, and psychologist Alice Quentin is called in to assist the investigation. I love that this series is set in London, around the Thames in this case, as I could relate to many of the settings and landmarks. The underlying historical theme was fascinating too.All of the characters are very 'real'. Alice Quentin, in particular, is a brilliant and very likeable protagonist. She's a tough and independent psychologist, but also warm and devoted to helping people as part of her job. Although she has family issues to deal with (her mother's physical health and brother's mental health), she doesn't let these impinge on her working life.This is a well-researched page-turner, a real 'can't put it down' book - and I suggest you read it to find out how brilliant it is!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour:"},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Rebecca Pugh - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Wednesday 24 June 2015", "text": "I am delighted that REBECCA PUGH is joining me on my blog today, as part of the Blog Tour for her book - Return to Bluebell Hill - which was published by Carina on 18 June 2015. So Rebecca, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I don’t think it wasanything in particular that sparked the idea. I suppose, in a way, it hadalways been there, right at the very back of my mind. I’ve always been an avid reader and I’ve always been surrounded bybooks. I never thought I’d be able to write anything that compared to the booksI’d read. I have numerous stories saved on my laptop that I twiddled andtweaked, but never took seriously. Returnto Bluebell Hill was the first story I managed to complete. It meantsomething to me, became extra-special, and I cared about my charactersimmeasurably. The decision to submit my manuscript to Carina bounced about inmy mind for a while, until I finally took that step. Not in a million years didI ever, ever, ever expect anything tocome from it. It’s safe to say that my jaw hit the floor when I received ‘thecall’…Where did the idea for Return to Bluebell Hill come from?Completely from my imagination. I’ve always found bluebells and themyths/stories behind them enchanting, mainly because I have a very whimsicalmind that clings to anything slightly romantic and fairy-tale like.  I’m a complete sucker for romance, too, butI’m also a huge family girl. I think I included a smattering of the things thatI love in Return to Bluebell Hill.Whether I liked it or not, they would have crept out of me and into the bookanyway. It’s just how my mind works.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?A sprinkle ofcosiness with a dash of magic!Do you have any strange writing habits?I know that I candefinitely get carried away with the descriptions of settings when writing, somuch so that the whole book could be dedicated to the place where my storiesare set! ;) I also find it hard to get started without first having a nice cupof coffee. I’ll sometimes sit with the TV on but switched onto mute, no ideawhy. And I really can’t cope with interruptions once I’m really in the swing ofthings!Did you plot out the whole book before you started or just started writing to see where it would lead you?I’m not organised inthe slightest, meaning when an idea comes to me, I much prefer to tap awayrather than make notes etc. I’ve tried, don’t get me wrong, to organise myselfand make things easier so that I don’t hit that black hole later on, allbecause I didn’t make a plan, but it just doesn’t work for me. Once I have anidea, I just have to get it out andget involved in it. I guess every writer is different, and chaotic bursts ofinspiration are what work best for me!What have you found to be the hardest part of your writing?Ensuring the pace ofmy story is enough to keep readers turning the pages. If you’ve read any of thebook reviews on Becca’s Books, you’ll see that sometimes, I will ramble on andon and on, and I think I can end up doing this when writing, too. As Imentioned above in the question about writing habits, I get seriously carriedaway when it comes to descriptions… What should probably be a quick mention caneasily turn into a three-paragraph long description of some trees. Oops!Has your life changed since getting your publishing deal? If so, how?It’s definitely moreexciting! That’s not to say I didn’t love my life beforehand. I’m incrediblyblessed to have such wonderful and loving people surrounding me. I had andstill have everything that I need and I’ve never expected to have more thanthat, because I know that people have less. Since being offered my publishingdeal, I feel like I’ve found my purpose, does that sound ridiculous? All of asudden, things that I never dreamt of happening, even having this chat withyou, are happening, and it’s completely surreal. I’d also like to say thatbeing offered my publishing deal has reinforced the fact that dreams do come true. I couldn’t wait totell my younger brothers and sisters about it because I wanted them to knowthat you can achieve your dreams inlife. I hope that’s what they think, that their big sister wasn’t afraid to goafter what she wanted, so they won’t be afraid either. Finally, my publishingdeal has made me realise that maybe, my writing isn’t so bad after all… It’supped my confidence and I feel brave and capable. I going at my writing harderthan ever and I absolutely LOVE IT!You regularly review books on your own blog. Do you think your love of reading and reviewing has helped with your writing?Yes, definitely! I100% believe that my love of reading has built the foundations for what I hopewill become a writing ‘career’. I’ve read so many books, seen the way otherauthors write and create their stories, and it’s solidified it in my head. Ithink the books that I’ve read have paved the way to becoming an author myself.Who are your favourite authors?Oh, wow. How longhave you got? I have nearly all of Jill Mansell’s books because I adore herstyle so much. I love Miranda Dickinson, Sophie Kinsella, Holly Martin, RebeccaRaisin, Rosanna Ley is another firm favourite. But then, I also love StephenKing for his incredible imagination. I have a bit of a ‘thing’ for R.L. Stine’sGoosebumps books, too. Honestly, this list doesn’t even touch the surface.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?This is a fabulousquestion! I think I’d call it, ‘The GirlWho Did,’ and it would be about having the courage to go after what youwant, no matter how unachievable you may think it is at the time.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Same as above, Ireckon! I cannot even begin to tell you how important I think it is to just try. No matter who you are, where you’refrom, what you do for a living, whether you drink coffee or tea, have a dog ora cat, are ambitious or not, do it. Just bloody DO IT! I saw a quote once, andI can’t for the life of me think who said it now, but it went something alongthe lines of this, ‘It’s not fear of failure that holds us back. It’s fear ofhow big our success might turn out to be.’ I love it, because it’s true, for meanyway. The fear of actually having to step out and bring some attention tomyself scared me much more than the idea of failing. That’s not to say that Ididn’t think I would fail, because I most definitely did. But if I failed, lifewould go on as normal and at least I could say that I’d tried. If I succeeded, it wouldn’t.And lastly, why should people read your book?I guess my debut Return to Bluebell Hill will make orbreak me. It will either be the beginning of a much dreamt-about career inwriting, or the end of a very quick burst of excitement! ;) I sincerely hopethat it’s the former. Return to Bluebell Hill is the only story out of about578529583 that made it to the finish line. To see it make it past that line?Well… *exhales shakily* It’ll be a little bit crazy. Okay, A LOT crazy.About Rebecca PughRebecca Pugh grew up in the green county of Shropshire, with a mind full of fairy-tales and happy endings.

It's the perfect book to escape into while soaking up the summer sun, whether here in the UK or abroad.After the sudden deaths of both of her parents, Jessica is forced to journey home from London to Bluebell Hill, having escaped from there so many years ago. She returns to Bluebell House, her childhood home, with her old nanny Esme providing the support she needs as she packs up her parents' possessions.Jessica has to make a decision about whether she should now cut ties with her roots completely or forgive and forget past mistakes. Meeting Reuben, the handsome, sexy gardener at Bluebell House, makes the decision to leave even harder, even though she wonders whether returning to her life in London may be just what she needs.Return to Bluebell Hill is a really easy read. I loved the descriptions of Bluebell House and the country village setting, and I could picture the scenery in my mind. Jessica, Reuben and Esme felt very 'real' and really brought the book to life. Jessica is a sweet character filled with emotions, unsure about where her future lies. This isn't just a book of romance, as it also contains suspense and intrigue as Jessica gradually uncovers the secrets of Bluebell Hill and her family's past.This is a great debut, an amazing achievement for Rebecca Pugh, who is just 22. I would have liked to know a bit more about how Jessica's parents died, as the book concentrated more on Jessica's relationship with her family and Bluebell House. Maybe there's an opportunity for a follow up book one day!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Mel Sherratt", "date": "Tuesday 23 June 2015", "text": "I am delighted that MEL SHERRATT is joining me on my blog today. Mel's latest book - Only the Brave - was published by Thomas & Mercer on 26 May 2015. So Mel, what inspired you to write crime fiction in the first place?I like writing about underdogs, often showing their goodsides as well as their mean streaks – plus writing about situations thatescalate out of control. I also like a sense of justice, the knowledge thateither someone is caught for committing a crime or someone is getting help tomove on and improve his or her life.Where do your ideas come from?Everywhere - a song title or lyric, a newspaper report, a TVprogram or a news bulletin.  A comment onsocial media. If I’m ever stuck for ideas for The Estate Series, for example, Ican pick up a women’s magazine and find plot lines galore.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?I think every writer’s personal experience influences theirwriting. One of the main themes in a lot of my books comes from the sense offeeling abandoned. My parents divorced when I was a child and I think thisstems from memories of my childhood. Also working as a housing officer for the local authorityfor eight years meant that I saw some terrible situations, some you would thinkwould be fiction rather than fact. This background knowledge was a greatstarting point for ideas to ferment.  Awriter mostly twists reality with the words ‘what if.’Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Gritty, raw, emotional and passionate. And lots of shortsentences.Do you have any strange writing habits?Erm – none that I know of.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I plot a lot of it, having a vague beginning, middle andend. I create the characters and then I start writing, letting the main onesdictate to a certain extent. If I go off the original plan, I always tend tocome back to the same ending.Your books obviously involve in-depth research. What's the most interesting place you have visited for one of your books? And what's the strangest? Have you visited anywhere particularly frightening?I don’t actually do a lot of research,except around any social issues that I might touch on, and for that, I researchon the Internet or read a book on a particular subject, or a case study. I haven’t been to any strange places, as mybooks are either set in my hometown of Stoke-on-Trent or in a fictional town(The Estate Series).  The weirdest onewas visiting the police station where my detective sergeant, Allie Shenton, isbased. I could have sworn I saw her walking down the corridor towards her desk.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Switching off. It’s such a fascinating job - there is alwayssomething to learn, to read, to research.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I like crime fiction, psychological thrillers and women’sfiction (although I don’t particularly like that phrase – there’s no such thingas men’s fiction.) I have a few favourite authors whose books I read as soon asthey come out, such as C L Taylor, Elizabeth Haynes, Martina Cole and KimberleyChambers.  For women’s fiction, it’s RowanColeman, Lisa Jewell and Lucy Diamond. I read a lot of books to provide quotesfor too. There is a mass of talent out there.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?My editor calls me Ms Brit Grit-Lit so it would have to besomething along those lines. Something like 'Everyone likes an Underdog'. Now,I’m sniggering.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Advice I give to any aspiring writer is to find what is bestfor them. We all go on different journeys to achieve our goals – and all ourgoals are different. Self-publishing gave me some massive opportunities but Iwas hard at it for years before that. What works for one might not necessarilywork for you, but keep at it. Experiment, have fun, and it will show in yourwork.And lastly, why should people read your latest book?Because Only the Brave would dare miss out…About Mel SherrattMet Sherratt writes police procedurals, psychological suspense and fiction with a punch - or grit-lit, as she calls it. She has related three psychological thrillers in a series, The Estate, and Watching Over You, a dark, erotic thriller. More recently, she has made her first novel, Taunting the Dead, into the first of a series, with Follow the Leader and Only the Brave, books 2 and 3 respectively, both published this year.Find Mel Sherratt on her official Facebook page and follow Mel on Twitter - @writermelsOnly the BravePublished by Thomas & Mercer (26 May 2015)Synopsis: When one of the notorious Johnson brothers is murdered and a bag of money goes missing, a deadly game of cat and mouse is set in motion.DS Allie Shenton and her team are called in to catch the killer, but the suspects are double-crossing each other and Allie has little time to untangle the web of lies.As she delves deeper into the case, things take a personal turn when Allie realises she is being stalked b the very same person who attacked her sister seventeen years ago and left her for dead.Read my review hereOnly the BraveBy Mel SherrattPublished by Thomas & Mercer (26 May 2015)ISBN: 978-1477830628Publisher's descriptionWhen one of the notorious Johnson brothers is murdered and a bag of money goes missing, a deadly game of cat and mouse is set in motion.DS Allie Shenton and her team are called in to catch the killer, but the suspects are double-crossing each other and Allie has little time to untangle the web of lies.As she delves deeper into the case, things take a personal turn when Allie realises she is being stalked by the very same person who attacked her sister 17 years ago and left her for dead.My verdictOnly the Brave is Mel Sherratt's third DS Allie Shenton book. Although this book could be read as a standalone, I suggest reading this series in order. In Only the Brave, characters return from the previous books and the background story about Allie's past continues.This book is about crime, dodgy dealings, deception and, ultimately, money. When a man is stabbed to death, the police begin their search for the murderer, but none of the people involved are forthcoming with their information. Meanwhile, money that the dead man was carrying has gone missing, and the rightful owner is determined to find it.Allie Shenton is a tough cookie and always gets the results, but in Only The Brave you get to see her more vulnerable side (a nice contrast against the hard characters of the crime world). Behind the scenes, her life is in turmoil. Her sister Karen, who was left for dead in an attack 17 years earlier, is now seriously ill and Allie has a difficult decision looming. She is also receiving threats from her sister's attacker, who has suddenly appeared on the scene.Only the Brave moves at a steady pace, with the whole story taking place over just 48 hours. I found it to be a little rushed at the very end, but comes to a satisfying conclusion. I am intrigued to see what happens to Allie next.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "The Day We Disappeared by Lucy Robinson", "date": "Monday 22 June 2015", "text": "The Day We DisappearedBy Lucy RobinsonPublished by Michael Joseph (9 April 2015)ISBN: 978-1405911603Publisher's descriptionIt's springtime in London and everything is about to change for Annie Mulholland. From the moment she meets Stephen Flint, things seem too good to be true as Annie abandons her customary cautiousness for a wild love affair.In Somerset, Kate Brady is starting a new job. Fresh air, new faces and good old-fashioned hard work is just what she needs to put everything that happened in Dublin behind her.But what are these two old friends hiding, and how how long can they run from the secrets of their past before they come crashing into their futures?My verdictThe Day We Disappeared is sad, funny and keeps you guessing. It's a brilliantly written book with a clever plot, fast pace and intrigue. It's a combination of love story and psychological thriller.There are two parallel stories - Annie in London and Kate in Somerset. The chapters alternate between the two women, each one falling for her handsome boss. Kate is clearly running away or hiding from something, but is gradually making friends and building a new life for herself. Annie has a tragic past, which is clear from the outset, but has a great network of friends to rely on and keep her focused.It took me a couple of chapters to get into the book. It reads like chick lit, which is no bad thing, but chick lit has to be very well written to keep me reading all the way through. In this case, I was sucked into the story soon enough, with its humour, romance and suspense. Then there's the sudden twist (which I have to admit, I had already suspected but not completely sussed out).The Day We Disappeared is an excellent choice for fans of I Let You Go by Clare Mackintosh. It's very easy to get so engrossed in the story that you forget the time - and then to shout OMG when the twist arrives.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Erica James", "date": "Friday 19 June 2015", "text": "I am delighted that ERICA JAMES is joining me on my blog today. Erica's latest book - The Dandelion Years - was published in paperback by Orion on 18 June 2015.So Erica, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?It was a love of reading that triggered the thought that maybe it might be rather fun to tell a story of my own. I was proved right!Where do your ideas come from?As with most authors, ideas come from all sorts of places and often in the most unlikely. Occasionally an idea will come to me following a conversation with somebody, it could even be something as simple as a particular word used that could set off a thought process. With The Dandelion Years, it was reading something about Bletchley Park that set me off.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?I think I can only really write about something that has an emotional resonance for me, I need to be able to 'feel' the situation I'm going to write about, it's about empathy. Many times in my novels I've dug down deep to explore and use my own emotions; it's frequently been a very cathartic experience.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?I'm a storyteller.Do you have any strange writing habits?Oh, where to start! My first novel was published in 1996 and ever since I've written in the same way, printing chapters off as I go along and putting them into a red file - no other colour would do. I have my 'magic' pens and pencils that nobody else is allowed to touch, I drink from 'magic' bone china mugs (again nobody else is allowed to use them) and I have everything set out on my desk in the same way for each book. Basically nothing must change or the magic will leave me. Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I've never plotted a book before, I just go where the characters take me. When I started work on The Dandelion Years I had no idea I was going to write Jacob's character in the first person, but suddenly that was how he wanted his story to be told. Who was I to disagree?What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Holding my nerve when the doubts kick in, as they always do. I've never written a book that hasn't given me cause to doubt that I'm writing a story people will want to read. I call it the Wobble Factor and there's nothing else for it but to keep going in the hope it will pass.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?My reading taste has changed quite a bit over the years and I find that I'm reading more and more books written by men. Daniel Silva is a thriller writer I've recently discovered, but my favourite book of the year so far, and a book I'd been meaning to read for a very long time, is E.F. Benson's Mapp & Lucia. The wait was worth it; it's a gloriously funny novel.Your latest book The Dandelion Years prompted me to visit Bletchley Park (the day after I finished your book, in fact). What's the most interesting place that you have visited for your books? And what's the strangest?I suppose Venice and Lake Como are at the top end of the spectrum when it comes to the most interesting places to visit for my novels, but strangest… well, I can't think of anything that fits that particular bill.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'She Could Have Done Better'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Never ever rubbish a book you've just read and claim you can do better. Nothing annoys me more than hearing the kind of arrogance from aspiring authors.And lastly, why should people read The Dandelion Years?Oh lawks, I'm a hopeless self-promoter, so practically the latest person to urge anyone to read anything I've written. But if you had a gun to my head, I'd say The Dandelion Years is a bargain with two stories for the price of one - Saskia's story as a book restorer in contemporary Suffolk, and Jacob's story set during WWII at Bletchley Park. How does that sound?About Erica JamesWith an insatiable appetite for other people's business, Erica James will readily strike up conversation with strangers in the hope of unearthing a useful gem for her writing. She finds it the best way to write authentic characters for her novels, although her two grown-up sons claim they will never recover from a childhood spent in a perpetual state of embarrassment at their mother's compulsion. The author of many bestselling novels, including Gardens of Delight, which won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award, and her recent Sunday Times top ten bestsellers, Summer at the Lake and the The Dandelion Years, Erica now divides her time between Suffolk and Lake Como in Italy, where she strikes up conversation with unsuspecting Italians.Find Erica James on her website and follow Erica on Twitter - @TheEricaJamesThe Dandelion YearsPublished in paperback by Orion (18 June 2015)Synopsis: Ashcombe was the most beautiful house Saskia had every seen as a little girl. A rambling pink cottage on the edge of the Suffolk village of Melbury Green, its enchanting garden provided a fairy-tale playground of seclusion, a perfect sanctuary to hide from the tragedy which shattered her childhood.Now as an adult, Saskia is still living at Ashcombe and as a book restorer devotes her days tending to the broken, battered books that find their way to her, daydreaming about the people who had once turned their pages. When she discovers a notebook carefully concealed in an old Bible - and realising someone has gone to a great deal of trouble to hide a story of their own - Saskia finds herself drawn into a heart-rending tale of wartime love...The Dandelion Years is one of my favourite books of 2015 so far.

{"title": "The Edge of Dark by Pamela Hartshorne", "date": "Friday 19 June 2015", "text": "The Edge of DarkBy Pamela HartshornePublished by Pan Macmillan (Paperback - 12 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1447249559Publisher's descriptionBe careful what you wish for. Jane believes in keeping her promises, but a deathbed vow sets her on a twisting path of deceit and joy that takes her from the dark secrets of Holmwood House in York to the sign of the golden lily in London's Mincing Lane. Getting what you want, Jane discovers, comes at a price. For the child that she longed for, the child she promised to love and to keep safe, turns out to be a darker spirit than she could ever have imagined.Over four centuries later, Roz Acclam remembers nothing of the fire that killed her family - or of the brother who set it. Trying on a beautiful Elizabethan necklace found in the newly restored Holmwood House triggers disturbing memories of the past at last - but the past Roz remembers is not her own...My verdictWow, The Edge of Dark is a brilliant supernatural novel that left me all 'tingly'.This is the story of two women: Roz in the present day and Jane in the 16th century. Roz's family died tragically in a fire in York when she was just five years old. She went to live with her aunt and, not remembering anything about the tragedy, was told that all of her family had died in a car accident.When Roz starts working at Holmwood House in York, she hopes that some of her memories will return. But the flashbacks she experiences are not her own - she appears to be living another woman's life during these visions. Roz doesn't know whether she's being haunted by Jane or just losing her mind.I loved the time-slip aspect of this novel. Pamela Hartshorne very cleverly switches between the two time periods, seamlessly weaving them together. The two women's stories run parallel to one another and, although they are born over 400 years apart, there are several similarities between them. I also found the historical background fascinating, reading about women's lives in Tudor times.The Edge of Dark had been sitting in my 'To Be Read' pile for a while, and I now wish that I had picked it up earlier. It was very difficult to put down and I raced through the last few chapters to find out what happened at the end. I recommend this book to anyone who loves novels set in the Tudor period or historical fiction with a supernatural twist.I read the hardback version, but both the hardback and paperback books have beautiful covers (which is why I have included both of them with my review).I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "You, Me & People by Fionnuala Kearney", "date": "Thursday 18 June 2015", "text": "You, Me & Other PeopleBy Fionnuala KearneyPublished by Harper Collins UK (18 June 2015)ISBN: 978-0007593989Publisher's descriptionThey say every family has skeletons in their closet…But what happens when you open the door and they won't stop tumbling out?For Adam and Beth, the first secret wasn't the last, it was just the beginning.You think you can imagine the worst thing that could happen to your family, but there are some secrets that change everything.And then the question is, how can you piece together a future when your past is being rewritten?My verdictI loved this book from start to finish and couldn't put it down. You, Me & Other People is a thought-provoking look at the breakdown of a marriage and the costs of infidelity.  The story is filled with gentle humour as well as sadness as the story unfolds.Fionnuala Kearney is not just a gifted storyteller but fleshes out her characters so well that they come to life. The chapters alternate between the viewpoints of Beth and Adam, which means you get to hear both sides of the story. I felt like I knew these two people personally by the end of the book. It's the little details that make them so realistic and believable - their likes and dislikes, their mannerisms etc.At the beginning of the story, Beth finds out that her husband Adam has cheated on her for the second time. But this is only the top layer of his deception. As the story progresses, Beth's character grows and strengthens, dealing with whatever secrets are thrown her way.  Little snippets of information tease the reader and keep the story flowing. The secrets keep on coming, with layer after layer peeled away until the final reveal of all.This is an amazing debut, and I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted that FREDRIK BACKMAN is joining me on my blog today. Fredrik's latest book - My Grandmother Sends Her Regards & Apologises - was published by Sceptre Books on 4 June 2015. So Fredrik, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I'm not really a person who gets ‘inspired’,I'm more of a person who ‘steals stuff’. A man called Ove literally started outwith me standing in line at an Apple Store, behind a man in his prime years,who held an iPad in his hands and demanded to be told if this was a computer ornot. The clerk, who as they always tend to be at Apple Stores was about 12years old, couldn't quite hide his frustration. As the argument got out of hand,I stood there thinking ‘this would be a great first chapter of a novel’. Sosomewhere in Stockholm there is probably still a very angry man with an iPad,roaming the streets looking to hunt me down for royalties.Where do your ideas come from?I would say a combination of havinga lot of free time and not having many friends as a child. My mother alsoclaims it could have something to do with me eating candles when I was aboutfour. Apparently it's bad for your brain or whatever. But I don't know where doany ideas come from? I think a lot, and I'm pretty bad at talking to people.This is my way of communicating.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing and characters? And if so, how?I think only a very select fewwriters, who are the geniuses of each generation, can write fiction that istotally separate from themselves. Most of us are, of course, not geniuses. Mostof us, and me in particular, will never even come close, so we have to tellstories that are close to ourselves. We have to pour all our own trials andtribulations into each of our characters and feel everything that they felt andjust do our very best to make them as real as possible. So to the question ‘ifso, how?’, I answer ‘in every possible way’. Most stories are the sum of theexperiences of the person trying to tell them. I can tell you a joke right nowabout two drunks in a boat, and tell you the same joke in 25 years. It might bea lot funnier then just because I will tell it differently when I'm 59 thanwhen I'm 34. And you might hear it differently. Experience changes everythingwe do. Especially, I think, the way we tell stories.Both of your books are funny, moving and heart-warming. What makes you laugh and what makes you cry?Fun things and sad things. I havelearned not to try to be intellectual about comedy and grief. When you laughyou laugh, when you cry you cry, I have no idea how that works but I'm prettysure that if I don't do it when I write no one who reads it ever will either.Sometimes people ask me questions with the belief that I somehow know how towrite something ‘commercially’ just because I sold a couple of books, but Ireally have no clue. It just so happens that a lot of the things I like arethings that a couple of other people like as well. That's not really answeringyour question, is it? Sorry.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?A writer who never uses 10 words ifhe can use 12.Do you have any strange writing habits?Before I can sit down and write eachmorning, I have to throw a guitar, a can of conserved pineapples and threemonkeys (any sort of monkey, I'm not picky) into a volcano. It's just a thing.But other than that: Nothing at all. Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?Both. To ‘plot out’ is what I wouldcall ‘thinking’. And a book is thoughts and words. I don't know how to doanything at all with just one of them. But I guess this falls in line with menot being a great writer, technically. I think there are a lot of astoundingwriters who possess a great language and can just sit down and jam with theirsentences like a musician, but I'm not nearly as good as that. So I think a lotbefore I start writing. But then of course a novel takes several months or evenyears to finish, and if you don't have a single NEW idea during all that timeyou are in desperate need of a holiday. So my answer is: Both. Always both.Like a good drink it is all in the mix. And the ice. And the company.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Answering questions about writing.Other than that, it's the constant struggle with self-confidence. But everyonewho tries to be creative of course deals with that. I don't think anyone who isaltogether sure of themselves has ever produced anything really good at all. Ifyou're totally sure of yourself, you have nothing left to prove. Doubting isalmost always the first step.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I do, quite a bit. I think one hasto, to become better at writing. Musicians have to listen to music, artists haveto watch other artists’ art… It's just the way you learn. My favourite authorwould be Astrid Lindgren.

Then you're not ‘aspiring’anymore and that's a really good first step.

FBI Special Agent Matthew Roarke has been working for this moment: the capture of a killer who savagely hunts the worst of humanity. But Roarke remains traumatized by his own near-death at the hands of the serial killer who slaughtered Cara’s family…and haunted by the enigmatic woman who saved his life.Then the sixteen-year-old prostitute who witnessed Cara’s most recent murder goes missing, and suddenly pimps are turning up dead on the streets of San Francisco, killed with an MO eerily similar to Cara’s handiwork.Is a new killer on the loose with a mission even more deadly than hers? In the pulse-pounding third Huntress/FBI Thrillers book, Roarke will have to go on the hunt…and every woman he meets, even those closest to him, may prove deadly.My verdictCold Moon is the third Alexandra Sokoloff book that I have read. And I certainly wasn't disappointed. I love the plot and the characters and look forward to reading book four (no pressure Alexandra Sokoloff, none at all...).In Cold Moon, Special Agent Matthew Roarke wants to help female serial killer Cara, who is now awaiting trial. But he knows that this would be against everything he believes in as an FBI agent. The book focuses on the characters' emotions: Cara's need to fight evil and Roarke's struggle with his own feelings. You can almost see the sexual tension sizzling between them. Then there's also the problem of copycat murders - since Cara is locked up, she definitely can't be the culprit, so who else is to blame?Cold Moon is a great crime thriller, with a fascinating story, snappy dialogue and writing that moves at a cracking pace. The book is highly descriptive and filled with suspense and intrigue. I love the cat and mouse 'game' between Roarke and Cara. Plus there are some other great female characters in this book, especially Jade and Rachel.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Click below to read my reviews of the first two books:Huntress MoonBlood MoonI am delighted that TAMI HOAG is joining me on my blog today. Tami's latest book - Cold Cold Heart - was published by Orion on15 January 2015. So Tami, what inspired you to write crime fiction/thrillers, having started off as a romance writer? It was a natural progression for me, whichdoesn’t speak well about my love life, I suppose. As I started playing withelements of suspense in the romance novels, I found I enjoyed that quite a lot.I like digging deep into the psychologyof the characters, and being able to explore the darker sides of the humanpsyche. And I’m very comfortable writing about cops. I understand them.Where do your ideas come from?Sometimes an actual crime will grab my attentionand raise questions I want to explore through my own characters.  Sometimes a story will develop out of acharacter’s experience in a past book. Sometimes an idea will strike full-blownout of the blue.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Sure, absolutely. Our own experiences colour our perceptionsand shape our opinions. There’s no way to keep that out of the fabric of thewriting in subtle ways and in obvious ways. Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Character-driven gritty suspense with crackinggood dialogue.   Do you have any strange writing habits?When I’m in 'the zone' and really seeing andhearing the characters in my head, I don’t look at the screen. I look down and to the left. I don’t knowwhy. I don’t question these things.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?The story has to unfold organically for me. I know the crime the story will revolve around, and I know a few of the characters. I might think I have an idea of where the story will go, but it always twists and turns and unexpected things happen. That's what keeps me motivated. I want to see how all the pieces fit together in the end.Your books obviously involve in-depth research. What's the most interesting place that you have visited for one of your books? And what's the strangest? Have you visited anywhere particularly frightening?South Louisiana is the most interesting placeI’ve done research. I spent a couple of days with a parish (county) sheriff ina very rural area. He kept introducing me to all his cronies by saying I waswriting a book about a corrupt Southern sheriff.  That bayou country is like no place else.  His driving was the most frightening thingI’ve encountered! I thought for sure we would run off the road into the swampand be devoured by alligators.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Well, I hate the business part ofbeing a writer. Writers are artists, but publishing is a business, and I don’tfind those two things mesh very well. Within the writing itself, the hardest thing is relaxing within theprocess and trusting I’ll find my way through it. When I have that greatfeeling of being in the zone, I think it will never go away. And when it goesaway, I panic that it will never come back.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I love to read, but don’t getenough time to do as much reading as I would like strictly for pleasure.  I’ve got my nose in a psychology book, or aprocedural manual a lot of the time. When I get to read for pleasure, I try tosample a lot of different kinds of books, and, of course, catch up with what myfriends are writing.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'Stronger'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?1. Write what you love, and bepassionate about what you do.2. Educateyourself about the business of writing. It’s not enough to write a decent book. You have to be savvy about what to do with it in the marketplace.And lastly, why should people read Cold Cold Heart?I have such an aversion toblowing my own horn, I’m literally cringing here. How about this... Read Cold Cold Heart - It’s a darn good story.About Tami HoagTami Hoag has written 15 consecutive New York Times bestsellers and has more than 35 million books in print, published in more than 20 languages worldwide.

{"title": "A Mother's Story by Amanda Prowse", "date": "Tuesday 16 June 2015", "text": "A Mother's StoryBy Amanda ProwsePublished by Head of Zeus (26 February 2015)ISBN: 978-1781856581Publisher's descriptionJessica's wedding was like a fairytale. She looked radiant in a dress strewn with crystals. Her Dad conquered his nerves and made a tearful speech. And her gorgeous husband Matthew declared himself the luckiest man alive. Together, Jessica and Matthew feel like they can take on the world. But when their beautiful baby girl is born, Jessica is gripped with panic and fear. She can't tell anyone how she feels. Even when her life starts to spiral out of control…This is her story. A mother's story.My verdictI loved this book and couldn't put it down. A Mother's Story triggered so many of my emotions as I read - I laughed, I cried, I felt angry, I felt sad ...The book's prologue pulled me in straight away, as Jessica enters into her new 'home', clearly distraught, scared and broken by recent events. The rest of the book carefully weaves together two parallel stories. There's Jessica and Matthew in past, getting married, setting up home and planning their future together. Then there's Jessica writing in her present day diary (starting after the prologue), which spans nearly three years.Jessica and Matthew seem so normal - no different to any other couple about to become parents for the first time. Yet when their baby is born, after a difficult labour and birth, Jessica struggles to cope. She refuses to ask for help, and Matthew and her family believe that she just needs to pull herself out of her 'baby blues'.A Mother's Story is written beautifully. While it's a fictional account, the underlying issue of post-natal depression is a serious one for many women, and Amanda Prowse has tackled it with great sensitivity. I read the last couple of chapters hiding from my family, so they didn't see the tears running down my cheeks. This was one of the most moving books I have read for some time - maybe because it tackles such a 'real' issue and has such 'normal' characters.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through the Lovereading Review Panel in exchange for an honest review.A Brutal TradeBy Faith MortimerPublished by Topsails Charter (12 June 2015)ISBN: 978-1512367478Publisher's descriptionEven on a small island, the darkest secrets can't stay buried forever…It began like any normal day in Cyprus… except it wasn't… the body of a woman brutally murdered and discovered in a shallow grave changes all that.It is only days later when amateur sleuth, Diana Rivers, and old flame, Chief Superintendent Adam Lovell, discover a second female victim… only this time the discovery is even more chilling and shocks the island inhabitants.Joining forces with local policeman, Sergeant Yiannis Loukiades, the three embark on a journey that takes them on the fringes of humanity. Disturbing secrets are unearthed. They are on the hunt for killers who will stop at nothing in their hunt for one vital woman.As the bodies mount up, the detectives ask themselves one question. What is the reason for the women's deaths and their horrific mutilations?With the investigation quickly gathering momentum, Diana finds herself exposed to great danger… in the sighs of a lethal individual who'll put a stop to her meddling. Each move could be deadly… vicious in its outcome… can the team bring a halt to this brutal trade?My verdictThis is my first Diana Rivers book, and I can't believe that I haven't discovered this series before now.Firstly it's set in the beautiful island of Cyprus, with lovely vivid descriptions of the stunning scenery. Secondly it tackles some serious crimes, in this case human trafficking. And thirdly, it's an excellent murder-mystery filled with believable but colourful characters.I whizzed through A Brutal Trade from beginning to end, desperate to know what would happen next. Even though I haven't read any of the previous Diana Rivers books (this is the 7th), I picked up the backstory of each of the characters with ease. And it didn't take long for the main characters to feel like old friends. The background about Cyprus and human trafficking is woven seamlessly into the plot, and the rich dialogue keeps the story flowing at a fast pace.A Brutal Trade isn't intended to be comfort reading, thanks to its highly thought-provoking underlying story. But it's definitely an easy read that I would recommend to anyone who likes crime fiction with a serious message. Faith Mortimer certainly isn't afraid to tackle difficult subject matter.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.Read my Author in the Spotlight Q&A feature with Faith here."},

He has now served his time and was recently released from prison. But a fresh look at the evidence suggests that he was innocent all along. Following Eve's murder, it appears that Melody could be in danger again.The Life I left Behind is a well-written page turner. It's filled with suspense, twists and turns, manipulation, heartbreak and intrigue. The book is primarily a story about searching for Eve's murderer, using clues from Melody's past. But it's also a story about Melody's traumatised mind, and her journey to regaining her memory and confidence.Colette McBeth is a talented storyteller, and I now can't wait to read her previous book Precious Thing."},

Her grandmother's letters lead her to an apartment building full of drunks, monsters, attach dogs, and totally ordinary old crones - but also to the truth about fairytales and kingdoms and a grandmother like no other.My verdictMy Grandmother Sends Her Regards & Apologises is a tale of grief, love, fairytale stories and make believe. It's the story of a tight bond between a young girl (precocious seven-year-old Elsa) and her nutty grandmother - and what happens when Elsa's grandmother dies.Elsa's grandmother has always told her stories of mythical creatures, heroes and villains, dragons and princesses - a whole new world for Elsa to discover simply by using her imagination. When her grandmother dies, Elsa embarks on a treasure hunt to deliver letters from her grandmother to the intended recipients. Along the way, she meets a range of bizarre people and learns more about her grandmother's past. All of the characters are intriguing and bring the story to life.My Grandmother Sends Her Regards & Apologises is also a story of growing up. Elsa is already wise beyond her years (she seems more like a 10-year-old rather than a seven-year-old), but there are always things for a child to learn in an adult world. It's also a book about saying 'sorry' - atoning for past mistakes.At times I did get a bit confused with all the fairytale kingdoms, which have quite similar-sounding names. Yet this was a highly compelling read and it was easy to lose myself in the story. I can see this could be a 'Marmite' book - you'll either love it or hate it - but I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes quirky stories. Underneath the surface, there's a deeper story too - you'll just have to read the book to find it, as I don't like to give too much away in my reviews.I received a copy of the book from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted that FAITH MORTIMER is joining me on my blog today. Faith's latest book - A Brutal Trade - is published by Topsails Charter today (12 June 2015). So Faith, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?Firstly, may I thank you for inviting me onto your blogtoday? I feel honoured and I appreciate being asked. I’vealways played around with words. From a young age I wrote stories and littleplays, which I forced my younger sisters to listen to. I started a couple ofnovels in my teens and twenties – but the time wasn’t right. Finally, when thekids were at Uni, my business was almost running itself, and I’d completed ascience degree, I realised that the time was right to pen that first novel!Where do your ideas come from?Anywhere and everywhere. I can watch a play/film or read abook and my mind goes off at a tangent. I unashamedly eavesdrop on interestingconversations and a few choice words or subject will spark an idea and I haveto get it written down.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Oh lots! I am a registered qualified nurse, so this comes inhandy for medical experience and understanding human psyche. I’ve alwaysenjoyed sports: running, skiing, walking and I’m a qualified Yacht Master –I’ve incorporated ideas and examples of experiences into lots of my books. After a change in direction from nursing, I’ve run variousbusinesses and this has helped when choosing a ‘job’ for characters. Sitting for a degree later in life gave me confidence ingetting to grips with starting my first novel.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Easy to read, partly descriptive so readers visualise thescenes.Do you have any strange writing habits?Not that I can think of.You write books that fit into a range of genres, from psychological thrillers and crime/mystery novels to romantic fiction. Is it easy to switch between them?So far, yes! I get really involved in the thrillers andcrime/mystery novels; partaking in lots of interesting research. Keeping trackof clues/time/feasibility of a plot can be hard and has my head frequently in aspin. After a few novels like this I find writing romance completely different.No less research is conducted, but because the books are very different it actsas a buffer - almost like a holiday, and I do enjoy it. My romance are notchick-lit though – more edgy women’s literature with a romantic interest.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I usuallyhave a basic idea and outline before I begin writing. As I get further into themain part of the story, small sub-plots begin to develop. Often these canenrich the story but I only allow them to continue if I feel they add to theoverall plot. They’re not padding, but flesh out characters and their liveswhich are important to the main theme.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Writing the first chapter. I repeatedly write the first fewpages and then at some later stage go back and rewrite the whole scene. I thinkit’s because my characters come properly to life further into the book andgetting started they’re still shadowy figures. Once I’ve finished I go throughthe script a dozen times, adding and deleting sentences which add nothing to agood plot.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Yes, of course! That question is difficult though as Ichange my favourite authors yearly. I love good female crime writers, P D Jamesfor one, M M Kaye for adventure, James Michener for history. Ooops I thinkthey’re all deceased! Seriously I enjoy contemporary authors too, but there aretoo many to mention and I don’t want to upset anyone by leaving them off thelist. We’re so lucky as we’re spoilt for choice these days!If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?This is a tricky one as there are lots of titles I could use, but something along the lines of: 'No Such Word as Can't.' I always remember my grandmother who was a 'no-nonsense' sort of lady, chiding me when I was small if I moaned that I couldn't do something. I think life is what you make of it. There's no point saying you can't do something if you haven't bothered to get up and try. This applies to everything you meet head on - grasp life with both hands, use it well and hopefully you'll find a way to meet at least part of your dreams.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Never give up. No matter if you believe the last 2000 wordsyou wrote are rubbish – leave them for 24 hours and then go back and readthrough. A few changes can make a world of difference. Also, I believe authorstoday hold their destiny in their own hands. It is you who decides whether youwant to go it alone as an independent author or pursue a publisher. Stick toyour dreams and ideals, work hard and if you’re determined then you can make aliving from writing. Finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. There arehundreds of lovely authors who are willing to give you a few pointers –remember they’ve been there before.And lastly, why should people read A Brutal Trade?Because it’s a darn good read(!) Seriously the theme of mylatest novel is close to my heart. Human trafficking is rife and found inalmost every country worldwide. 10 Countries account for 76% of the total 30million estimates.  Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing crimesin the world and is the world’s second largest criminal enterprise, afterdrugs. (2013 Global Slavery Index). This I find appalling in today’s so called modern world. Mynew book, A Brutal Trade, covers the basics of trafficking and the illegal saleof human body parts. The subject matter is grim, but I’ve done my best not todwell too much on the graphic side of things. I’ve built a story round thetopic – one with an ending which readers will enjoy and agree with. Iplan to donate 20% of the royalties from the sale of this book totwo leading anti-trafficking charities.About Faith MortimerFaith is a British author dividing her time between Hampshire (UK) and Cyprus.

{"title": "Blood Moon by Alexandra Sokoloff", "date": "Thursday 11 June 2015", "text": "Blood MoonBy Alexandra SokoloffPublished by Thomas & Mercer (27 January 2015)ISBN: 978-1477822050Publisher's descriptionTwenty-five years have passed since a savage killer terrorised California, massacring three ordinary families before disappearing with a trace. The only surviving victim of his rampage was a child… who is now wanted by the FBI for brutal crimes of her own.Special Agent Matthew Roarke is on the interstate manhunt to track her down, despite feeling torn between dedication to duty and his sympathy for her horrific history and motives. But when Roarke's search unearths evidence of new family slayings, the dangerous woman he seeks - and secretly wants - may be his only hope of preventing another bloodbath. He just has to find her first.My verdictYet again Alexandra Sokoloff has written a great crime thriller. Blood Moon flows at a fast pace with plenty of action to keep the story moving. The plot is cleverly planned and executed and grabbed my attention all the way through.I've become a big fan of Matthew Roarke and his FBI team, who work well together and clearly have much admiration for one another. In this book, Roarke is determined to reel Cara in to account for her crimes. But his growing attraction to this female serial killer with a conscience could be getting in the way of his job. And there's a growing concern that his own life is in danger as he tries to lure Cara out of hiding.The characters are complex and the story is compelling, and I found it very hard to put the book down.  In fact, I was quite exhausted by the end of it, having held my breath through the last few chapters.Blood Moon follows straight on from the previous book Huntress Moon, so I would suggest that you read this series in order.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.The Raven's HeadBy Karen MaitlandPublished by Headline (12 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1472215062Publisher's descriptionVincent is an apprentice librarian who stumbles upon a secret powerful enough to destroy his master. With the foolish arrogance of youth, he attempts blackmail but the attempt fails and Vincent finds himself on the run and in possession of an intricately carved silver raven's head.Any attempt to sell the head fails… until Vincent tries to palm it off on the intimidating Lord Sylvain - unbeknown to Vincent, a powerful Alchemist with an all-consuming quest. Once more, Vincent's life is in danger because Sylvain and his neighbours, the menacing White Canons, consider him a predestined sacrifice in their shocking experiment.My verdictThe Raven's Head is an enjoyable gothic tale, a Medieval mystery with the science of alchemy at its heart. This dark, gritty historical novel is well written and, after a slow start to introduce all the characters, soon reaches a fast pace.The author has carefully weaved several tales together - the stories of three main characters, Vincent, Gisa and Wilky, whose fates seemed to be inextricably linked. All three tales are filled with treachery, darkness, danger and cruelty, and eventually collide in an explosive ending.I really like the author's writing style - it's engaging and easy to read. I felt that this particular book was story-led rather than character-led, as I found it hard to warm to any of the characters. But the supernatural and intrigue kept me reading until the final page.This is my first Karen Maitland novel and I look forward to reading more of her books.I received a copy from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Jen J Danna", "date": "Wednesday 10 June 2015", "text": "I am delighted that JEN J DANNA is joining me on my blog today. Her latest book Two Parts Blood Murder was published by Five Star Publishing on 18 February 2015. So Jen, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?TV shows that cut corners (like CSI and Bones) drive meabsolutely nuts. Forensic science simply can’t be done in under five minutes(and in the dark… really, are there no light switches in some of these places?).So I challenged myself to write a mystery with accurate science that was stillexciting. If PCR* can’t be done in two minutes to make a 100% match to yoursuspect (and it can’t), then that’s a challenge the characters have to dealwith. And challenges make for more interesting storytelling.[*PCR = polymerase chain reaction, a scientific technique used to amplify trace amounts of DNA and match criminals to crime scenes]Where do your ideas come from?Many places. Often they come from my partner Ann who alwaysstays on top of national and international news, and shoots interestingreal-life stories to me as idea prompts. One of our books was written because arelevant bone disorder was highlighted in a TV documentary. One book waswritten based on an offhand comment about architecture. One book we plan towrite is based on a real historical tragedy. So our ideas come from manyplaces.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?The biggest personal experience to influence my writing ismy career in science. Without it, I wouldn’t have had the background to learn acompletely new field of science on my own (as an aside, my job at a universitygave me access to all the scientific journals/texts I needed to learn it). Infectiousdiseases may be my background, but the science of forensics is fun andinteresting, and using it to tell stories has been very enjoyable.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Edgy mysteries accented by realistic science.You work as a scientist specialising in infectious diseases. How do you find the time to write as well?I have a slogan – ‘Sleep is for sissies’. But really, the trick issimply to work as much as you can possibly manage. I work before my day job, onmy lunch break, after work, after dinner and all weekend. It’s the only way toshoehorn in what is essentially two full-time jobs. Luckily for me, I have avery supportive family who understands the insanity of my schedule.Do you have any strange writing habits?Sadly, no. I’m incredibly boring in that respect. My writingis more about hitting my daily and weekly word counts, putting my butt in thechair, and just getting the job done. Not sexy, but very productive.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?Because we write mysteries, we have to plot the whole bookout from the beginning to make sure all the clues add up to the killing. Whatcan change though is how much we outline. We’ve tried a range of methods from afull fifteen page outline to milestoning, which is essentially hitting all themajor plot points and leaving the rest a little loose to allow for any leftturns that might develop during the writing. This last technique is what we tryto do more often than not now. However, for our new FBI K-9 Mysteries serieswith Kensington, because we sold it as a proposal, we had to fully outline thefirst book in the series and then provide story ideas for books two and three.That first book is what we’re writing now, and we’ll see where the outlinetakes us. I’m sure if something brilliant occurs to us while we’re drafting,we’ll have the freedom to go in a slightly different direction if it makes fora stronger story.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Without a doubt, it’s the first draft. Editing is never ashard as the first draft, but sometimes pulling those 85,000 words out of myhead can be a real struggle. Especially if the day job has been high stress orexhausting, it can be hard to find the creativity needed for the drafting phase.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?Simply due to time constraints, my reading these days mostlycomes in the form of audiobooks. Though mysteries are my go-to genre, I try toread widely in both fiction and non-fiction. Current authors I’m enjoyinginclude J.D. Robb, Robert Galbraith, Kathy Reichs and Louise Penny. Right nowI’m listening to ‘Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania’ by EricLarson, who always writes fascinating narrative nonfiction novels aroundinteresting and tragic events.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'How to Juggle in 12 Easy Lessons'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Be persistent. This is a subjective business that’s not forthe faint of heart or the thin of skin. Just because one (or 10 or 90)people don’t think they can sell your book, you’re looking for the one agentand the one editor who can. And those people are out there; it’s all aboutmaking the right connections and being patient until you do. Don’t try for afew weeks and then give up because it’s too hard. Believe in yourself and keeptrying. Our slogan for trying to get a traditional publishing deal has alwaysbeen ‘Go big or go home’. I didn’t want to look back in 10 or 20 years andthink ‘why didn’t I even try?’. So we took a shot at it, queried until we foundour agent, Nicole Resciniti, and she’s sold four books in one series and threein another for us. It can happen - just stick with it and don’t give up when itbecomes a difficult slog. Because at some point it will, but you can come out successfullyon the other side. We’re living proof of that.And lastly, why should people read your latest book?Two Parts Bloody Murder is the fourth book in the Abbott andLowell Forensic Mysteries, but it can be read as a standalone if you haven’tread the previous three novels. In it, Massachusetts State Police Trooper LeighAbbott and forensic anthropologist (and ex-Marine) Matt Lowell team up to solvewhat turns out to be a series of murders spanning over 80 years. Set againstthe fascinating historical backdrop of 1930s Boston Prohibition, it will takeall the skills and knowledge of Matt, Leigh, their team of grad students, andMedical Examiner Dr. Edward Rowe to stop the killing spree before the nextvictim is lost.About Jen J DannaA scientist specialising in infectious diseases, Jen works as part of a dynamic research group at a cutting-edge Canadian university. However, her true passion lies in indulging her love of the mysterious through her writing. Together with her partner Ann Vanderlaan, she crafts suspenseful crime fiction with a realistic scientific edge. Their Abbott and Lowell Forensic Mysteries include Dead, Without a Stone to Tell It; No One Sees Me ’Till I Fall; A Flame in the Wind of Death; Two Parts Bloody Murder; and Lament the Common Bones (coming in 2016).

But a murder committed so many years ago still has the power to reverberate decades later with deadly consequences.It's a double surprise for Trooper Leigh Abbott as she investigates a cold case and discovers two murder victims in a historic nineteenth-century building. Together with forensic anthropologist Matt Lowell and medical examiner Dr. Edward Rowe, she uncovers the secrets of a long-forgotten, Prohibition-era speakeasy in the same building. But when the two victims are discovered to be relatives - their deaths separated by over eighty years - the case deepens, and suddenly the speakeasy is revealed as ground zero for a cascade of crimes through the decades.When a murder committed nearly forty years ago comes under fresh scrutiny, the team realises than an innocent man was wrongly imprisoned and the real murderer is still at large. Now they must solve three murders spanning over eighty years if they hope to set a wronged man free....Read my review of Two Parts Bloody Murder here Keep Your Friends CloseBy Paula DalyPublished by Corgi - Transworld (Paperback - 21 May 2015)ISBN: 978-0552169349Publisher's descriptionYou've been friends since university, when you became the people you are today.You don't see each other enough but when you do it's as if you've never been apart.She's one of the family. You would trust her with your life, your children, your husband.And when your daughter is rushed to hospital, you're grateful that she's stepping in at home, looking after things.But your best friend isn't who you think she is. You're about to find out just how wrong you were.My verdictKeep Your Friends Close is a great psychological thriller and I was absorbed into the story straight away. I was completely gripped and read the book in a couple of hours during one quiet Saturday afternoon.Natty and Sean think they have a happy marriage until her old university friend Eve decides to pay them a visit. When their teenage daughter Felicity is suddenly taken ill in France, Natty rushes to be by her side - leaving Sean and Eve together at the family home with Felicity's older sister Alice. That's when things go horribly wrong.Eve is a nasty piece of work. As a result, the book brought several of my emotions to the surface. I shouted (in my mind) at Natty when she told Sean to stay behind with Eve - and then shouted (again in my mind) at Sean too, as it all started to go horribly wrong. I then shouted 'yes' (out loud this time) right at the very end of the book, although I did feel a bit guilty (and worryingly evil) for doing so.I felt sorry for the two teenagers, who were caught in the middle of the family upheaval and were already a little neglected by both of their hard-working parents. But I did feel that Paula Daly portrayed their teenage angst very well. Sean was a bit too quick to abandon his seemingly happy life with his family, but I guess that may have been down to Eve's highly manipulative influence.I enjoyed being reunited with DC Joanne Aspinall and her mad aunt Jackie, who appeared in Paula Daly's first novel 'Just What Kind Of Mother Are You?'. I thought it was particularly good that these two characters didn't take over the plot, as this meant that the story could focus on the family instead.Keep Your Friends Close is a fast-paced read, and I look forward to Paula Daly's next book - The Mistake I Made - which is being published in August 2015.I received a copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

One night, she stumbles upon a striking young man alone in the woods photographing moon-lit trees. From that moment, Coralie knows her life will never be the same.The dashing photographer Coralie spies is Eddie Cohen, a Russian immigrant who has run away from this father's Lower East Side Orthodox community. As Eddie photographs the devastation on the streets of New York following the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, he comes embroiled in the mystery behind a young woman's disappearance.My verdictThe Museum of Extraordinary Things is a book of love, mystery and conformity, carefully weaving together fact and fiction. The reader is transported to Coney Island in 1911 New York, where life is hard, particularly for anyone who doesn't fit in with the 'normal' society.Coralie's father owns a small 'freak show' museum on the Coney Island boardwalk, filling it with anyone with a deformity or unusual ability. Coralie herself was born with webbed hands and is a gifted swimmer, trained to hold her breath under water for long periods of time.Russian immigrant Eddie Cohen is rebelling against his orthodox Jewish past, abandoning his devout father and his faith in search of his own destiny. He inherits a photography business, and spends his days photographing and investigating horrendous crimes.The two star-crossed lovers fall under each other's spell after just one brief meeting, yet circumstances keep them apart. Both characters have to come to terms with the past in order to move on.The Museum of Extraordinary Things contains vivid descriptions set against a fascinating historical background of freak shows and Coney Island life. It was a little slow in places, particularly in relation to the interaction between the two main characters. I would have preferred it if the mystery that Eddie needed to solve and his actual meeting with Coralie had come earlier in the book. However, this is still an interesting story about struggling to fit in.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted that KEITH NIXON is joining me on my blog today. His crime fiction book - The Corpse Role - was published on 10 April 2015 by Gladius Press. So Keith, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I've wanted to write as long as I can remember, but I kept hunting for an idea to hang the story off. The Eagle's Blood came from a visit to Maiden Castle. The Fix came from coming to terms with losing my job - I killed an ex-boss!Where do your ideas come from?Most of them - no idea! The initial kernel for a story really is the key to the whole thing. Usually this is character based - people are stories, after all. But writing is a constant stream of ideas.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Yes, and no. I've never murdered anyone, seen a dead body or been in the middle of a pitched battle between Romans and Britons. But I can write about them through research and imagination. And there are people I've met and conversations I've had that inspire certain events. Ultimately, books are a product of experience.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Short, punchy, dialogue anf character based, dash of humourDo you have any strange writing habits?Not really. I tend to write early in the morning before everyone else is up. And I typically get stuck 30% into a novel and have a serious look back, but neither are strange...Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?A mix. I'll have the idea, some chapters plotted, an ending (which usually changes) and some characters. But beyond that, it evolves as the writing flows.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Getting beyond the 30% point! Being flushed with the idea creates a lot of energy, but once you're awash with problems and challenges to solve it becomes more of a grind. Persistence is the key requirement in being a writer.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?As much as I can, I review for two blog sites. There are so many to list, but Ian Rankin I admire greatly, the late Terry Pratchett, Bernard Cornwell and Tony Black. There are also indie authors pleasing a trail - Ryan Bracha, Mark Wilson and Gerard Brennan among many.How has your life changed since becoming a published author?I have a lot more to do now. I attempt to keep up a constant stream of writing, which requires time. My social media contact has expanded greatly, and I get a lot out of talking to writers and readers.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'Really?'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Just keep writing - there's no such thing as an overnight success.And lastly, why should people read your latest book?People should read The Corpse Role, because it's a crime thriller with a hell of a twist at the end you'll never see coming!About Keith NixonKeith Nixon has been writing since he was a child. In fact, some of his friends (and his wife) say he's never really grown up. Keith is currently gainfully employed in a senior sales role, meaning he gets to use his one skill, talking.

{"title": "Amy Snow by Tracy Rees", "date": "Monday 8 June 2015", "text": "Amy SnowBy Tracy ReesPublished by Quercus (9 April 2015)ISBN: 978-1784291457Publisher's descriptionAbandoned on a bank of snow as a baby, Amy is taken in at nearby Hatville Court. But the masters and servants of the grand estate prove cold and unwelcoming. Amy's only friend and ally is the sparkling young heiress Aurelia Vennaway. So when Aurelia tragically dies young, Amy is devastated. But Aurelia leaves Amy one last gift. A bundle of letters with coded key. A treasure hunt that only Amy can follow. A life-changing discover awaits… if only she can unlock the secret.My verdictI fell in love with the book Amy Snow. It's beautifully written, with the language and phrases used in the narrative and dialogue in keeping with the time period in which it's set. The story flows from beginning to end, making this fascinating book difficult to put down.Amy Snow was discovered as a newborn by eight-year-old heiress Aurelia Vennaway. She was brought up on the grand Hatville Court Estate but is shunned by the household, especially Aurelia's parents. Amy has no idea who she is or where she came from. When Aurelia dies at a tragically young age, Amy is sent away by the family, seemingly with no money or possessions. But Aurelia has a surprised planned for Amy - even death can't destroy their friendship.On reading Amy Snow, I felt like I was in middle of a period drama, living and breathing every scene. This would make an amazing television adaptation or even a film on the big screen. The story is full of life, with brilliant characters, vivid descriptions of people and places, secrets to unveil and an intriguing underlying story.I really didn't want Amy Snow to end, and I envy anyone who gets to read this for the first time.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

Next to her, the skeletal remains of another girl. One victim had been there for sixty days, the other for 10 years.Drugs, theft and reckless speeders are the main worries in Meltzer's country; homicide is not his speciality. A friend at the Atlanta Police Department recommends a freelancer Meltzer has never heard of - former FBI profiler and private detective Keye Street...My verdictThis is my first Keye Street novel, but it certainly won't be my last.Don't Talk to Strangers has a great plot and fascinating characters. The bodies of two teenage girls are discovered deep in the forest; both have been killed in a violent manner, but the murders took place 10 years apart. It's clear that the girls were held and tortured for some time before they were murdered. Keye Street is called upon by the local sheriff for her expertise. When another girl goes missing, the race is on to find her.I really enjoyed this book. It contains a bit of everything - well-formed characters, a well-constructed plot, humour, romantic interest, forensics, tension, twists and a mystery to solve. Keye Street is feisty, not afraid to speak her mind and a talented investigator. The book reminded me of Janet Evanovitch's Stephanie Plum novels, which I used to read years ago, but in my opinion this was far better. I was completely surprised by the ending - I thought I had guessed the murderer's identity correctly.If, like me, you haven't read an Amanda Kyle Williams' Keye Street book yet, this can easily be read as a standalone.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review.Rise of the EnemyBy Rob SinclairPublished by Clink Street Publishing (30 April 2015)ISBN: 978-1909477896Publisher's descriptionEveryone has a breaking point. Carl Logan might just have found his. For the past 19 years, Agent Carl Logan has devoted his life to his work for the Joint Intelligence Agency; an intelligence agency controlled jointly by the USA and the UK. Policing, espionage and elite armed forces combined in one secretive and powerful network.When the JIA sends Logan on a routine mission to Russia it should have been simple. But when his cover is blown, he's transported into a world of hell he thought he would never see again.Something is different this time, though, and before long doubts begin to surface in Logan's mind as to why the assignment went so wrong. Logan has never been short of enemies. And sometimes the enemy is closer to home than you think.Could his own people really have set him up? The odds are against him. But Logan isn't a man who likes to be cornered. And when you poke a caged animal, you'd better be prepared for the consequences...My verdictYet again Rob Sinclair dives straight into the action. In his latest book Rise of the Enemy, special agent Carl Logan is captured and tortured for three months. He is left wondering whether he has been abandoned by his Agency. And he has no idea who to trust. The story switches between past and present - Logan's current situation on the run and what happened to him over the last three months.Rob Sinclair has a descriptive way of writing, incorporating facts about his characters without making this a chore to read. So even someone's eye colour or clothing seems relevant, and nothing is superfluous. His characters are so well developed that you feel like you know them personally by the end of the book. The intrigue and action last from beginning to end.This is a great book for fans of Jack Reacher and Ben Hope. I hope that the author has a third Carl Logan book planned.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Read my review of the first book - Dance with the Enemy - here.Dance with the EnemyBy Rob SinclairPublished by Clink Street Publishing (2 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1909477087Publisher's descriptionCarl Logan was the perfect agent. A loner, with no real friends or family, he was trained to deal with any situation with cold efficiency, devoid of emotion. But Logan isn't the man he used to be, or the asset he once was. Five months ago his life changed forever when he was captured, tortured and left for dead by Youssef Selim, one of the world's most violent terrorists. When Selim mysteriously reappears in Paris, linked to the kidnapping of America's Attorney General, Logan smells his chance for revenge. Pursuing his man relentlessly, oblivious to the growing trail of destruction that he leaves in his wake, Logan delves increasingly deep into the web of lies and deceit surrounding the kidnapping. Finally, he comes to learn just what it means to Dance with the Enemy.My verdictDance with the Enemy will appeal to fans of Jack Reacher and Ben Hope. The book contains a bit of everything you would expect from an action thriller - fast-paced writing, dramatic chase scenes, deception, revenge and even a hint of romance.Carl Logan is a special agent, rescued from life as an unruly teenager with little future and trained to become a killing machine. He has a habit of acting before thinking, which can leave disaster and dead bodies in his wake. Yet he gets the villain in the end.The action kicks off straight away, which really drew me into the story, and I found the book hard to put down. I loved the well-developed characters, particular Logan and his interaction with his boss Mackie and FBI agent Grainger (who brought out his softer side).I couldn't wait to read the next book - Rise of the Enemy - so read it straight after this one. I hope a third Carl Logan book is in the planning.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Read my review of the second book - Rise of the Enemy here."},

They don't make you choose sides.Best friends don't keep secrets about their past. They don't put you in danger.Best friends don't always stay best friends.My verdictThe Broken is a chilling psychological thriller focusing on the dangers of getting too involved in friends' relationship problems. And how you may discover that you don't really know your best friends at all.This is the story of best friends Dan and Sasha and Josh and Hannah, and what happens when Dan decides to leave Sasha for a younger model (literally). As Dan and Sasha's marriage breaks down, cracks start to appear in Josh and Hannah's marriage too. All four lives are plunged into turmoil, as they struggle to adapt to their changing relationships. Josh and Hannah are unsure where their loyalties lie as conflicting stories are revealed. It's difficult to know which one - Dan or Sasha - they should trust.Tamar 'Tammy' Cohen has the knack of creating believable characters, so normal that they would be right at home in your own backyard. These days, it's fairly commonplace for marriages to break down, and this book felt very real. I could imagine myself in very similar scenarios and experiencing the same feelings as Josh and Hannah.The memoir of a young girl dotted throughout the book keeps the suspense going. I did guess the twist at the end, but it was still cleverly written.

The isolated stretch of road is dark, and with her four-year-old daughter Maggie asleep in the backseat, Faith refuses to let the stranger in.What she sees next will haunt her forever.When the missing-person posters go up, Faith's guilt consumes her. Then the girl's body turns up and her perfect life begins to unravel. Because it turns out Maggie wasn't asleep that night and - unlike her mother - she's not afraid to speak up. Maggie's testimony leads to an arrest, but Faith is the only one who can identify a second man who was at the scene of the crime. She has one chance to convince a jury of what happened. If she fails, two murderers will go free - two men who have killed before and who will undoubtedly kill again. And they know exactly where to find Faith and her family.My verdictAll the Little Pieces is a roller coaster read. It's an enjoyable mixture of courtroom drama, psychological thriller and crime novel.Faith seems to have the perfect life, until you delve beneath the surface. Driving home from her sister's house late at night, in the middle of nowhere, a girl's battered face appears at her car window, asking Faith for help.

And as the story progresses, this secret is gradually revealed, with devastating consequences.The book is an easy read and moves at a fast pace.

I thought this was going to be another thriller or crime novel, trying to establish why, how or even whether Dr Maria Martinez killed the priest. While this is a major focus of the plot, the story is far more intriguing and thought-provoking. I'm not going to give away any spoilers, so you will have to read the book to find out more about the plot. But I will say - expect the unexpected.The highly intelligent narrator, Maria, has Asperger's and is gifted in deciphering complex patterns and codes. She is written with sensitivity and without exaggeration, making her feel very real. Maria can't 'read' people's emotions, concentrating only on the facts as she sees them, so she has difficulty knowing who to trust. This makes Maria easily manipulated and an unreliable witness. She can't remember committing the murder and is struggling to prove her innocence.This character-driven thriller starts off slowly, but soon picks up speed as it gets under way. The well-written narrative drifts between the past (in the prison) and present (in therapy sessions). There are no clear divisions between the two time frames, but I found this easy to follow once I became used to the plot. During the book, Maria meets an interesting array of characters and, like her, I wasn't sure who she should be trusting until the final few pages.This is the first book in a trilogy. While the mystery of the murder is resolved by the end, I felt that there is still far more to learn about Maria and her past.

His empty boat was found washed ashore on the rocks - but his body was never found. Now Molly has returned to the sands of Cornwall haunted by his disappearance, unable to accept he is gone. Joey was an experienced sailor and died on a calm sea - things just don't add up and Molly can't let it go. Desperate for answers, she turns to Joey's best friend, Ben, to go back to what really happened that day...My verdictI Do Not Sleep is the story of a mother coming to terms with her son's tragic demise. Joey is believed to have been killed in a terrible sailing accident in Cornwall five years earlier. Since no body has ever been found, although the boat was recovered, Molly doesn't know what happened to 20-year-old Joey and has found it very difficult to move on with her life. She returns to Cornwall, with the rest of her family, determined to discover what happened to her son.I Do Not Sleep contains some lovely descriptions of Cornwall and a whole host of interesting characters. The story focuses on Molly's emotions. I think she is supposed to come across as obsessive and self-destructive, but I found her selfish when it came to the needs of the rest of her family, particularly her husband, and this meant I found it hard to relate to her. The story builds up gradually, but most of the action takes place in the last couple of chapters. The ending is very cliched and quite unbelievable, but it does tie up all the loose ends.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

A single father, he has raised his children with the same quiet and absolute dedication he brings to his forestry business, but now he's discovering that might not have been enough.When his son Curtis, on the brink of adulthood, disappears after a tragic accident, it falls to Tom, the hunger, to track him down. Whether he can truly reach Curtis is another matter.My verdictThe Mountain Can Wait's vivid descriptions take the reader right into the heart of Wild Canada. I visited Canada last year, specifically Vancouver, Vancouver Island and the Rockies, and this book brought back memories of Canada's natural beauty, particularly the lakes, forests, mountains and wildlife.The Mountain Can Wait is the story of one particular family. Tom Berry is a loner and a natural hunter, spending most of his time planting trees in the Canadian mountains. He loves the quiet life in the mountains but has responsibilities back at home. He married too young and too quickly. When his wife abandoned the family home, Tom was forced to bring up his two young children practically single handed.Several years on, his son Curtis has already left home, and his daughter Erin will soon be at University. Tom usually tries to fix other people's messes but steers clear of his own. But when Curtis is involved in a hit-and-run incident, Tom realises that there are some things that can't be fixed. Then Curtis goes missing, and Tom is forced to take a look at his relationship with both of his children. Ultimately, Tom has to learn the hard way that the mountain can wait, as his children need him first.The story is a slow burner and not to be read if you want something uplifting. Nothing specific happens between the initial hit-and-run event and the final few chapters. Yet the book pulled at my emotions and the beautiful writing left me soaking up the atmosphere, bringing the Canadian wilderness to life.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through BookBridgr and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted that CLARE MACKINTOSH is joining me on my blog today. Clare's debut novel - I Let You Go - was published in paperback on 7 May 2015 by Little Brown.  So Clare, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?I always wanted to write a book, but it took some time before I knew what type of book I wanted to write. Initially I wrote a romantic comedy, but I think I always knew I needed to write something grittier; more issues-based. The catalyst for I Let You Go was a real-life hit-and-run that killed a child in Oxford, many years ago. I Let You Go isn't that family's stories, but it tackles some of the issues an unsolved case throws up - both for the police and for the individuals involved.Where do your ideas come from?I'm never short of ideas! I like to write about 'what if?' questions: what if someone killed a child and just drove off? What if you realised your daughter had been switched at birth? What if someone was watching you every day? I kick them around for a bit to see if there's enough to explore to make a whole book, or if the idea is more suited for a short story. Newspaper and magazine articles are fantastic for sparking ideas - truth is definitely stranger than fiction.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Very much so. My son died when he was five weeks old, and my grief for him defines everything I do. My writing is very emotional, and when I write about loss - as I do in I Let You Go - I hope that my first-hand experiences make these authentic passages. Aside from that, the 12 years I spent in the police service brought me into contact with so many types of people and situations: it was phenomenal grounding for a writer.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Emotional, tense and hard-hitting with a few unexpected twists!Do you have any strange writing habits?A few, although they seem quite normal to me! I often write with my eyes shut, if I'm working on certain scenes. They might beparticularly emotional ones, or anything very visual, like two charactersphysically fighting. I shut my eyes and watch the scene play out in my head,like a film, and just let my fingers type what I’m seeing inside. Actually,that does sound strange… but it’s incredibly natural, and those scenes arealways very easy to write.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I’m a plotter. If I don’t plan then it’s incrediblyhard work and takes a very long time. That’s not to say that the plan doesn’tchange, but I do like to know where all the twists and turns and reveals aregoing to come.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?The first draft. I know lots of authors like that bit, but I find it hard going. Right now I'm about 55,000 words into my next book and I can already see so much wrong with it. I'm desperate to finish this draft so I can start fixing it. Editing is hard work but I find it really satisfying; like carving something out of stone and slowly watching it take shape.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I read widely and across all genres. I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Haynes and Sophie Hannah, both of whom plot so brilliantly, but recently I've read some amazing non-crime books, including Touch by Claire North and The Memory Book by Rowan Coleman. I don't have a favourite author, although looking at my bookshelves I have an awful lot of Jilly Cooper books! I think that's as much about nostalgia as anything - I'm not very good at getting rid of books.How has your life changed since becoming a published author?Beyond all measure. Writing books is my day job, although I still do some journalism, and even when it's hard I absolutely love it. Since my book came out, it's been incredibly exciting and rather hard to focus on my next book, which I must do!Congratulations on being chosen as a Richard and Judy Book Club summer read. I Let You Go has the best OMG moment I have read. Were you expecting it to have so much impact on the readers when you wrote the book (and in particular that twist)? Thank you! It's a tremendous honour to be chosen asa R&J read, and I’m still pinching myself. Both Richard and Judy have saidsome really lovely things about I Let You Go, particularly about ‘The Twist’,which I confess I’m really proud of. It was structurally quite a complicatedthing to pull off, but I knew that – if it worked – it would make for afantastic story. I was lucky to have a great editor and together we made sureit was as tight as possible. I LOVE hearing the reaction from readers when theyreach the twist – it’s honestly the best thing ever.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?Clare Mackintosh: from crime-fighter to crime-writerWhat advice do you have for aspiring writers?Keep going. Dull, I know, but so important. It doesn't happen overnight. I'm also a firm believer in networking, which is so often looked upon as a dirty word. Every opportunity I've ever had has come about as a result of personal connection, not a job application, cold call or straightforward submission. Call it socialising instead, if that's more palatable, but DO IT! Get out and meet people; chat to agents on Twitter; go to book launches. Never do anything with an agenda, but you'll find opportunities simply arise - it's the way people work.And lastly, why should people read I Let You Go?I’d love people to read my book because it’s mydebut, and because I’m hugely proud of it. If you enjoy psychological thrillersand you can handle some emotional punch, I think you’ll enjoy I Let You Go. Asfor the twist… well, let me know what you think!About Clare MackintoshClare Mackintosh is an author, feature writer and columnist.

Varg Veum sits by the hospital bedside of his long-term girlfriend Karin, whose life-threatening injuries provide a deeply painful reminder of the mistakes he's made. Investigating the seemingly innocent disappearance of a wind-farm inspector, Varg Veum is thrust into one of the most challenging cases of his career, riddled with conflicts, environmental terrorism, religious fanaticism, unsolved mysteries and dubious business ethics. Then, in the one of the most heart-stopping scenes in crime fiction, the first body appears...My verdictWe Shall Inherit the Wind is a detective story with an environmental focus. It's a mixture of a timeless whodunnit and the topical issues of wind farms and eco-warriers.Mons Mæland has been reported missing by his second wife. He owns a plot of land on an isolated island on which a wind farm is planned, and there are several people who may have wanted him out of the way. When Mons Mæland's body is discovered, it appears that he was the victim of a brutal murderer, and Varg Veum is drawn into a difficult and emotional case. A parallel plot involves the disappearance of Mons Mæland's first wife several years earlier - she's believed to have drowned, but no body has ever been found.We Shall Inherit the Wind is thought-provoking and gripping, and hooked me from the first chapter. The book has been translated so well that it's easy to forget that it wasn't originally written in English. Thanks to Gunnar Staalesen's vivid descriptions, I could picture the people and places in my mind as I read.Norwegian private investigator Varg Veum dwells on past mistakes as he tries to solve the case. As the plot unfolds, many layers are gradually peeled back, revealing family secrets against a backdrop of wind farm politics. Twists arrive like a bolt from the blue, throwing the reader (and Varg Veum) off course. The plot is chilling, addictive and tragic, with suspense that lasts from beginning to end.Gunnar Staalesen is known as one of the fathers of Nordic Noir - and I can see why. Yet to date only a handful of his books have been translated into English. The good news is that more Gunnar Staalesen books will be published by Orenda Books in 2016 and 2017.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Follow the Blog Tour"},

An avalanche and unremitting snowstorms close the mountain pass, and the 24-hour darkness threatens to push Ari over the edge, as curtains begin to twitch, and his investigation becomes increasingly complex, chilling and personal. Past plays tag with the present and the claustrophobic tension mounts, while Ari is thrust deeper into his own darkness - blinded by snow, and with a killer on the loose. Taut and terrifying, Snowblind is a startling debut from from an extraordinary new talent, taking Nordic Noir to soaring new heights.My verdictSnowblind is a literary whodunnit. Based in a remote Icelandic town, set against beautiful snow-covered peaks, this is an atmospheric chilling novel.The town of Siglufjörður is remote at the best of times and becomes virtually isolated during the winter months. Nothing much usually happens in this small community, so none of the locals are suspicious when a tragic fatal accident occurs. But rookie detective Ari Thor, fresh from police training in Reykjavik, has a hunch that something is amiss. When a woman is found unconscious in the snow, there are two cases for him to solve. There are also snowstorms and avalanches for him to contend with, as well as relationship dilemmas.This is a gentle slow-burning novel, with no graphic violence or big action scenes, and it kept me intrigued all the way through thanks to the sheer magic of its writing. There are beautiful descriptions of a harsh environment, stunning surroundings and a whole host of fascinating characters. There's certainly plenty there to make the reader fall in love with Iceland - and maybe with Ari Thor as well.This is an excellent debut novel, with several twists and turns, and has been well translated by Quentin Bates. To me, it was like reading a modern-day Icelandic Agatha Christie novel. I look forward to reading meeting Ari Thor again soon.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "The Versions of Us by Laura Barnett", "date": "Thursday 28 May 2015", "text": "The Versions of UsBy Laura BarnettPublished by Weidenfeld & Nicolson (28 May 2015)ISBN: 978-1474600163Publisher's descriptionWhat if you had said yes? The moments that change everything…The Versions of Us is a love story told three ways. A young man is walking down a country lane. A woman, cycling towards him, swerves to avoid a dog. On that moment, their future hinges. There are three possible outcomes, three small decisions that could determine the rest of their lives.Eva and Jim are nineteen and students at Cambridge when their paths first cross in 1958. There is also David, Eva's lover, an ambitious actor who loves Eva deeply but cares more about his own talent. The Versions of Us follows the three different courses their lives could take following this first chance meeting. Lives filled with love, betrayal and ambition, but through it all a deep connection that endures, whatever fate might throw at them.The Versions of Us explores the idea that there are moments when our lives might have turned out differently, the tiny factors or decisions that could determine our fate, and the precarious nature of the foundations upon which we build our lives. It is also a story about the nature of love and how it grows, changes and evolves as we travel through life.My verdictThe Versions of Us gives you three very similar love stories for the price of one. Its underlying concept - how one simple decision or a turn of fate chooses the path you lead - has been explored before (e.g. the Sliding Doors film staring Gwyneth Paltrow). In this book, the three stories follow Eva and Jim (and their friends and family) over the next 60 years.Each version of the story starts off in Cambridge, with 19-year-old Eva riding on her bike and then involved in an incident with a dog. From that moment, each version branches off in a different direction. Yet all three are inextricably linked. Clever little facts, such as relatives and friends, milestone parties, functions and events and clothing choices, give common threads throughout the different versions. It felt like spot the difference (or rather the similarities) when I noticed these.Laura Barnett has a very descriptive way of writing and weaves emotions into her story with ease. The stories were very well planned and must have been a logistical nightmare to construct, making sure they all followed in unison, like three parallel rivers following similar twisting paths and all set to end at the same point. The characters were all very real and easy to relate to. I found that I liked some characters in one version and hated them in another, due to the tiny differences in the paths they took and choices they made.I enjoyed all three versions. My only difficulty with the book was trying to keep track of people's relationships and all the children's names and ages in each version. I was very close to making a spreadsheet to help me keep track. Also, I found that sometimes the versions were out of sync, so version three was followed by version two, rather than version one, which confused me slightly. Every time I sat down to read more of the book, I had to have a quick recap in my mind.Overall, The Versions of Us is an enjoyable well-written story with a satisfying ending that tied up all the loose ends. It's an emotional roller coaster and I read the last few pages with tears in my eyes.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Evil GamesBy Angela MarsonsPublished by Bookouture (29 May 2015)ISBN: 978-1909490956Publisher's descriptionThe greater the evil, the more deadly the game…When a rapist is found mutilated in a brutal attack, Detective Kim Stone and her team are called in to bring a swift resolution. But, as more vengeful killings come to light, it soon becomes clear that there is someone far more sinister at work.With the investigation quickly gathering momentum, Kim soon finds herself exposed to great danger and in the sights of a lethal individual undertaking their own twisted experiment.Up against a sociopath who seems to know her every weakness, for Detective Stone, each move she makes could be deadly. As the body count starts to mount, Kim will have to dig deeper than ever before to stop the killing. And this time - it's personal.My verdictYet again Angela Marsons has written a 5* crime novel. I loved Silent Scream and was so excited to be given the opportunity to read the next one before publication. Evil Games is certainly as good as the first, if not better, and I wish I could give it a higher rating than 5/5.In Evil Games, we return to DI Kim Stone, the first-rate detective with a damaged past. In her second book, Angela Marsons gives us more background about Kim's horrific childhood, which was hinted about in the previous one. I love Kim's friendship and banter with Bryant, as it brings her softer side to the surface.This time, Kim has a great adversary in the form of an evil and creepy psychiatrist, Alexandra 'Alex' Thorne. Kim suspects something sinister is going on following a series of seemingly unrelated killings. As Alex delves into Kim's past, this becomes a terrifying game of cat and mouse.Evil Games is fast-paced writing and kept me intrigued from beginning to end.

{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Fergus McNeill", "date": "Wednesday 27 May 2015", "text": "I am delighted that FERGUS MCNEILL is joining me on my blog today. His three books - Eye Contact, Knife Edge and Cut Out - are published by Hodder & Stoughton. So Fergus, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?It really happened by accident. Like many people, I'd wanted to be a writer since I was a child at school, but I'd never quite got around to doing the actual writing part. Eventually, I joined a creative writing evening class because I thought it would force me to write regularly… and it did! One term, our tutor set us the challenge of beginning a novel; I started writing some chapters, which later became my first novel Eye Contact, and I suppose I've just kept going ever since.Where do your ideas come from?My ideas come from feelings, thoughts, pieces of music and a hundred other places. Inspiration is impossible to control, but there are ways that you can encourage it to work for you. For example, I try to write 'on location' as much as possible - making regular visits to areas where my stories take place. It's like walking on to the movie set of my book, and that always seems to spark new ideas and has me reaching for my laptop.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Many authors look into themselves to find authenticity for their characters. The personality of my series protagonist D.I. Harland is very much defined by a tragic bereavement, and I know that I drew on my own experiences of loss to write those sections in the books. My villains are based on other people - never me! - but I do sometimes base their workplace, or some of their colleagues, on my own ... just don't tell anyone!Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Close third person, fast-forwarding between the interesting bitsDo you have any strange writing habits?Writing 'on location' is probably my strangest habit, but I also make a point of listening to particular music whenever I write (mostly ambient, soundtracks or neo-classical). I use music as a kind of mental bookmark, avoiding those special songs or albums until the next time I'm writing, when they help me to quickly get back into the thought process I was in previously.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I usually have a reasonable idea where the story is going, but I've learned that the best inspiration often comes later in the journey, and I don't ever want to miss out on something great just because it wasn't in my initial chapter plan. So I treat those early plans as a kind of safety net - they're there in case I don't find anything better, but I'm always looking out for something unexpected as I go along.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?I find myself caring far too much about some of my characters, and it can be tough when I know I'm about to put one of them through a difficult time. If it's emotionally rough for them, it's emotionally rough for me, and I've often found myself trembling, or even in tears, at the end of a particularly troubling scene. This wouldn't be so bad, but I'm usually somewhere embarrassingly public - maybe on a train or in a café - when it happens!Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I read all sorts of different things, so there are quite a few authors in the frame. My crime favourites are always changing, but I'd have to mention Erin Kelly (The Poison Tree), Ann Cleeves (Raven Black), and Phil Hogan (A Pleasure And A Calling). Outside the crime genre, I love reading early John Le Carré, Philip K Dick, Terry Pratchett and J R R Tolkien.How has your life changed since becoming a published author?I thought that being a published author might make me feel more confident about my writing but, if anything, it's just made me even more anxious and insecure. Previously, I didn't have to worry, because I never expected anyone to actually read my books; there's a bit more pressure now. It's not all bad though. I have more Twitter followers now - I'm @fergusmcneill in case you were wondering - and I love chatting with readers so that's a genuine silver lining!If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'Not Enough Time. Not Enough Cake.'What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Don't give up! When you're on the outside, it's easy to imagine that there's a secret formula to being published, or some special technique, but there absolutely isn't. The same submission that gets you a three-book-deal has probably gathered a pile of rejection slips first. Just keep going. Good writers that do, always seem to break through eventually,.And lastly, why should people read your latest book?I started wondering what might happen if someone wished their life was more like yours - exactly like yours - and what might happen if they lived right upstairs from you. The result is Cut Out, a psychological thriller, featuring my Bristol-based detective Inspector Harland. I really hope people enjoy it.About Fergus McNeillAs well as writing crime novels, Fergus McNeill has been creating computer games since the early eighties, writing his first interactive fiction titles while still at school.

She has to find out who they are and what happened to them.For Marnie, there is no other darkness than this...My verdictNo Other Darkness is a gripping police procedural. Sarah Hilary isn't afraid to tackle dark story lines and complex relationships. The book explores the impact that violent crime and murder have on people's families and relationships - and the difficulties associated with moving on with life afterwards.The plot is a sensitive story involving the discovery of the bodies of two young children, who were abandoned in an underground bunker five years earlier. The children's bodies were found in the garden of Terry and Beth Doyle who have a young family themselves, as well as a teenage foster son. DI Marnie Rome and her team need to establish the murdered children's identities before they can look for the perpetrator of this terrible crime.This fast-moving page turner draws you in from the disturbing prologue. The short chapters keep you reading; it's easy to say just one more chapter and then discover that you have read three or four. The twists and turns keep on coming right until the end, with plenty of surprises for the reader.Sarah Hilary writes in a highly emotive way; you don't just read what's happening - you can feel it too. DI Rome and her team feel strong emotions for their victims, and their humanity is a central part of the story. The main characters have complicated backgrounds, but they remain realistic and believable.This is the second in Sarah Hilary's Marnie Rome series. I haven't yet read the first book (although I had already bought it before I received this one). I had no problems understanding the characters or story, and this can easily be read as a standalone.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "The Art of Staying Dead by Joel Hames", "date": "Friday 22 May 2015", "text": "The Art of Staying DeadBy Joel HamesKindle edition available from Amazon UK (27 May 2015)Publisher's descriptionA prisoner who doesn't exist.A lawyer who doesn't care.A secret buried for thirty years.Sam Williams' idea of an important decision is whether to have another kebab for lunch. He's spent ten years running away from other people's pain, and he's learned not to look back. Sam needs a client, and for a human rights lawyer with a flexible conscience and an impatient landlord, a high security prison seems a decent bet to find one. But now the bodies are mounting up, the decisions are getting serious, and the pain isn't someone else's any more.Someone wants him dead, the police would like a word, and there's nowhere left in London to hide. If Sam wants to stay alive, he's going to have to stop running and figure out why.My verdictSam Williams could have been a hot shot lawyer until his career went pear shaped. Now, he's trudging through life with a fear of commitment and taking cases from the dregs of society - whatever he can find to make some money. But this changes when  an incident in a high security prison throws his life into turmoil.The Art of Staying Dead is a well-planned thriller full of conspiracy, politics, murder and violence. The highly descriptive plot sucks you straight into the action from the first page. After the first chapter, the plot then slows down and the story gradually unfolds, leading to several twists and a satisfying conclusion.Since the book is written in the first person, you get right into Sam's thoughts and feelings, which makes the story come alive. Unlike other protagonists in books with a similar theme, Sam isn't a natural action hero. He can be pretty clueless and disorganised at times, and his thoughts generally run away with him. This means that the writing can be a little wordy in places, but it fits in well with his character.If you enjoy action thrillers, with political intrigue and a slightly more masculine feel, then this is an ideal book for you.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the author in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Elizabeth Forbes", "date": "Thursday 21 May 2015", "text": "I am delighted that ELIZABETH FORBES is joining me on my blog today. Elizabeth's two books - Nearest Thing to Crazy and Who Are You - are both brilliant psychological thrillers published by Cutting Edge Press. So Lizzie, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?Hi Vicki, and thanks for inviting me onto your Q&A. That's a difficult question. I can't think of anything in particular that inspired me to write, to be honest. I think I just felt the need to express myself in words on paper. I don't know whether other people do this, but I used to dream I was writing stories. And I used to annoy everyone by usually guessing the twists in movies and TV dramas, and imagining what I would do with the characters if I was telling their stories. Then when my children were very young, I was at home with a typewriter (shows how long ago that was!) wondering how to keep myself occupied, so I started to write my first novel just to see 'where it would go'.Where do your ideas come from?Maybe something that happens to people around me; perhaps stories in the newspapers or general themes that I think would be interesting to investigate and develop. In Nearest Thing to Crazy, I was interested in the notion of truth in storytelling and the way we all have our own versions of what is the truth. For example, we can go to the same party and have entirely different experiences and recollections of what 'actually' happened. And as it says in the beginning of the book, 'memory can play strange tricks…' So I decided to pitch two narrators against each other and attempt to have the reader not really knowing who to believe. I think this happens in real life. People exaggerate, or add light and shade, or maybe hold back on something that was uncomfortable, so we have a picture, but perhaps not the whole story, of what happened.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?Well, I suppose the fact that I've been through two divorces means that I know how it feels when a relationship is under pressure; and I have experienced living with a husband with a terminal illness, so life hasn't always been easy for me or my children. I think I can tap into those feelings of despair when life is falling apart around you, and I'm just fascinated by the power of the human spirit. Whatever adversity life puts in one's way, our natural instinct is to try and survive it somehow. In Who Are You?, I wanted to explore this survival instinct and the way the mind attempts to deal with trauma, perhaps through denial, or by becoming a kind of artificially constructed 'self' that convinces itself it's OK when actually it isn't at all, if that makes sense!Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Twisty, dark, sometimes drily funny (hopefully) in spare, transparent prose. (At least that's how I'd like it to be!)Do you have any strange writing habits?Err, sometimes I have two Jack Russells peering over the keyboard as I type or sitting on my arms, which makes life difficult. I stuff bananas and drink cappuccino coffee from my lovely Nespresso machine. I also have a constant supply of nicotine lozenges and e-cigarettes. I'd love to say I get up at 4am and do four hours work before breakfast, but I'm far too lazy. I procrastinate for hours, play on Facebook and Twitter, surf the internet for research and then eventually face the blank sheet of paper. Ideally I need to have long, interrupted time when the book's in full flow so that I can get into the writing mindset and hope that the characters will start to talk to me. I become seriously anti-social, protecting my writing space by avoiding the phone and praying friends won't drop in unexpectedly. And then I just pray that they'll still be around when it's over.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?I have an idea of the theme, the main characters and the basic arc of the story, but I don't do a detailed plot. I prefer not to know how the book will end, because I feel I would subconsciously give away too many hints along the way. And part of the excitement for me is a bit like reading a book: you've got to keep going in order to know how it will end. The downside is that it does make it a bit 'seat of the pants'. I find that however I thought the story was going to progress, it always seems to develop a mind of its own and surprises me.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Overall there's the overriding fear that every word I write is rubbish and nobody will be remotely interested in reading such drivel. Then there's the thinking of the plot, and trying to develop characters and scenes that will move the story forward and keep the reader both involved and satisfied. I wish I had a better imagination and could be one of those writers who has a clear idea of the whole story from beginning to end, with all the bits in-between. But for me, it's like pulling teeth. And when it's all finished, there's the awful post-exam-waiting-for-the-results thing, when you have to wait for the verdict of success or failure. But when the book gets a good reception, it's like giving birth - all the pain's forgotten until the next time.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?I had to read a lot of the classics when I was doing my literature degree, and I adored Henry James, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy and Joseph Conrad; and Jane Eyre is one of my all-time favourites. The contemporary writers I love include J.M. Coetzee because his prose is clean and pure. It makes me tingle because it's just so perfect. And I love Caroline Smailes because she is brilliant and pushes the boundaries with her novels. I really enjoyed reading Harriet Lane's psychological thrillers because I admire the sense of subtle menace lurking below a seemingly normal domestic environment which she creates. I like Louise Doughty for the same reason. And I read Do No Harm by Henry Marsh, which I thought was both beautifully written and one of the most moving books I've ever read. Ian McEwan, Kazuo Ishiguro, Patrick Gale, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Patrick Suskind are all favourites - I could go on and on because basically I pretty much like everything and anything as long as it's well-written.How has your life changed since becoming a published author?It's a mixture of excitement and terror. It's an amazing feeling to have my books in print, and to have people tell me how much they've enjoyed them. I still find it all a bit unbelievable. I'm grateful to anyone who's put the time aside to actually read one of my books. The downside is the agony of fearing that everyone will hate my next book and I'll never, ever be able to write another one. But I'm hoping that this comes with the territory and most writers feel the same way. At least that's what I keep telling myself. I've got to mention THE Book Club on Facebook, which has been a massive support to me - I've been able to connect with lots of readers and receive some really positive feedback, which helps to keep me focused on the next project.If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?Ha ha - 'Four Wedding and a Funeral' (with apologies to Richard Curtis). Or 'I Just Kept Buggering On'.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Try and write as unselfconsciously as possible and pretend that no one will ever read your wip (work in progress) so you can try to put those horrible feelings of self-doubt aside and just get on with the writing. Just get the words on paper; then at least you'll have something to work with and revise later on. Writing just a few hundred words every day will eventually add up to a full-blown novel. The book won't write itself! Read everything you can - people who write in the same genre, classics, biography, anything. Be a sponge, ready to soak up every experience. And when you're going through a bad one, stay positive because it just might come in useful sometime.And lastly, why should people read your books?Ooh, that's a tricky one for me to answer. So can I duck out and just quote the fabulous book blogger Anne Cater: 'Her writing is chillingly unsettling; tense and cleverly paced. Prepare yourself to be consumed by this story, to be terrified and at the same time to empathise with the hidden victims of other people's actions. A triumph!' I couldn't ask for a better plug than that, could I?About Elizabeth ForbesElizabeth Forbes lives with her husband in Herefordshire near the Welsh Border.

His suspicions put him on the trail of a mysterious young woman who appears to have been present at each scene of the years-long string of 'accidents' and murders, and who may well be that most rare of killers: a female serial.Roarke's hunt for her takes him across three states, while in a small coastal town, a young father and his five-year-old son, both wounded from a recent divorce, encounter a lost and compelling young woman on the beach and strike up an unlikely friendship without realising how deadly she may be.As Roarke uncovers the shocking truth of her background, he realises she is on a mission of her own, and must race to capture her before more blood is shed.My verdictHuntress Moon is an exceptionally well-plotted crime thriller exploring the fine line between good and evil.Investigating a series of murders, FBI Special Agent Matthew Roarke believes that a serial killer is on the loose. It seems that the highly skilled killer is a woman, yet female serial killers are virtually unheard of. On the surface, the Huntress appears to be a cold, calculating character, but it's possible that there could be more to her than meets the eye. As the story unfolds, it appears that she is on a mission - and is determined that nothing will get in her way.The book dives straight into the action and doesn't stop, with its fast-paced descriptions and snappy dialogue.  For me, the characters really came alive as the Huntress and Roarke pit their wits against each other. The tension builds up and the two characters get closer to colliding - and when they do, it's quite explosive.By alternating chapters between the two main protagonists, the author has created an intriguing cat and mouse chase that grabbed my attention all the way through. I didn't want the book to end, so it's just as well there are another two in the series.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

All profits will go towards funding a wide variety of research into Crohn's disease.Publisher's descriptionBook forCrohns is a 'community in a book' - a one-stop shop for anyone with Crohn's disease, their family, friends and loved ones. It covers all the expected topics such as diagnosis, drugs and surgery whilst also exploring more lifestyle-related topics - having a relationship when you have Crohn's, having children or a career when you have the condition. In addition, there is a chapter written by and for children and young people with Crohn's, and an entire section written by and for the relatives and loved ones of the condition.Throughout the book, a wide range of medical professionals have written in layman's terms about their area of expertise. Every chapter has numerous real life accounts directly from those with the donation, commented on by a medical expert and each chapter brings you tips and suggestions from those who know best.About Crohn's diseaseCrohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bowel. It affects around 115,000 people in the UK, most commonly starting between the ages of 15 and 40 and then later at age 60. The symptoms vary in severity and usually flare up and down, but often include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea and unintentional weight loss. Some people also experience fever, fatigue and feeling sick or actual vomiting. In around half of Crohn's patients, the disease progresses to a more severe form, with narrowing of the bowel and blockages carrying a risk of infection. People with Crohn's are at an increased risk of nutritional deficiencies, leading to anaemia and/or osteoporosis. Common treatments include antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, specialised diets and possibly surgery.My verdictBook for Crohns is an essential reference guide for anyone living with Crohn's disease, whether you have the condition yourself, you are a friend or family member or a healthcare professional in the field. The book is packed full of easy-to-read information, with well-explained medical jargon and scientific terms.Book for Crohns has three main sections. The first section is devoted to Crohn's disease from a medical point of view, covering the symptoms, treatment, management and living with the disease. The second section looks at Crohn's disease from the point of view of those with the condition, with case studies and testimonies on coping with the diagnosis, having surgery, following nutrition and diet advice and dealing with everyday life situations (e.g. at work, relationships and having children). Alongside these stories, there are relevant facts and guidance from key healthcare professionals. There are also lists of practical tips and suggestions to help you cope with having Crohn's disease. The third section, Crohn's disease from the loved ones, contains experiences of partners and family members. There are also two short chapters covering 'What the future holds' and 'Links and further information'.If you have been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, or know someone who has, this is an ideal book to give you reliable background information and practical advice.

Imagine if Adolf Hitler never came to power in Germany and ended up in London instead, living as a low-life private investigator with the dregs of society.There are two stories here. Firstly, that of Shomer, an inmate suffering cruel hardships and the threat of the gas chamber at Auschwitz. And secondly (taking up most of the book) that of 'Wolf' in London, who exists purely in Shomer's imagination.The book is dark and completed twisted. The vivid descriptions and subject matter are shocking in places, but I found this to be highly addictive reading. I don't often read the historical notes at the back of a book, but I did so in this case, as I wanted to know more about the background of the story.This isn't your average holocaust-themed book and is certainly not for the faint-hearted. But this is an ideal read if you don't mind graphic and disturbing fiction, and are looking for something very different and completely original.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Bookbridgr, in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHT - Angela Marsons", "date": "Friday 15 May 2015", "text": "AUTHOR IN THE SPOTLIGHTis a new Q&A feature on my blogI am delighted that ANGELA MARSONS is joining me on my blog for my first author interview. Angela is one of my favourite new authors. Both of her DI Kim Stone books - Silent Scream and Evil Games (out on 29th May 2015) - are published by Bookouture. So Angela, what inspired you to write a book in the first place?The first book I wrote was about alcoholism. I was fascinated by the ability of the disease to attach itself to any gender or class. This grew into the novel about a friendship between two very different women who are brought together during their recovery.Where do your ideas come from?Normally, they come from a subject that fascinates me. Silent Scream came from my intrigue in a children's home when I was a teenager. Evil Games was born from my interest in the sociopathic personality.Have your personal experiences influenced your writing? And if so, how?I think my writing has grown with me. I always wanted to explore emotions and tell stories, but I think now I appreciate the need to treat subjects with the respect they deserve. For example, in Silent Scream I wanted to depict the condition of muscular dystrophy with accuracy and the same with autism in Evil Games. I think earlier in the writing life, I might not have been so diligent.Describe your writing style in 10 words or less?Oh, excellent question. I would call it: 'Intensely fast-paced stories with unforgettable characters'.Do you have any strange writing habits?Not so much strange habits, but I do like to start a project with a whole new set of exercise books and pencils bought especially for the occasion. I suppose that's just the symbolic start of a whole new journey.Do you plot out the whole book before you start or just start writing and see where it leads you?When I start writing I have a vague idea of where I want it to go, but that's subject to change. I love the plot to grow organically as I'm writing the story so that even I don't know where it will end. I once tried planning a book thoroughly and by chapter three I was bored to death. So I knew that method wouldn't work for me.What do you consider to be the hardest part of your writing?Tackling difficult subjects but I won't shy away from them because I don't like them. There are scenes that I have found upsetting to write, but I try to treat each subject with sensitivity and respect and without sensationalism.Do you read? If so, who are your favourite authors?My favourite authors are Karin Slaughter, Carol O Connell, Val McDermid and a James Patterson now and again.How has your life changed since becoming a published author?Oh wow, where to start. I have met so many wonderful people throughout this journey who I now count as good friends. I have been given the unbelievable opportunity to focus on writing full time, which is a dream come true. To be able to call something you do second only to breathing your job is like no feeling on earth. And I even bought an iPhone!If you were writing a book about your life, what would be the title?'Mind Your Own Business.' This has been a common thread throughout my life so far. It started at school and has lasted until now. It's a phrase I hear a lot. But I always want to know the details. I want to why, who, how of everything. And it's probably unlikely to change.What advice do you have for aspiring writers?Never stop writing and never forget why you do it in the first place. Never allow rejection letters to overshadow your passion to tell a story. Also, there's an old adage - 'Write about what you know'. I'm not sure that's right, especially if you're writing about crime or serial killers! I would advise you to write about something that interests you. It will show in your work.And lastly, why should people read your next book?Evil Games features a female sociopath and an epic cat-and-mouse game between two very intelligent women. But has Kim Stone met her match this time?About Angela MarsonsAngela lives in the Black Country with her partner, their bouncy Labrador and potty-mouthed parrot. Visit Angela's website to learn more or follow her on Twitter.Read my review of Silent Scream here My review of Evil Games will be coming very soon. Here's a taster of my verdict: 'Evil Games is certainly as good as the first DI Kim Stone book [Silent Scream], if not better, and I wish I could give it a higher rating than 5/5.'"},
{"title": "A Place Called Winter by Patrick Gale", "date": "Sunday 10 May 2015", "text": "A Place Called WinterBy Patrick GalePublished by Tinder Press (26 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1472205292Publisher's descriptionIn the golden 1900s, Harry Cane, a shy, eligible gentleman of leisure, is drawn from a life of quiet routine into courting and marrying Winnie, eldest daughter of the fatherless Wells clan, who are not quite as respectable as they would appear. They settle by the sea and have a daughter, and conventional marriage does not seem such a tumultuous change after all. When a chance encounter awakens scandalous desires never acknowledged until now, however, Harry is forced to forsake the land and people he loves for a harsh new life as a homesteader on the newly colonised Canadian prairies. There, in a place called Winter, he will come to find a deep love within an alternative family, a love imperiled by war, madness and an evil man of undeniable magnetism.My verdictA Place Called Winter is a passionate and powerful novel written by a gifted storyteller. I admit that I haven't read a Patrick Gale book before, but will certainly now be checking out his other novels.Set in the early 20th century, the book follows the path of a man called Harry Cane.  It's emotional and tragic, with beautiful descriptive passages and sensitive, tender writing. It's a story of forbidden love set against a backdrop of remote Canadian farmlands.The reader first meets Harry as a patient in a Canadian psychiatric hospital. The book then jumps back and forth in time to uncover the reasons behind his confinement.Harry is born into a privileged lifestyle in England. He is a shy, gentle man, whose naivety leads him to put too much trust and faith in other people. Following a passionate affair, he is forced to leave his wife and child and seek a new life in Canada.I read A Place Called Winter in one sitting. This is a moving tale of hardship, violence, determination, betrayal, pride and triumph. It's not always an easy read, but it's certainly a fascinating one.I received a digital Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review, but also treated myself to the hardback as it's such a stunning book (in more ways than one)."},
{"title": "The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins", "date": "Friday 8 May 2015", "text": "The Girl on the TrainBy Paula HawkinsPublished by Doubleday (15 January 2015)ISBN: 978-0857522313Publisher's descriptionRachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cosy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She's even started to feel like she knows them. \"Jess and Jason,\" she called them. Their life - as she sees it - is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.And then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves in, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?My verdictNot many readers of popular fiction won't have heard of The Girl on the Train over the last few months. Following all of the media attention the book has received, I felt that I needed to read it for myself to see what all the fuss is about.Rachel - the girl on the train - takes the same two journeys every day. To pass the time, she makes up stories about the people she sees on her route, developing an obsession with a particular couple, whom she calls Jess and Jason. The couples' real names are Megan and Scott. They live in the same road as Rachel's ex-husband (Tom), his wife Anna and their baby. When Megan goes missing, Rachel believes that she saw something important on her train journey, but she isn't the most reliable witness.The Girl on the Train starts off fairly slowly before picking up speed. There are three narrators - Rachel, Megan and Anna. The narrative switches from their different viewpoints and from past to present, and this is clearly marked at the beginning of each chapter/section.While I enjoyed the book overall, I still couldn't see what all of the hype is about. Yes it's well-written, compulsive reading, but no more than some other psychological thrillers I have read recently (many of which I preferred). The writing really draws you in, and the author has captured Rachel's battle with addiction particularly well.The Girl on the Train has been compared to Gone Girl and I can see why. The characters are largely unpleasant and/or damaged, which is the draw of both books. In both cases, the story builds up gradually as you read, and there are several twists and turns along the way.Gone Girl fans will probably love The Girl on the Train - unfortunately I'm not one of them. Yet I would still recommend this book to anyone who also wants to see what the hype is about - they may love The Girl on the Train far more than me. It's a really 'Marmite' book."},

I was then expecting the book to develop into a psychological thriller, but found it to be a thought-provoking novel instead. It covers controversial and topical issues, particularly teenagers, sex and relationships and the dangers of social media. It's disturbing in places and not a comfortable read.The book focuses on two very flawed families. I didn't particularly like any of the characters, but then I'm not sure that the reader is meant to. The characters are all troubled in one way or another, leading to complex relationships within (and between) the families themselves.There are a lot of references to neuroscience and psychology, to explain teenage behaviour and addiction. Although some of this was interesting, at times I felt that it detracted away from the story, slowing it down too much. Overall, The Good Girl certainly makes you think. It's an intriguing book about privacy and trust, and how actions and events have consequences that may spiral out of control.

The miraculous sole survivor is a three-month-old baby girl. Two families, one rich, the other poor, step forward to claim her, sparking an investigation that will last for almost two decades. Is she Lyse-Rose or Emilie?Eighteen years later, having failed to discover the truth, private detective Credule Grand-Duc plans to take his own life, but not before placing an account of his investigation in the girl's hands. But, as he sits at his desk, about to pull the trigger, he uncovers a secret that changes everything - then is killed before he can breathe a word of it to anyone...My verdictIn After the Crash, a baby is the sole survivor of a plane crash. No one can identify exactly who she is, as all photos and medical records were destroyed. She could belong to one of two families as two babies were known to be on board the flight. A private investigator spends 18 years trying to discover the truth.Overall I enjoyed the book. The story is certainly original and fascinating. It's a little unbelievable in places, with action scenes, murders, bizarre characters etc., and some questions were left unanswered. However, I just went with the flow, determined to discover the baby's identity.After the Crash has been translated well, although there's a substantial amount of background information at the beginning to wade through. There are some good twists and turns and the identity of the baby came as a surprise. I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

In the present day, Jane has changed her name and made a new life for herself in Wales. But the past is now coming back to haunt her. Someone knows the truth and she no longer knows who to trust.The story switches between the present day in Wales and the past in Nepal. All four women are believable characters, although not necessarily likeable. The author describes the ups and downs of their complex relationships brilliantly, and shows just how easy it is for the bonds of friendship to be manipulated and severed so quickly.I read The Lie in two sittings and found it difficult to put down.

But the search for a fresh start isn't as easy as they'd imagined.And they soon discover that it doesn't matter where you are or who you are - if you can't lay the past to rest, coincidence, fate and deception have a way of catching up with you when you least expect it.My verdictI loved John Marr's first book The Wronged Sons. Yet again he has scored a winner.Welcome To Wherever You Are consists of several interwoven stories of backpackers staying at the Venice Beach International Hostel in Los Angeles. Each of these fascinating characters has secrets that are gradually revealed as the book switches between present and past.The story is filled with little clues about who the people are and why they find themselves at the hostel. With short chapters and snappy dialogue, the author teasingly pulls the reader along with carefully worded snippets of information. I couldn't put the book down, and loved it from start to finish. All of the characters are really well developed and the intricate plot is so well constructed, something many other authors fail to achieve successfully.As the story progresses, there's more and more interaction between some of the different characters in the past and present. The book is shocking in places, but still fantastic. Revelations just keep on coming. Some I suspected while others were a complete surprise.Welcome To Wherever You Are is sheer brilliance.

Is there a copycat killer at work? Was the wrong man convicted? Or is there something more sinister at play …With her mother's terrifying legacy spiralling out of control, Jennifer must look into her own dark past in a fight not only to stop a killer - but to save herself and those she loves.My verdictDon't Turn Around is exactly as it describes itself - a supernatural thriller. It's certainly not run-of-the mill. The book is creepy, intriguing and an enjoyable read.The story focuses on DC Jennifer Knight and her mother Elizabeth, who was also in the police force. A series of murders in the present day bear a startling resemblance to a series of killings in the past, and Jennifer is convinced that there is a link between the two.Jennifer is a great character, trying to keep herself together as she becomes plagued by voices from beyond the grave. She has a special connection with her partner Will, and there's good banter between them, which brings some humour into the story.The book flows well, with powerful descriptive language, and builds up to a terrifying conclusion. I love how the link between the past and the present grows more obvious as the book progresses but still keeps you guessing until the end.Without giving away any spoilers, the ending of the book sets itself up very well as the start of a series, so I look forward to seeing how the characters and stories develop over time.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Keith Nixon's The Corpse Role, which was published in Kindle edition on 10 April 2015 by Gladius Press.The Corpse RoleBy Keith NixonPublished in Kindle edition by Gladius Press (10 April 2015)Published in paperback edition by CreateSpace (18 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1508933502Publisher's descriptionNot everything that gets buried stays buried… sometimes things have a nasty habit of resurfacing…When the body of a security van driver implicated in an unsolved £1.2 million heist turns up in a shallow grave two years later, it's just the beginning for Detective Inspector Charlotte Granger. She embarks on an investigation that takes her into dangerous territory - a world of dirty cops, dodgy private investigators, local villains and nosy journalists. Meanwhile events from Granger's own past are threatening to come back and haunt her.As people are killed to silence them and vital information vanished from files, can DI Granger get to the truth. And if she does, what will that truth reveal?My verdictThis enjoyable police procedural is a tale of police corruption and how the past comes back to haunt those involved. It is well written, with fast-paced descriptions, a hard-hitting plot, great characters and unexpected twists and turns.DI Charlotte Granger is called when a body is discovered in a shallow grave. The murder victim is connected to a former police officer, now turned private investigator (PI). Both the victim and the PI are linked to a bank robbery that took place two years earlier. DI Granger tries to discover the truth about the murder victim, but has her hands full as the dead bodies start piling up.The Corpse Role deals with gangsters and dodgy dealings. The narrative switches between the present and the past. You are given very few clues about the narrator in the past, which adds to the intrigue and keeps you guessing about their identity all the way through the book. I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.About the authorKeith Nixon has been writing since he was a child.

She loves her granddad and her sister and her shiny new red shoes.She's just been abducted by a killer - someone who kidnaps young girls, holds them for a few weeks, then returns their bodies clothed in white foundling dresses.The crimes are clearly linked to notorious child murderer Louis Kinsella, locked away in a high-security hospital. Is it a copycat? Or is he giving someone direct orders from behind bars?To save Ella's life, psychologist Alice Quentin must form a relationship with Kinsella. But he is slow to give up his secrets, and all the while, time is running out ...My verdictThe Winter Foundlings is the third book in the Alice Quentin series. I haven't read the first two books (which has shocked me, as this book was so good). But this didn't spoil my enjoyment at all and anyone could read this as a standalone.This excellent thriller is creepy and filled with nail-biting suspense. It's brilliantly written and well constructed. I could tell that the author had researched her subject well. The story flows along at a steady pace and keeps you guessing until the end. The little twists and turns keep up the momentum and try (successfully in my case) to steer you in the wrong direction.I love Alice's character - she's feisty and determined and has a complex past, yet remains realistic and very likeable. The short chapters from young Ella's point of view are sad, chilling and disturbing in places, so may not appeal to the faint hearted.I recommend The Winter Foundlings to any crime fiction fan who likes their book to have interesting characters and an in-depth well-researched story.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review."},

So why did they disappear overnight?Joe and Christy Davenport's dreams come true when they buy their perfect house on sought-after Lime Park Road. And they happily overlook the fact that the previous owners seem to have fled overnight.But once moved in, Christy witnesses strange behaviour from her new neighbours. One of whom is Doug Whalen, reclusive, unkempt and aggressive. And the more Christy's attempts at friendship are met with silence, the more she's convinced the only way to discover the truth about Lime Park Road is by unpicking the shocking story of her predecessors, Jeremy Fraser and his glamorous wife Amber.My verdictThe Sudden Departure of the Frasers is a story about secrets in suburbia. The quest for the perfect home. Life with twitching curtains. A place where everyone knows, or tries to know, each other's business.The book focuses on two women - Christy and Amber. Christy and her husband Joe have just moved into their 'forever' home in Lime Park Road, a highly sought-after location, but they find that the neighbours don't want to know them. Something obviously happened there, and Christy is desperate to discover what it was. Amber and her husband Jeremy lived in the house before them, but left in a hurry and no one knows where they are. So what is the secret that all the neighbours are determined to hide?The book alternates between Amber and Christy's stories, building up to the final reveal. I found myself comparing these two women, their husbands and their lives. It is cleverly written, because the other characters - especially the mysterious Joe - come across very differently, depending on whether you are reading Christy or Amber's chapters.Overall, The Sudden Departure of the Frasers is an enjoyable read that keeps you guessing to the end. However, it's a slow burner, so not for people who are expecting a fast-paced psychological thriller. And the secret wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, which was a slight disappointment after all the build up.I received a copy from the publisher through NetGalley and also through the Lovereading Reviewer Panel in exchange for an honest review."},

Olek Volchek, the infamous head of the Russian mafia in New York, has strapped a bomb to Eddie's back and kidnapped his ten-year-old daughter Amy.Eddie only has forty-eight hours to defend Volchek in an impossible murder trial - and win - if he wants to save his daughter.Under the scrutiny of the media and the FBI, Eddie must use his razor-sharp wit and every con-artist trick in the book to defend his 'client' and ensure Amy's safety. With the timer on his back ticking away, can Eddie convince the jury of the impossible?Lose this case and he loses everything.My verdictThe Defence is a fast-paced thriller. So fast, there's little time to pause and think. The short sentences, paragraphs and chapters and the snappy dialogue keep the book flowing from beginning to end. I felt quite exhausted (in a good way) by the last page.Yes the plot is cliched, in fact totally ludicrous at times. There are good guys, bad guys, action scenes with plenty of suspense, twists and turns ... But that just makes the book more appealing. And I loved the ending (don't worry, no spoilers - you will have to find out for yourself).Eddie is a brilliant character, with a sense of morality despite his dodgy past - and I look forward to hearing more from him (and the author) very soon.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley and won the audiobook in a competition through the author. I read parts of the book and listened to the rest. Due to the short snappy chapters, and dialogue that reads like a film script, The Defence works very well as an audiobook."},

Her life is reduced to a piano which makes music but no sound, a forest where all that grows is a means of survival. And a tiny wooden hut that is Everything.My verdictOur Endless Numbered Days is a beautifully-written tale, filled with mesmerising descriptions and haunting prose.At the age of eight, Peggy is taken away from London by her survivalist father James to a remote part of Europe. He tells her that the rest of the world has come to end and that her concert pianist mother has died. With all the wonder and innocence of childhood, Peggy believes him and puts all her faith in her father's ability to keep her safe. They move into a ramshackle mountain hut, scavenging for food and struggling to survive in the cruel, harsh environment.At the centre of the story is a silent piano, which James builds for Peggy, and Peggy's determination to learn how to play it. As the story progresses, her father descends further and further into madness.The book is narrated by 17-year-old Peggy, who has now returned to civilisation after nine years in the forest. Obviously Peggy gets older during her story, but at times she doesn't appear to age at all - still viewing life with the naivety of an eight-year-old girl.

Buying the same clothes, going through his post, his things. Becoming Matt without him ever knowing.And it would have been all right, if Matt hadn't brought the girl home.When things spiral out of control, Detective Inspector Harland has to unravel the disturbing truth. But there's far more to the case than meets the eye...My verdictCut Out is a clever mix of psychological thriller and police procedural. This is the first DI Harland novel that I have read, but is the third in the series. It was easy to read as a standalone, although I now plan to read the first two books.The book is cleverly organised into sections - three months earlier, one month ago and two weeks ago interspersed with the present - which makes it very easy to follow and a pleasure to read.The past, and build up to the present, focuses on Nigel and his fixation with his neighbour Matt, whose girlfriend Laura has vanished. Nigel wants to be Matt - he moves his furniture around to match Matt's flat, buys new clothes (just like Matt's) and breaks into Matt's flat to spy on him.The other sections of the book - the present - focus on DI Harland and his team, who are searching for missing Laura. There's also the murder of a local drug dealer that needs to be resolved, although DI Harland has been taken off the case to investigate Laura's disappearance. Could the cases be linked?Cut Out is a brilliant novel. It's well written and fast paced, with various twists and turns. I read it in one sitting, which for me is the sign of a great book. I really liked the characters (even Nigel - I actually started to feel sorry for him, which is ridiculous as he was clearly insane!) and found the stalking plot to be a fascinating read.I received a copy from the publisher through the Lovereading Reviewer Panel in exchange for an honest review. http://www.lovereading.co.uk/book/14096/Cut-Out-by-Fergus-McNeill.html"},

Normal is the first book I have read that gives you an insight into the mind of a serial killer - and I loved every minute of it.Normal's villain is a loveable rogue, who just happens to be a serial killer. He is smooth talking, completely adorable, but also evil. He kills people at random, although doesn't seem to get much pleasure from it. I couldn't decide whether to love him or hate him.This is a brilliantly written fast-paced novel and I read it in one evening. I don't give spoilers in my reviews, so can't say too much, but some of the book had me in fits of laughter (which felt so wrong, as serial killers are certainly no laughing matter).If you're looking for a straightforward psychological thriller, then this isn't for you.

She served her time. But what if they lied?I have no memory of what happened but I was told I killed my son. And you believe what your loved ones, your doctor and the police tell you, don't you?My name is Emma Cartwright. Three years ago I was Susan Webster, and I murdered my twelve-week-old son Dylan. I was sent to Oakdale Psychiatric Institute for my crime, and four weeks ago I was released early on parole with a new identity, address and a chance to rebuild my shattered life.This morning, I received an envelope addressed to Susan Webster. Inside it was a photograph of a toddler called Dylan. Now I am questioning everything I believe because if I have no memory of the event, how can I truly believe he's dead?If there was the smallest chance your son was alive, what would you do to get him back?My verdictWow - what an emotional roller coaster. How I lost You made me smile, cry, worry and breathe a sigh of relief throughout its 368 pages.This is the story of Susan Webster who was convicted of killing her baby son, Dylan. She can't remember much from that time, but certainly doesn't remembering wanting him dead. Susan has now been released from prison, after a three-year sentence, and is living under the name Emma Cartwright, desperately trying to make a new life for herself. But someone keeps sending packages to Susan Webster, telling her that her son is still alive.How I Lost You was a well-written fast-paced thriller. It kept me guessing all the way until its dark creepy end, when the final twists were revealed. Not everything in the story was realistic or believable, and I questioned at times how Susan/Emma could be so trusting after everything she had experienced.

She can't live a lie any more.The invitation goes out far and wide, calling her three children and their families back home to Winterfold, their rambling house in the heart of the English countryside. They are Bill, the doctor; Florence, the eccentric academic; and Daisy, the child who never fit in. As the story unfolds, each character reveals the secrets, joys, and tragedies they are wrestling with through the confines of the family. What will happen when Martha finally tells the truth?My verdictA Place For Us was a little slow at first, and a bit too long, but overall this was an easy read. The book cover is a beautiful watercolour painting of a house that I assume depicts Winterfold, where the story is set.Martha and David have invited their whole family to join them at Winterfold for her 80th birthday celebrations - but not everyone is able to join them. As the reunion takes place, and the story unfolds, family secrets are revealed.Each chapter is written from the point of view of one of the characters, sometimes in the present and sometimes in the past. This format was easy to follow as it switched from person to person. The characters are all very different; some of them seemed very normal and likeable (e.g. Cat and Lucy), but others were very odd (e.g. Florence and Daisy).A Place For Us was originally released in several parts. I won a copy of the first part of the book through a Goodreads giveaway and bought the rest of the book in its separate e-book parts. However, I then received the whole paperback from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review. I am actually pleased that I didn't read the book in parts, with a gap between them, as I would probably have been very confused by all of the characters."},
{"title": "Hidden by Emma Kavanagh - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Friday 17 April 2015", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Emma Kavanagh's second psychological thriller Hidden, which is being published on 23 April 2015 by Century.I would like to welcome Emma Kavanagh, who tells us what it's like being a published author. After graduating with a PhD in Psychology from Cardiff University, Emma Kavanagh spent seven years working as a police and military psychologist, training firearms officers, command staff and military personnel, throughout the UK and Europe, to deal with the most extreme situations. An expert in her field, she now applies her knowledge to her writing: creating realistic and incredibly tense stories.Over to Emma...Being Published: Life Beyond the Book DealI have been doing this for a couple of years now. Hidden is my second published book and I have just signed my second two-book deal with Arrow. One of the things that is becoming abundantly clear is that the vast majority of people have absolutely no clue what my job entails. None. NONE!People seem to be fairly evenly split between those who think that I trot out a book in a 20-minute sit-down and get paid millions for the privilege, and those who think that I work harder than the builders of the pyramids and get paid nothing (or even, get to pay to do it!).Yeah.No.I work pretty hard, although not pyramid-building hard. And in truth, the vast majority of my life is spent sitting, laptop on my knee, typing. There are other commitments that being published brings - things like writing for this lovely blog, for example! And these can often provide a nice little diversion from my life within my own head.I don't get paid millions. Sigh. I don't pay for my book to be published. (What??)I have a job. And like most other jobs, there are things that I must do and time parameters in which they must be done. I have a deadline for submission for book 3 (it's fine - it's AGES away!). Before that rolls about, I have to finish it, edit it myself until I am happy that it's as good as I alone can possibly make it, whilst still doing all of the other tasks that fall to a published author. I go on Twitter - a lot. This began as a way to get my name known but has become a lifeline. Writing can be a very solitary business and social media has allowed me to get to know a huge bunch of writers and to come to consider them friends.Occasionally I am allowed out of the house (not often) on research trips, to London for meetings with my agents and my publishers, and, when publication time rolls around, to do events. I LOVE these. And not just because I spend 11 months of the year staring at the same four walls. I get to talk to people and sometimes have drinks!As a writer seeking a publishing deal, it seems like the holy grail. That, once this is achieved, life will take on a beautifully rosy glow and all manner of things will be well. Now, don't get me wrong, it's awesome. AWESOME! However, there is still terror. Publication day is deeply exciting and simultaneously deeply traumatic. What if everyone hates it? What if no-one hates it because no-one reads it? Why do I have baby sick in my hair in my author photo? See? Trauma! Some people will tell you they adore your book and you will feel a little like an imposter, because it can't be you who has written this book they love. Some will tell you they hated it. And then you will cry.It's not a job for the faint of heart. It is, however, a job that I have dreamt of my whole life and one that I wouldn't swap for anything!Hidden by Emma Kavanagh,published by Century, hardback at £12.99My verdict: An excellent well-written character-led psychological thriller.Read my full review: http://off-the-shelfbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/hidden-by-emma-kavanagh.htmlRead an extract of Chapter 1: http://www.deadgoodbooks.co.uk/index.php/extract-hidden-emma-kavanagh/Find out moreFollow the Blog Tour: http://www.reviewedthebook.co.ukFollow Emma Kavanagh on Twitter: https://twitter.com/EmmaLK"},

But Dana was at Celia's house only a few hours ago. Celia wanted to show her a photo - a photo of Dana's husband with another women - and Dana has blank spots of what happened to the rest of the afternoon…This is a thriller that makes the reader question everything. Dana, we learn, has a history of mental illness and as she descends into another manic episode, the line between what actually happened and what she has imagined becomes blurred.My verdictThe Pocket Wife was a good psychological thriller.Dana is bipolar and off her medication.  Her neighbour is found murdered, and Dana appears to have been the last person to see her alive. Is Dana right to be worried about that afternoon in her neighbour's house or is her illness making her paranoid? She has no idea which memories are real and which have been fabricated by her fragile mind.I enjoyed The Pocket Wife, but found it to be an uncomfortable read in places as it explored Dana's mental illness, but this was due to the subject matter rather than the writing. As Dana's mental state declines, and a manic phase sets in, no one is there to support her and encourage her to seek help.It's up to Jack Moss, the detective in charge of the case, to put together the clues and discover what actually happened that day. I was a bit surprised by some of his actions at the end, as I thought he was the only honest and genuine character. I guessed (correctly) who the murderer was towards the end of the book, although I still had a niggling doubt until the last page.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

His involvement with a female witness resulted in her murder. Mike returns to work but he's a shadow of the detective he was a few months before. Bennett gets a desperate call from an old friend to say that her husband, retired colleague Mark Leech, has gone missing. Blood spatters found in the home suggest that she doesn't have long to find him.When Jane is sent to a site in Elmstead Woods, she stumbles upon a sinister murder scene. A tomb has been created, and the body she finds is not Mark's - as she dreaded and suspected - but that of missing university student, Maggie Hungerford. Her killer recorded her last moments, even providing an air supply which was only cut off when the game lost its thrill. Two men admit to having had a sexual relationship with Maggie. Both deny murder. Someone is lying. And Mark is still missing.When another tomb is discovered, an anonymous tip and mounting evidence suggest a disturbing link which threatens to derail both cases and let a murderer walk free. Lockyer is shocked into supporting Bennett on a case which becomes ever more ominous and dangerous as the investigation deepens. They know that their hunt is for a killer with a mind so twisted that he, or she, is likely to stop at nothing.My verdictNo Place to Die was a pleasure to read and a great crime thriller. I was hooked from the first page and found it difficult to put the book down until the end.There's plenty of police procedure, but this is interspersed with tense scenes and chilling chapters focusing on the victims. In No Place to Die, the victims are buried alive, watched closely by the captor until their final breath - this is a horrifying prospect for anyone, and Clare Donoghue describes the scenes vividly but not too gruesomely.I found DS Jane Bennett to be a likeable well-rounded character. She isn't perfect and struggles with balancing her private and professional lives. I couldn't decide whether or not I liked DI Mike Lockyer  - maybe I would know more about his character if I had read the first book before this one, as he was clearly suffering from the after-effects of a difficult case.The plot itself flowed well and at a fast pace. The author definitely kept me guessing until the end, and I wasn't expecting the final twist - brilliant!I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher and through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

It's a story about growing up, and about aching and ardent love. For swimming upstream means pursuing something the salmon cannot see: a dream.The Salmon Who Dared To Leap Higher is a wise, tender and inspiring modern fable about finding freedom and a harmony with nature we have either forgotten or lost in the binding realities of life.My verdictThe Salmon Who Dared To Leap Higher was a relaxing, comfortable read - a great way to unwind. It reminded me of a bedtime story, one to be shared from generation to generation. The type of book that parents (or grandparents) would read to their children (or grandchildren).This easy-to-read and well-translated book is beautifully illustrated, both inside and on the cover. It is a short book and reads like a modern fable as it follows the story of Silver Salmon, who makes his journey to his spawning ground and final destiny. Silver Salmon is different from the other salmon, not only because of his silvery scales but also because of his inquiring mind.The Salmon Who Dared To Leap Higher has underlying meanings about love, life, determination and destiny - that sometimes the easy way isn't the right way and it isn't the salmon's way either.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

But even he is in for a shock when his past catches up with him.My verdictI read Unravelling Oliver in one sitting, which is how I feel this book should ideally be read to keep up its momentum. There are no superfluous descriptions and there is no unnecessary dialogue. The book is fairly short for a novel, but it flows from beginning to end. I literally couldn't put it down.The book begins with Oliver, a successful author of children's books, giving his wife a savage beating - something he has never done before and will never do again - leaving her life hanging by a thread. But what has led to this event?Each chapter of the book is narrated by a different character. These are former friends, relatives and acquaintances who have come into contact with Oliver at different stages in his life, each one recounting their memories of him. It soon becomes clear that Oliver is cold, calculating, dangerous and manipulative. I was glued to the clues about his past as the plot unravels to reveal his life story. There are some excellent and unexpected twists and turns.This is an amazing debut novel and a book that I won't forget easily.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher and through NetGalley."},

There's a secret in the middle, but you have to carefully peel back all of the layers one by one before you can discover it. And even when you reach the prize, there's more to come.Catherine and her husband Robert have just moved house. Then a book appears on her bedside table - she doesn't recognise it and her husband and son deny leaving it there. When Catherine starts reading, she realises that the book is about her - and a secret from 20 years ago that only she should know.Disclaimer is well written and filled with suspense. The characters are, on the whole, believable (yet I found them also very unlikeable). The plot keeps flowing, as the past comes back to haunt Catherine and her family. I wanted to keep reading to discover the secret.This is a book about secrets, obsession and revenge, and how sometimes everything is not all that it seems. There are some brilliant twists and turns, each one more surprising than the next.Disclaimer is a brilliant well-conceived and well-executed thriller.HiddenBy Emma KavanaghPublished by Century (23 April 2015)ISBN: 978-1448184576Publisher's descriptionHE'S WATCHINGA gunman is stalking the wards of a local hospital. He's unidentified and dangerous, and has to be located. Urgently.Police Firearms Officer Aden McCarthy is tasked with tracking him down. Still troubled by the shooting of a schoolboy, Aden is determined to make amends by finding the gunman - before it's too late.SHE'S WAITINGTo psychologist Imogen, hospital should be a place of healing and safety - both for her, and her young niece who's been recently admitted. She's heard about the gunman, but he has little to do with her. Or has he?As time ticks down, no one knows who the gunman's next target will be. But he's there. Hiding in plain sight. Far closer than anyone thinks...My verdictHidden's first chapter hooked me from the outset with its fast-paced writing and dramatic scene. The book begins with the vivid description of the first few moments after a shooting spree at a hospital by a lone gunman. This is seen through the eyes of Charlie, a local reporter, who clearly knows some of the victims well. I found this to be an effective introduction to some of the key characters.Hidden jumps between timelines, building up to the day of the shooting.  I found this very easy to follow, as each chapter is clearly signposted with who is telling the story and when this is taking place. The book is written from four main viewpoints  - Charlie, Aden (a police firearms officer), Imogen (a psychologist) and the gunman - as it follows their journey to that fateful event. Several threads weave together as the tension builds up.Hidden has believable interesting characters, many of whom are linked in some way. We learn about their back stories, including that of the shooter, although the identity of the shooter isn't revealed until right at the end of the book. The author uses twists and turns to lead the reader off track, with several red herrings strategically placed throughout the book. I thought I had guessed who the shooter was on several occasions, but then changed my mind again as I continued to read.Emma Kavanagh is a former police psychologist. In Hidden, she has explored how different police officers react and cope with tragedies and life-and-death situations.This is an excellent well-written character-led psychological thriller.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Join me on Emma Kavanagh's Blog Tour on 17th April."},

Their little world comprises only the rooms in their home, each named for various exotic locales and filled with Will's art projects. But soon the confines of his world close in on him.Despite his mother's protests, Will ventures outside clad in a protective helmet and braces himself for danger. He eventually meets and befriends Jonah, a quiet boy who introduces him to skateboarding.Will welcomes his new world with enthusiasm, his fears fading and his body hardening with each new bump, scrape and fall. But life quickly gets complicated. When a local boy goes missing, Will and Jonah want to uncover what happened. They embark on an extraordinary adventure that pulls Will far from the confines of his closed-off world and into the throes of early adulthood and the dangers that everyday life offers.If I Fall, If I Die is a remarkable debut full of dazzling prose and unforgettable characters, as well as a poignant and heartfelt depiction of coming of age.My verdictI enjoyed the first half of If I Fall, If I Die, which starts off as the story of a boy exploring the outside world for the first time. Will has been stuck inside his home for all of his life (so far) with his mother Diane, who developed agoraphobia following the death of her parents and twin brother.Will has now turned 11 and wants to explore. He enrols at school, makes friends and discovers that the 'outside' is not as scary as his mother has led him to believe. At the same time, Diane has to learn to let him go.My interest lagged in the second half of the book. Will seeks adventure when one of his new friends disappears. I didn't find the mystery element grabbed my attention and the plotline involving Butler and his gang wasn't believable. These stories were then interweaved with what happened to Diane's brother.Overall, this was a well-written book, but I can only give it three stars. I would have enjoyed it more if the author had stuck to the story of Will and Diane, with her agoraphobia and twin brother, without going off track.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Lisa Jackson's Close to Home, which was published in paperback on 26 March 2015 by Mulholland Books (imprint of Hodder & Stoughton).READ MY REVIEWClose to HomeBy Lisa JacksonPublished by Mulholland Books (Hardback - 25 September 2014, Paperback - 26 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1-444-79330-7Publisher's descriptionThe home where Sarah McAdams grew up has always terrified her. But now she's moved back with her daughters, determined to put her childhood fears behind her.It's harder than she thought. Increasingly haunted by the past, Sarah soon realises that the present has its own threats. One by one, teenage girls are disappearing...Frantic for her daughter's safety, Sarah feels the house's walls closing in on her once more. Somewhere deep in her memory is the key to a very real danger.And only by confronting the terrifying truth can she protect her children from a nightmare that is roaring back to life...My verdictClose to Home is a suspense novel that kept me intrigued right until the last page. It contains mystery, some romance, teenage angst, ghostly apparitions, kidnappings and family secrets.Sarah believes her family home is haunted, as does her youngest daughter Gracie, and she is determined to discover its secrets. There are gaps in her memories, and she hopes that returning to Blue Peacock Manor, her childhood home, will help her remember them. The house has seen more than its fair share of tragedy over the years, beginning with Sarah's ancestor over 100 years ago, who plunged to her death off the rooftop. It is now in need of repair and renovation, and Sarah hopes that this will give her and her daughters a new start following her divorce.Clint, Sarah's next door neighbour, is an old boyfriend, and there is clearly still a spark between them. Eldest daughter Jade is a typical teenager, hating her new home and struggling to fit in at school. Meanwhile, someone is kidnapping teenage girls and the whole town is on edge.Close to Home flows well. There are a lot of different characters, and I only worked out who the kidnapper was right towards the end. The revealing of the family secrets also came as a surprise. This was a highly enjoyable read.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through Bookbridgr in exchange for an honest review."},

They exchange the confines of Clapham, the weight of the mortgage and anxieties over their future for a blissful break.But Flora didn't anticipate a mysterious guest and a whole heap of family baggage coming too.With James developing a schoolboy crush on a famous singer and Flora distracted by ghosts from her pasts, their dream holiday suddenly takes some very unexpected turns.My verdictAdmittedly, I struggled with Wish You Were Here at first. There are a lot of characters and I felt that the book could have been shortened with extra editing. But once I went back to try again, I did find the book to be more enjoyable second time around.The plot does speed up as it goes along. The descriptions of France are well written and the gentle humour is entertaining. However, I did feel that the teenage characters seemed more mature than the adults at times. Family secrets are revealed towards the end and, as expected, everything ties up nicely, making the book ideal for a summer holiday easy read.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Ugly Young ThingBy Jennifer JaynesPublished by Thomas & Mercer (3 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1477827352Publisher's descriptionSixteen-year-old Allie has already experienced a lifetime of horror, having lost her mother and serial killer brother to mental illness.Returning to her childhood home in Louisiana, Allie ends up in foster care and is placed with Miss Bitty, an eccentric but kindly older women who shoes her a new direction and brighter future.But Allie's new life takes a devastating turn when young women in the area start turning up dead, and she begins to see shadowy figures outside her bedroom. As Miss Bitty grows inexplicably distant, a nagging voice makes Allie wonder if death has found her yet again… or if it never really left her at all.My verdictUgly Young Thing is the sequel to Never Smile at Strangers, which I considered to be an excellent thriller. Although Ugly Young Thing contains references to the first book, it can easily be read as a standalone novel.Allie is a teenager with a tainted past. Her mother was a mentally ill prostitute who killed several people and her brother was a disturbed murderer. After witnessing her brother's suicide, she runs away from the crime scene, hoping to start a new life for herself. In desperation, she eventually returns to her home town and is fostered by Miss Bitty.In her home town, there is a killer on the loose, and young girls are being targeted.  Allie feels that she is being watched. Miss Bitty is determined to keep Allie safe, but the elderly woman has secrets of her own.Ugly Young Thing is full of mystery and intrigue. Jennifer Jaynes's words flow smoothly and are a pleasure to read. She gets emotions spot on - whether it's the way people look, act or behave - and delivers dialogue and action with ease.

First, as an Englishwoman living in the south of France, a stone's throw from Cannes, she suddenly had to contend with language barriers and an unfamiliar health system (albeit an extraordinarilyefficient one).Secondly, as a leading showbusiness writer who has penned for publications including Hello, The Times and You Magazine, her job was jet-setting around the world to meet some of the most famous celebrities of our time.How could she cope with facing them sans wig, battling nausea and exhaustion? How wouldthey react - and was it really possible to go from Cancer to Cannes Film Festival in the space of a few weeks?A memoir with a difference, Breathing Out is full of practical advice, meticulous research and knowledge garnered from Karen's journey, punctuated by hope, positivity and a smattering of bleak humour.My verdictKaren Hockney was fit and healthy, yet at the age of 44 she discovered a lump in her breast that turned out to be cancerous. Breathing Out is the story of her journey, from her initial diagnosis until the end of her treatment. Karen endured almost immediate surgery, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.This informative, emotional and humorous account demonstrates how a cancer diagnosis has an impact on family, friends and work colleagues. One of the hardest issues for Karen to think about was how to break the news to her two teenage daughters. There were many ups and downs in the year after her diagnosis, but Karen's positive attitude helped her (and her family) to get through such a difficult time.Cancer is a difficult subject to write about. In her book, Karen passes on her observations about life with cancer and advice on how to get through the different treatments. She also discusses how she changed her diet and lifestyle following a consultation with a Harley Street nutritionist.Breathing Out isn't a book to 'enjoy', but it's certainly a thought-provoking one.

She's Charlotte Alton. She doesn't trade in secrets, she doesn't erase dark pasts, and she doesn't break hit-men into prison.Except that is exactly what she's been asked to do.The job is impossible: get the assassin into an experimental new prison so that he can take out a target who isn't officially there.It's a suicide mission, and quite probably a set-up.So why can't she say no?My verdictThe Distance is definitely one of my five star reads for 2015.Charlotte Alton inhabits a brutal world of sinister dealings and espionage, where no one is necessarily what they seem. She has instructions to send a hit man, Simon Johanssen, into a self-governing prison where inmates rule the roost. But the target isn't on any prison records, and Charlotte is determined to discover why.In The Distance, there are many different characters, often with shadowy pasts, and it took me a while to remember who they were, occasionally flicking back a few pages to remind myself.  But this didn't detract from the book. The Distance's complex storyline has various layers seamlessly weaved together. This intelligent thriller is fast paced, with twists and turns and some violent scenes.The Distance reminded me of an episode of Spooks, with a roller coaster ride until the end. I found it difficult to put the book down and hope to meet Charlotte Alton and Simon Johanssen again.I received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "My Dear Bessie by Chris Barker and Bessie Moore", "date": "Thursday 2 April 2015", "text": "My Dear BessieBy Chris Barker and Bessie Moore (edited by Simon Garfield)Published by Canongate Books (5 February 2015)ISBN: 978-1782115670Publisher's descriptionTwenty hours have gone since I last wrote. I have been thinking of you. I shall think of you until I post this, and until you get it. Can you feel, as you read these words that I am thinking of you now; aglow, alive, alert at the thought that you are in the same world, and by some strange chance loving me.In September 1943, Chris Barker was serving as a signalman in North Africa when he decided to brighten the long days of war by writing to old friends. One of these was Bessie Moore, a former work colleague. The unexpected warmth of Bessie's reply changed their lives forever. Crossing continents and years, their funny, affectionate and intensely personal letters are a remarkable portrait of a love played out against the backdrop of the Second World War. Above all, their story is a stirring example of the power of letters to transform ordinary lives.My verdictThanks to social media and instant messaging, the art of letter writing appears to have been lost over the decades. As a teenager, I would send letters to friends who lived up the road, just for the sheer pleasure of receiving post. Now my teen and pre-teen simply text, message or Skype when they want to contact their friends - no more waiting in anticipation for a reply or writing long descriptive paragraphs of events or emotions.My Dear Bessie is a love story, an insight into wartime romance. The raw emotion in the letters between Chris and Bessie is divine. The devotion and concern for one another. The feelings they couldn't bear to bottle up or hide away. People struggled to cope with their loved ones being away for long periods of time, missing them both physically and emotionally, yet - as this book shows - love could survive and even blossom through the war. The descriptions of the wartime events, both in London and abroad, are truly fascinating to read. Within their letters, Chris and Bessie discuss moral and political issues, providing historical background. I found it fascinating to read how the British service men passed their time whilst abroad - how they still enjoyed local culture, for example, and sent photos and packages home.The letters are fairly one sided, as unfortunately Chris had to destroy many of Bessie's letters due to lack of storage space. However, he does refer to her letters within his own, which helps to keep the flow going.If you love old-fashioned love stories and wartime romance, My Dear Bessie is a wonderful read.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

The locals have been overwhelmed by a sudden collective madness, causing them to kill themselves and each other in trull gruesome ways. First, Theresa tries to help; then, she is forced to run for her life. An hour later, she emerges to a scene of carnage.There are thirteen other survivors. Slowly, they find one another and face their new reality: trapped in the town by some kind of invisible force-field, cut off from the world outside.What begins as a story of horror becomes a story of survival. Together, they must bury the dead, become a community, face their own fears and weaknesses. Ultimately, they must fight for their lives - because whatever caused the insanity is still at large. And it hasn't finished.Rich with atmosphere, alive to character and emotion. Wake is a riveting tour-de-force. A book about extreme events, ordinary people, heroic compassion - and invisible monsters.My verdictTo begin with, Wake reads like an episode of The Walking Dead, of which I am a great fan. The initial scene is fast-paced horror, and I expected the book to continue like this all the way through.However, after this, the pace changed. This book isn't a horror story, and some readers may be disappointed if this is what they are expecting. It becomes a book of survival, and the story reminded me of Stephen King's Under the Dome.The initial scene is an gruesome event. The town's population goes completely crazy, before killing themselves and each other with zombie-like hunger. The town itself is completely cut off from the outside world by a 'no go' zone, and it seems that there is an invisible monster feeding off the insanity. There are 14 survivors, most of whom begin as strangers. They have to find food, shelter and an organised way to live together, whilst hoping that someone in the outside world will rescue them. But the monster is still out there.Wake is a bizarre but highly visual story - nothing like I have read before. It reminded me of the TV series Lost, which was also intriguing and completely unbelievable. The middle third of the book was a little slow and dragged in places. But as Wake progressed, I couldn't bear to put it down. I wanted an explanation for the events, even though the story became more ludicrous.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

They're looking for any signs of sickness. Any signs of their wards changing. Any sign that it's time to take them to the sanitorium.No one returns from the sanitorium.Withdrawn from his house-mates and living in his memories of the past, Toby spends his days fighting his fear. But then a new arrival in the house shatters the fragile peace, and everything changes.Because everybody dies. It's how you choose to live that counts.My verdictI couldn't wait to read this book, after reading the blurb on the back cover, and I was certainly not disappointed.The Death House is set in the not-too-distant future, when blood tests determine whether or not children and teenagers are afflicted by an incurable disease. The disease has no name, no definitive symptoms. But if the children have markers of the disease in their blood, they are certain to die. The unknowns are when and what the symptoms will be.As soon as a blood test is positive, all afflicted children are taken away from their families to a secluded house, which is nicknamed The Death House. The children there are monitored carefully by cold, emotionless nursing staff and teachers. When a child develops symptoms, they become an outcast and others distance themselves. Then when a child dies, they are taken in the dead of night to the sanatorium and the nursing staff remove all traces of the child's possessions, as if they were never there.The Death House is a sensitive beautifully-written story. Whilst it focuses on relationships between teenagers, it's certainly no teen romance novel. It's a heartbreaking look at how children and teenagers cope when they know they have no future.Most of the young occupants simply exist in the 'here and now', ignoring the past and what the future holds. Toby, however, finds it hard to let go. During the day, he tries to distance himself from the other occupants, whilst holding onto his memories of a normal adolescence. At night, he doesn't take his 'vitamins' from the nurses and, whilst everyone sleeps, he explores the house, in search of its secrets. When new girl Clara arrives, the dynamics within the house change. She shows Toby how to live life to the full while he still can, whatever the future holds.The Death House is an amazing book, with a fascinating underlying story.

SykesPublished by Hodder & Stoughton (Hardback - 25 September 2014, Paperback - 21 May 2015)ISBN: 978-1-444-78577-7Publisher's descriptionOswald de Lacy was never meant to be the Lord of Somerhill Manor.Despatched to a monastery at the age of seven, sent back at seventeen when his father and two older brothers are killed by the Plague, Oswald has no experience of running an estate. He finds the years of pestilence and neglect have changed the old place dramatically, not to mention the attitude of the surviving peasants.Yet some things never change. Oswald's mother remains the powerful matriarch of the family, and his sister Clemence simmers in the background, dangerous and unmarried. Before he can do anything, Oswald is confronted by the shocking death of a young women, Alison Starvecrow. The ambitious village priest claims that Alison was killed by a band of demonic dog-headed men.Oswald is certain this is nonsense, but proving it - by finding the real murderer - is quite a different matter. Every step he takes seem to lead Oswald deeper into the dark maze of political intrigue, family secrets and violent strife.And then the body of another girl is found.My verdictPlague Land kept me hooked from the first page. It's a very well-written historical crime novel, set just after The Black Death.Oswald has been living at a monastery for 10 years since the age of seven. But following the death of his father and older brothers, he unexpectedly becomes Lord of Somerhill Manor. Returning home, he struggles with his new role in life, as local politics and family matters weigh heavy on his young shoulders. Then a murder on his estate leads him to the darker side of Somerhill Manor. With a local priest spreading rumours of witchcraft and supernatural beings, he realises that it's up to him to find the killer before they strike again.Many novels set in this time period use modern-day language or try to use old English, which makes it difficult to follow the story. However, the narration in Plague Land made the characters very believable and true to the 14th century, whilst being very readable. The vivid descriptions enabled me to picture the scenes in my mind and I warmed to the characters easily. The plot flowed smoothly, with plenty of twists and turns to keep me guessing.Plague Land is ideal for fans of CJ Sansom.

But with Claire suffering memory loss and no evidence to be found, nobody believes Jo's story.Twenty-three years later, a familiar face walks into the bookshop where Jo works, dredging up painful memories and rekindling her desire for vengeance. And at the same time, Sergeant Davie Gray is investigating a balaclava-clad man who is attacking women on a disused railway, shocking the sleepy village of Banktoun. But what is the connection between Jo's visitor and the masked man?To catch an assailant, and to give Jo her long-awaited justice, Gray must unravel a tangled web of past secrets, broken friendships and tainted love. But can he crack the case before Jo finds herself with blood on her hands?My verdictBlack Wood is set in a small sleepy village not far from Edinburgh. This is an ideal setting for a psychological thriller with dark secrets at its root. SJI Holliday has captured village life beautifully, with astute observations of the village inhabitants and graphic descriptions of the local surroundings. Everyone wants to know each other's business, especially the town busybody, yet the villagers still have secrets to hide. Strangers get noticed and treated with suspicion, but they are not always the ones to watch.The story centres around what happened to Jo and Claire in Black Wood all those years ago. A vicious attack by two boys left both of their lives in tatters. Jo is a complex character, shaped by both her childhood and the events on that fateful day - she is confused, distrustful and psychologically damaged. Claire was left paralysed, but tries desperately to get on with her life. She is unable to remember what happened in Black Wood and prefers to leave it that way.SJI Holliday has written an atmospheric thriller with intriguing characters. She cleverly weaves past and present together to gradually expose chilling secrets. This is a well-written tale of discovery, revenge and deception. Various twists and turns lead the reader off track, resulting in stunning revelations at the end.

Good looking, great job, completely charming - almost too good to be true …So when Adam suddenly disappear from Grace's life, she is left bewildered and heartbroken. And with a lot of unanswered questions.As she tries desperately to find him, Grace opens a Pandora's Box of secrets and lies - and starts to learn that Adam wasn't so perfect after all.What shameful secrets was her husband hiding? Is Grace in danger? And can she survive the truth? However terrible it may be...My verdictReading the synopsis of His Other Life, I was expecting a psychological thriller. But this book is actually more chick lit (as suggested by the eye-catching cover) than a serious read.When her husband Adam disappears on their first wedding anniversary, Grace realises that she has been viewing him through rose-tinted glasses. Her marriage hasn't been as perfect as she thought and she actually knows nothing about Adam's past. You would expect Grace to be suspicious about Adam's secretive behaviour, but she is incredibly naive and immature. When Adam disappears, she doesn't act like a worried or grieving wife, but tries to continue with life as normal (including visits down the pub). She starts to search for her missing husband with the help of a childhood friend, although the police are also conducting an investigation.Overall, the book is well written and entertaining, although it's a little predictable. The author has made astute observations in her writing, making people and places come alive.His Other Life isn't a novel to take seriously and the synopsis may be a little misleading. If you love dark psychological thrillers, then this probably won't be a book for you. But if you enjoy something light and fluffy with some romance and suspense thrown in, then this would make an ideal summer holiday read.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

One strong Alpha twin and one mutated Omega; the only thing they share is the moment of their death.The Omegas live in segregation, cast out by their families as soon as their mutation becomes clear. Forced to live apart they are ruthlessly oppressed by their Alpha counterparts.The Alphas are the elite.

But Cass has a secret: one that Zach will stop at nothing to expose.The potential to change the world lies in both their hands. One will have to defeat the other to see their vision of the future come to pass, but if they're not careful both will die in the struggle for power.My verdictThe Fire Sermon is a fascinating concept. A world where radiation has caused all births to result in twins - one boy and one girl, one of whom is mutated. People are persecuted for their disability. The mutated twin (the Omega) is cast out by the family as soon as the mutation is identified - this could be a missing limb or psychic abilities, for example. The twins have an invisible bond; when one dies, the other dies too. This is why the Omegas can't be killed and, when their twin is an important Alpha, they can become a target.This dystopian young adult novel started off a bit too slowly for me. It was well written and there were some good twists, but I felt that it needed more action early on. The characters weren't as well developed as they could have been. The relationship between Cass and Zach wasn't explored deeply enough and I didn't find that the romance element of the story was believable.Overall, however, The Fire Sermon was an enjoyable read and I can see it appealing to the young adult market. The ending left many unanswered questions and felt a bit abrupt, which leads me to assume that there is a sequel on its way.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Even after thirty years they have lots to say to each other, many interests in common and, until recently, a good sex life.But Lawrence seems wary and restless. Something's wrong. Just how wrong, Jo is about to discover…Can they use their years of history - all the things they've shared - to overcome a devastating betrayal?My verdictA Most Desirable Marriage is a slow burning story about a husband who has an affair. Not only is this totally out of character for him, but the person with whom he has the affair is a complete shock for his wife and children. The couple are in their 60s, having been married for over 30 years, making it even more unexpected.The story was a bit too slow for me and cliched. I found it difficult to feel anything for the characters. In particular, I found Jo and Lawrence's children to be very needy. I would also have liked Jo to have had more backbone, as I found the ending to be unsatisfying.

{"title": "Hausfrau by Jill Alexander Essbaum", "date": "Sunday 15 March 2015", "text": "HausfrauBy Jill Alexander EssbaumPublished by Random House (26 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1447280798Publisher's descriptionAnna Benz, an American in her late thirties, lives with her Swiss husband Bruno and their three young children in a postcard-perfect suburb of Zurich. Though she leads a comfortable well-appointed life, Anna is falling apart inside. Adrift and increasingly unable to connect with the emotionally unavailable Bruno, even with her own thoughts and feelings, Anna tries to rouse herself with new experiences: German language classes, Jungian analysis, and a series of sexual affairs she enters into with an ease that surprises even her. Tensions escalate, and her lies start to spin out of the control. Having crosses a moral threshold, Anna will discover where a woman goes when there's no doing back.My verdictNot many books leave my head spinning, overloaded with thoughts and emotions. Hausfrau is certainly one of those books. It is the story of an intelligent married American woman who feels bored, alone and unhappy in Zurich. Her Swiss husband works long hours and gives her little attention. Although she clearly loves her children, she is just as happy to spend her days roaming around the shops, and embarks on several affairs to help pass the time.I felt like I should despise Anna, who made little effort to learn the language and make friends, yet all I could feel for her was pity. All her materialistic needs were being met, but she was clearly craving physical closeness and attention, turning to men for comfort. There was no love or affection involved in these affairs, just sex and desire.The book grabbed my attention from the first line: 'Anna was a good wife, mostly.' The words had a poetic rhythm that sang as I read. The language was timeless and indulgent. The clever use of German grammar moves the story along. I wanted to keep reading, yet at the same time I didn't want the book to end.Hausfrau is about people not places - there are no vivid descriptions of Switzerland, for example. It's Anna's emotions and feelings that take prominence, as she spirals out of control both morally and psychologically. This is certainly not light reading or a book with any humour. But it is a fascinating, highly addictive, story.Thanks to the publisher for an Advance Reader Copy in exchange for an honest review."},

In a sealed chamber deep in the heart of Gilmerton Cove, the victim has undergone a macabre ritual of purification.Inspector Tony McLean knew the dead man, and can't shake the suspicion that there is more to this case than meets the eye. The lack of forensics at the crime scene is not the only thing that McLean will find beyond belief.Teamed with the most unlikely and unwelcome of allies, McLean must track down a killer with the darkest compulsions, who answers only to a higher power...My verdictThis is my first James Oswald book, but is the fifth in the Inspector McClean series. Despite some references to previous books, this didn't affect my enjoyment of Prayer for the Dead.Prayer for the Dead is a police procedural with some supernatural aspects. This was a welcome change from some of the other (equally as enjoyable) crime books I have read recently. There was plenty of forensic information and descriptions of the police investigations, as well as some interesting characters.The book begins when McClean is asked to investigate the disappearance of a journalist, whose body is then found in an obscure location - dark caves underneath the Edinburgh and only accessible through underground passages. When another body is found, again with little forensic evidence to provide any clues, it's clear that there is a twisted killer on the loose.I didn't learn much about McLean in this book and would have liked to know more - this may have been covered in previous books, but I noticed that some other reviews suggest he is a fairly mysterious character.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "You Belong to Me (Samantha Hayes) - BLOG TOUR", "date": "Wednesday 11 March 2015", "text": "I am delighted to be today's stop on the BLOG TOUR for Samantha Hayes' You Belong to Me, which is being published tomorrow (12 March 2015) by Century.I would like to welcome Samantha Hayes, who has some excellent advice for aspiring authors.My Top 10 Writing Tips by Samantha HayesI know what it feels like to have a story or novel burning away inside you, yet somehow it just won’t come out onto the page the way you want, let alone turn into a full-length novel. So I thought I’d compose a list of tips to help aspiring writers along their journey. I’ve done all of these things myself, so it’s proof they work! Some may be obvious, but they’re still really, really important – and they’re in no particular order. Happy writing!1) You're going to need support on the long journey to publication, so it's a great idea to join a writing group or club. You'll meet like-minded people who understand your frustrations, and who will also congratulate you on your successes. This may be online or 'in real life', but either way, it will help keep the focus.2) Read the type of books you want to write. These should be books that inspire you, excite you, throw fuel on your literary fire. Don't copy or emulate, but innovate. And all the while read, read, read in your chosen genre.3) Following on from above, don't write what you know, rather write what you love. There's a difference. If you're excited by your writing, it will shine through and your readers will stick with you to the end.4) Write every day. If you want to be a published author, you need to start treating it like a profession. It's hard work, and you need to put pen to paper, or fingers to keyboard, every day. Set a word target or a time limit, and stick to it. Even if you only write a paragraph or two, it's better than nothing. I firmly believe writing is like a muscle. The more you do it, the stronger and better it gets.5) Give as good as you get… in terms of feedback, that is. Offer your opinion and constructive criticism to members of your writing group. It will help you immensely in identifying what may be wrong with your work. Critiquing a piece of writing will shine a light on your own.6) Get to know the business. Go to writing festivals, literary events, author talks, 'meet the agent' pitches, public book launches… Whatever you can find, go and mingle with people who also love books. Don't shove your 600-page manuscript under every editor or agent's nose, but use the experience to learn about how the business works.  Be professional now, and those in the business will remember you when your work arrives on their desk. A quick 'google' will bring up many events to attend.7) Another obvious one - but make sure you have a cracking story to tell! You need a hook, something to grab the reader's attention from page one, and keep them turning the pages. Try to sum up your idea in a sentence or two. For example, You Belong to Me is about a woman who fled her stalker, but is forced to return home when her parents are killed. She thinks she's safe, but her nightmare is about to begin again.8) Never give up! I knew I wanted to be an author aged around 11 or 12. My first thriller was published when I was 40. During that time, I was always writing, practicing, getting better, developing and doing all the other points in this list. Stick at it!9) Edit your work. Know the value of this process, because in many ways, it's almost more important than the writing itself. Once your work is finished, I'd advise not looking at it for a month. When you come back to it with fresh eyes, make notes to yourself where the story doesn't work. And fix it! If that means cutting a character, or your favourite scene, or even adding in another point of view to make it work, then do it. Take your time. This is the most important stage and will pay dividends.10) Finally, enjoy your writing! If you don't, no one else will. You are creating a piece of entertainment - what could be better? So find yourself a quiet space, make a cuppa, turn off your phone, and write your novel. I absolutely loved writing You Belong to Me (though I scared myself a few times!) and I really hope you love reading it.You Belong to Me by Samantha Hayes,published by Century, at £12.99My verdict: This brilliant psychological thriller is an amazing read. This is Samantha Hayes at her best.Read my full review: http://off-the-shelfbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/you-belong-to-me.htmlFind out moreFollow Samantha Hayes on Twitter…https://twitter.com/samhayesFollow the BLOG TOUR!

{"title": "Fragile Lies by Laura Elliot", "date": "Tuesday 10 March 2015", "text": "Fragile LiesBy Laura ElliotPublished by Bookouture (13 February 2015)ISBN: 978-1909490796Publisher's descriptionHis name is Michael Carmody. He is a writer and a father. His son is lying in a coma, fighting for his life.Her name is Lorraine Cheevers. She is an artist and mother. An illicit affair has destroyed her marriage.Michael is desperate to find the couple who left his son for dead, a victim of a hit and run.Lorraine is desperate to start a new life for her and her daughter.Michael and Lorraine are about to cross paths - damaged souls, drawn to one another.They don't know that their lives are already connected.They don't know the web of lies surrounding them.They are each searching for the truth. But when they find it, it could destroy them both.My verdictFragile Lies is a complex story of relationships, betrayal and deception with tragic consequences.The book begins with an illicit liaison that ends in a hit and run accident. We are then introduced to Lorraine, who is setting up a new life with her daughter, following the breakdown of her marriage. And also to Michael, who is the father of the hit and run victim and is determined to discover who did this to his child.Fragile Lies didn't grab my attention straight away. I found the flashbacks and switching between characters to be disjointed, and I was confused in places. The chapters from the viewpoint of Killian, the hit-and-run victim, were too short and didn't really add anything to the story early on. Later, they became more significant and more relevant to the story.Laura Elliot has created two totally unlikeable characters in Virginia and Adrian, which I assume was her intention. Virginia is a nasty piece of work - prepared to step on anyone, including her husband and best friend. Adrian is weak and totally besotted with Virginia, to the detriment of his marriage and relationship with his daughter. Lorraine and Michael's characters seemed a little flat and I found it hard to sympathise with either of them until the second half of the book.I am pleased that I persisted, however, as the pace picked up at around 43%. From this moment, the plot flowed more smoothly and it became obvious where the story was heading. I assume that the author intended for the readers to figure everything out at around this stage.Overall, I give Fragile Lies a 3.5 star rating. With more careful editing, I would give it 4 stars, but it doesn't quite reach that for me.I received an Advanced Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "Another Person's Poison by Matthew Smith", "date": "Monday 9 March 2015", "text": "Another Person's Poison: A History of Food AllergyBy Matthew SmithPublished by Columbia University Press (2 June 2015)ISBN: 978-0231164849Publisher's descriptionTo some, food allergies seem like fabricated cries for attention. For others, they pose a dangerous health threat. Food allergies are bound up with so many personal and ideological concerns that it is difficult to determine what is medical and what is myth. This book parses the political, economic, cultural, and genuine health factors of a phenomenon that now dominates our interactions with others and our understanding of ourselves. Surveying the history of food allergy from ancient times to the present, Another Person's Poison also gives readers a clear grasp of new medical findings on allergies and what they say about our environment, our immune system, and the nature of the food we consume.For most of the twentieth century, food allergies were considered a fad or junk science. While many physicians and clinicians argue that certain foods could cause a range of chronic problems, from asthma and eczema to migraines and hyperactivity, others believed that allergies were psychosomatic. Another Person's Poison traces the trajectory of this debate and its effect on public-health policy and the production, manufacture, and consumption of food. Are rising allergy rates purely the result of effective lobbying and a booming industry built on self-diagnosis and expensive remedies? Or should physicians become more flexible in their approach to food allergies and more careful in their diagnoses? Exploring the issue from scientific, political, economic, social and patient-centered perspectives, this book is the first to engage fully with the history of what is now a major modern affliction, illuminating society's troubled relationship with food, disease and the creation of medical knowledge.My verdictI wanted to review this book from three perspectives: firstly, as a health journalist who writes articles for pharmacists and consumers about allergies; secondly, as the author of a consumer book on children's allergies; thirdly, as the mother of a child with nut allergy.Another Person's Poison is essentially a historical textbook, examining the history of food allergies using medical writing, literature, case studies, research studies and anecdotal evidence. It covers attitudes towards food allergies and their place in society, as well as controversies surrounding the research into a range of allergy topics (e.g. the links between food allergies and migraine, asthma, eczema and behaviour).The book is well researched and well written. But it was not necessarily what I was expecting. From the description, I expected more coverage of why allergies are on the increase in modern society.I found chapter six the most interesting. This chapter looked mainly at the consumption of peanuts in society and the resulting rise in peanut allergy and anaphylactic reactions, using case studies, research references and media reports. There was also a mention of whether peanut allergy should be considered  to be a public health concern and the development of nut-free zones in schools. However, theories about the rise in peanut allergy cases over the last few decades were only touched upon very briefly.In his conclusion, Matthew Smith writes that his book 'does not attempt to resolve the debates about food allergy or, even more foolishly, explain why allergies to foods such as peanuts are on the increase.' As a historian, he says that this is not what he is trained to do. However, I did feel that this is a bit of a cop out, as the hypotheses over why allergies are on the rise are a significantly important part of food allergy history.If you are looking for an in-depth look at doctors' diagnoses and viewpoints of food allergies through the centuries, then this is the book for you. But if you are looking for a book that explores why food allergies have become more common, you will need to look elsewhere.I received an Advanced Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest reviewWhat Burns AwayBy Melissa Falcon FieldPublished by Sourcebooks Landmark (6 January 2015)ISBN: 978-1492604563Publisher's descriptionGood wife, good mother. That's all Claire Spruce is trying to be, but the never-ending snow in this new town and her workaholic husband are making her crazy. Even the sweet face of her toddler son can't pull her out of the dark places in her head.Feeling overwhelmed and alone, she reconnects with her long-lost high school boyfriend, Dean, who offers an intoxicating, reckless escape. But Dean's reappearance is not a coincidence. He wants something from Claire - and she soon finds that the cost of repaying an old favour may lead to the destruction of her entire life.What Burns Away is a story of loyalty, family, and the consequences of the past's inevitable collision with our future.My verdictMy first reaction to What Burns Away, before I read anything other than the title, was that I loved the bright eye-catching cover. It certainly caught my attention.What Burns Away is the compelling story of Claire's emotional and tragic teenage years and how they have shaped her adulthood - her mother's infidelity and abandonment of the family home, her father's despair and struggle to cope and her growing relationship with an older boy, Dean.Now married with a young son and workaholic husband, Claire is lonely and in desperate need of attention. Claire's husband clearly loves her, but is so obsessed with his work that she feels neglected while he spends long hours at the office. Having given up her own work before the pregnancy and now moving to a new town, she feels that she is slowly losing her identity. In an attempt to discover herself, she thinks back to the excitement of her youth and searches on Facebook for old friends and memories. She re-discovers Dean, her high school boyfriend. He has clearly never stopped loving her and has bought the house to which her mother fled all those years ago as it reminds him of Claire. But he is struggling financially and now wants Claire's help. On meeting Dean again after all these years, Claire starts believing that escaping her own marriage could be her salvation.I loved the darkness underlying Claire's story, as she weaves together events from her adolescence and adulthood. Melissa Falcon Field has a wonderful way with words, as she describes Claire's emotions bubbling to the surface and events of the past.After reading the last page of What Burns Away, I felt emotionally exhausted. The book left me thinking about ambitions and achievements in life. Should we be satisfied with what we have or always search for something more? Is it realistic to expect our childhood and adolescent ambitions to continue as we reach adulthood, even as our circumstances change?I received an Advanced Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Perfect for fans of S J Watson and Sophie Hannah.Fleeing the terrors of her former life, Isabel has left England, and at last is beginning to feel safe.Then a letter shatters her world, and she returns home determined not to let fear rule her life any more.But she's unable to shake off the feeling that someone who knows her better than she knows herself may be following her.Watching. Waiting.Ready to step back into her life and take control all over again.My verdictThis brilliant psychological thriller is an amazing read. This is Samantha Hayes at her best.You Belong to Me kept me guessing right to the end. Just as I thought I had it sussed, there was yet another twist or turn.The dramatic prologue, with an assault on a young woman, Alex, leads us to Isabel, who is hiding out in India. She is paranoid, suspicious and scared, disturbed by a previous relationship. Then distressing news leads her to reluctantly head back home to England.Although Isabel is on edge, she starts to feel more relaxed once she sees for herself that the source of all her paranoia is lying in a coma. But then when she realises someone has been into her flat, it's clear that something sinister is going on.Samantha Hayes has developed the plotline brilliantly, with tension and intrigue, and has also created some believable characters. I was suspicious of Owen from the start - right place, right time and overly friendly, letting Isabel move into his basement and giving her a job. I was surprised she was so trusting after her past experience. But my views on him changed after a particular incident (no spoilers) and then changed again further into the book.The book also follows DI Lorraine Fisher. Lorraine is trying to investigate the deaths of Alexandra and Melanie, but isn't being taken seriously when she voices her opinion that the murders are linked. Stress, resulting in ill-health, leads her to take some time off work and investigate on her own. You know her life will collide with Isabel's at some point, but it's a question of when and how.Around three-quarters of the way through, You Belong to Me gets even creepier, and Isabel starts questioning her own sanity. Is someone playing with her mind, or is her mind playing with her? My heart was thumping for the last half of the book and I couldn't put bear to put it down. Great ending - I certainly didn't see that coming and all I could think was 'wow'. I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Join me on Samantha Hayes' Blog Tour on 11th March."},

The beautiful house becomes her sanctuary, a place to hide her shame from society in the care of the housekeeper, Mrs Jelphs. But the manor also becomes a place of suspicion, one of secrecy.Something isn't right.Someone is watching.There are secrets that the manor house seems determined to keep. Tragedy haunts the empty rooms and foreboding hangs heavy in the stifling heat. Traces of the previous occupant, Elizabeth Stanton, are everywhere and soon Alice discovers Elizabeth's life eerily mirrors the path she herself is on.The past is set to repeat its sorrows, with devastating consequences.My verdictThe Girl in the Photograph is the tale of two women, both pregnant, in different time periods. Both women feel very isolated with no friends around to support them. Alice, who is pregnant out of wedlock, has been sent to the country by her mother. Elizabeth is desperate for a second child, but has experienced pregnancy and post-natal complications in the past.Unusually for a time lapse book, this is based in the 1930s and 1898, rather than having one of the women living in the present day. This definitely makes the story particularly fascinating and a bonus, as it is like reading two historical fiction novels in one! Even though Alice and Elizabeth are living over 30 years apart, they share many similarities - they both feel stifled by others and unable to decide their own future.The Girl in the Photograph was a lovely easy read, with beautiful descriptions of the Gloucestershire countryside that stimulate all the senses. Not only could I see the surroundings in my mind, but I could hear them and smell them too.I enjoyed the mystery surrounding Fiercombe Manor and Stanton House, and what happened to Elizabeth and her family, and it kept me guessing until the end. I couldn't put the book down for the final 20 percent, as everything tied together with a few surprise revelations.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review"},

But Rose has dementia - so what does she actually know, and who would believe her anyway?As Catherine starts investigating Rose's allegations, terrible revelations surface about everyone involved. Can Catherine find out what's really going on before it's too late?My verdictI loved this book and read it in a couple of hours in just one sitting.The Exit is an unusual story and very well written. It begins as a fairly straightforward easy read, but then develops into a brilliant sick and twisted plot, as the layers build up and more characters are introduced.I took an instant dislike to Catherine, who is incredibly immature at the beginning and, as described by Rose, is rather dull. However, my views gradually changed throughout the course of the book; her personality grows with the story as circumstances force her to take on more responsibility in her life.Rose was a brilliant character - a spunky 82 year old with plenty of attitude who doesn't stand for any nonsense. She drifts between moments of total lucidity and moments of regression back to her 10-year-old self. Sadly, due to her dementia, no one believes most of what she has to say - yet she actually holds the key to what is going on in Dear Green nursing home.The Exit is very creepy, with humour and horror thrown into the mix. Helen FitzGerald is a very talented author.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

HardistyPublished by Orenda Books (Kindle Edition - 15 December 2014; Paperback - 8 March 2015)ISBN: 978-1910663052Publisher's descriptionClaymore Straker is trying to forget a violent past. Working as an oil company engineer in the wilds of Yemen, he is hijacked at gunpoint by Islamic terrorists. Clay has a choice: help uncover the cause of a mysterious sickness afflicting the village of Al Urush, close to the company's oil-processing facility, or watch Abdulkader, his driver and close friend, die.As the country descends into civil war and village children start dying, Clay finds himself caught up in a ruthless struggle between opposing armies, controllers of the country's oil wealth, Yemen's shadowy secret service, and rival terrorist factions.As Clay scrambles to keep his friend alive, he meets Rania, a troubled journalist. Together, they try to uncover the truth about Al Urush. But nothing in this ancient, unforgiving place is what it seems. Accused of a murder he did not commit, put on the CIA's most-wanted list, Clay must come to terms with his past and confront the powerful forces that want him dead.Gritty, gripping and shocking, The Abrupt Physics of Dying will not only open your eyes, but keep them glued to the page until the final, stunning denouement is reached.My verdictThe Abrupt Physics of Dying is an eco-thriller with immense detail and a fascinating background story.  The well-written almost-poetic vivid descriptions are unusual in a book of this genre, showing how the author Paul E. Hardisty has a gift for detailed but fast-paced writing.The book was a pleasure to read. There's a bit of everything in here - conspiracy theories, history, politics, a love interest and, of course, a strong action hero. You can tell the author cares deeply for his subject, with the historical and political detail weaved within the thrilling plot.When you read the author's bio, you realise that the subject matter is one of his many passions. Paul E. Hardisty has worked as an engineer, hydrologist and environmental scientist and survived a bomb blast in a cafe in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, in 1993. He's also an action man himself - sailor, private pilot, keen outdoorsman and conservation volunteer.This is an excellent debut novel for both the author and the publisher and I am looking forward to reading the sequel, The Evolution of Fear, which is being published next year.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},

Tell a little tale about it.When I reach H for Heart, what will I say?How we loved to string crocheted hearts in trees? How our hearts steadily unravelled?So I begin with A. Adam's apple.Will you be there to catch me when I fall?My verdictBooks about terminal illness are a current trend. But unlike most of these, The A - Z of You and Me isn't overly sentimental. There are no sob stories and no final messages to loved ones. It's not bogged down with details of death and illness, but is an uplifting yet sad story of misspent youth, bad life choices and the repercussions of self-destruction.James Hannah has produced an original honest look at a life with plenty of regrets. This emotional journey made me laugh and cry, with wry humour on one page and sad revelations on the next.To begin with, all you know is that Ivo is dying in a hospice, refusing any visitors. His nurse Sheila suggests a game to pass the time - go through the alphabet from A to Z, find a part of your body for each letter and think of a story or memory relating to it.The A - Z of You and Me carries a whole host of emotions - love, guilt, blame, hopelessness, loneliness, shame and grief. I expected the book to be disjointed - literally just an A to Z list  - but it is so creative and well written that it flows seamlessly from beginning to end, each entry linking to the next. As the story unravels, Ivo's journey to the hospice is revealed, alongside snapshots from his past.The A - Z of You and Me covers a difficult topic, but I found it to be an easy read with a perfect pace throughout.

She has grown up with no friends and little contact with the outside world; her only form of entertainment is visiting The British Museum daily, watching the exhibits gradually disappear and helping the homeless people who have set up camp there.Throughout her childhood, Lalla has listened to her parents speak about a large ship, which her father is building to take them to a better place. Then as civilised society comes to an end, it is time for Lalla and her family to make that journey.Her father claims that he has built the ship for her, to save her from the chaos, and has hand-picked each one of its 500 occupants. But as time goes on, Lalla begins to realise that the ship is becoming less of a home and more of prison.The Ship follows a voyage - not only of the ship, but also Lalla's own voyage of self-discovery. The thought-provoking book flows from beginning to end, full of questions and moral issues.This amazing debut is creepy and unique and I didn't want it to end. In fact the ending left me wanting more, and I am now desperate to discover the next stage in Lalla's journey.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

After too many years spent in the company of evil, she's quit the Feds and is working out what normal is meant to feel like. She's swapped serious killers, stakeouts and interrogation for a husband, friends and free time. But when you've walked in the darkness for so long, can you stand the light?When a local teenager dies in a tragic drowning accident, the community thinks Brigid might be able to help comfort the family. But when she does so, something doesn't add up. And it's no easier at home: after a bereavement in the family, Brigid has reluctantly taken in her niece to give her a break before  she starts college. Brigid's ever-patient husband Carlo tells her they must go easy on Gemma-Kate, the grieving youngster. Which is fine, until she starts taking an unhealthy interest in dissecting the local wildlife.For Brigid, death still seems to be wherever she turns. But as she herself starts to feel unwell, it's her own mortality that is the most troubling. And as she tries to get to the bottom of a serious of allegedly accidental deaths and increasingly gruesome occurrences at home, she slowly realises that maybe this time, she's let the darkness inside the only place she ever felt safe. Sometimes, death is closer than you think.My verdictFear The Darkness is set in Tucson, Arizona, which is one of my favourite US states. Ex-FBI profiler Brigid Quinn is asked to investigate the death of a teenage boy - the mother doesn't believe it is accidental or suicide. Meanwhile, Brigid's home life is disrupted when she takes in her niece, following the death of her sister in law. When Brigid starts to feel worse for wear, she wonders whether her niece is poisoning her or if it is related to the case.Fear The Darkness is character led rather than crime led. Brigid Quinn is a very strong character and it makes a change to have an older sixty-ish female protagonist. She is physically fit and mentally sharp, with a dry sense of humour. This enjoyable thriller concentrates on Brigid's family, giving her a strong background and making the book quite personal.After a slightly slow start, the pace picked up and then I couldn't put the book down. There's a great unexpected twist at the end. I haven't read the first Brigid Quinn book - Rage Against the Dying - but I will be doing so very shortly.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Because Polly is in love: she's in love with the beautiful seaside town she calls home, she's in love with running the bakery on Beach Street, and she's in love with her boyfriend Huckle.And yet there's something unsettling about the gentle summer breeze that's floating through town. Selina, recently widowed, hopes that moving to Mount Polbearne will ease her grief, but Polly has a secret that could destroy her friend's fragile recovery. Responsibilities that Huckle thought he'd left behind are back and Polly finds it hard to cope with his increasingly long periods of absence.Polly sifts flour, kneads dough and bakes bread, but nothing can calm the storm she knows is coming: is Polly about to lose everything she loves?My verdictI have always enjoyed Jenny Colgan's books for some light feel-good relief and this was no exception. I read her previous Little Beach Street Bakery book last summer.This book yet again brings Cornwall to life, with fun endearing characters and lots of mishaps. It's chick lit at its best and not the formulaic girl meets boy storyline. This has a hint of tragedy alongside the warmth and entertainment, including a tame penguin and a rundown lighthouse.I read the book in just a few hours. It's ideal for a night in, curled up on the settee with a hot cup of tea and a big bar of chocolate. You don't necessarily need to read the first Little Beach Street Bakery book before this one, but I think it helps to give you the background and meet the characters.I hope Jenny Colgan has a third Little Beach Street Bakery book in the pipeline.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

One act of revenge.When Emma Joseph met her husband David, he was a man shattered by grief. His first wife had been killed outright when her car veered off the road. Just as tragically, their six-year-old daughter mysteriously vanished from the scene of the accident.Now, six years later, Emma believes the painful years are behind them. She and David have built a new life together and have a beautiful baby son, Ollie.Then a stranger walks in their lives, and their world tilts on its axis.Emma's life no longer feels secure. Does she know what really happened all those years ago? And why does she feel so frightened for herself and for her baby?When a desperate Emma reaches out to her old friend DCI Tom Douglas for help, she puts all their lives in jeopardy. Before long, a web of deceit is revealed that shocks both Emma and Tom to the core.They say you should never trust a stranger. Maybe they're right.My verdictStranger Child is a gripping read, involving a tangled web of deception. I was intrigued from the first chapter, which described the car accident and disappearance of Natasha Joseph.There are many twists and turns and questions that need to be answered throughout the book. Different subplots gradually come together as the story unfolds, and it is hard to know which of the main characters can be trusted.Stranger Child is a written well, hard-to-put-down psychological thriller.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.SummertimeBy Vanessa LafayePublished by Orion Publishing Group (1 February 2015)ISBN: 978-1409155379 Publisher's descriptionHorrifying and beautiful, Summertime is a fictionalised account of one of the most devastating natural disasters in US history.Tens of thousands of black and white men scarred by their experiences of war in Europe return home to find themselves abandoned to destitution by the US government.The tiny, segregated community of Heron Key is suddenly overwhelmed by broken, disturbed men with new ideas about racial equality and nothing left to lose.Tensions flare when a black veteran is accused of committing the most heinous crime of all against a white resident's wife.And not far off the strongest and more intense hurricane American has ever witnessed is gaining force.My verdictSummertime is a beautifully written novel of racial segregation, the tragedy of war, broken war veterans and the beating of a white married woman in Florida in the 1930s.It has well-developed memorable characters, vivid descriptions of life in the Florida Keys and ample historical background. You can feel the racial tension, with scenes of violence and oppression, and the despair and frustration of the veterans living in poverty.The book begins with the community preparing for the annual Fourth of July beach barbecue, which all goes horribly wrong when the angry veterans arrive and a local white woman is found beaten and left for dead.  The pace of the writing changes as the ferocious hurricane arrives, capturing the terror of those caught in the middle of the damage and devastation. The whole community is struck by tragedy - and the sad and moving ending reveals how the survivors' lives will never be the same again.I could picture the scenes as they panned out - always a sign of a well-written book for me.  It's an excellent debut novel.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Her free time is spent with a charity for teenage girls in London, helping them mend their broken lives - which is ironic, since her own life is fractured beyond repair.Reserved upper-class journalist Paul Farrell is everything Kate and her teenage charges aren't. But when Paul agrees to help Kate with her charity by accompanying her on a trip to the Yorkshire Moors, he makes a stunning revelation that changes everything, and leaves Kate torn.Can she risk her son's happiness as well as her own?My verdictA Way From Heart to Heart is a lovely easy read. It is a sad but uplifting story of two people mourning the loss of a husband/friend. The emotional scene when Paul breaks the news to Kate of her husband's death (at the beginning of the book) is beautifully and sensitively written.This romantic love story proved to me that a novel doesn't need sex scenes to make it work. The characters are extremely likeable and believable with interesting backgrounds to shape their personalities. It is clear that Paul cares for Kate, but she has to learn to trust him and let love into her life again, whilst protecting her young son's happiness.Helena Fairfax has written a lovely contemporary romance, keeping the reader guessing until the end about whether it will be 'happily ever after'.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Burnt Paper SkyBy Gilly MacmillanPublished by Little Brown Book Group UK (Kindle edition - 5 February 2015; Paperback - 27th August 2015)ISBN: 978-0349406398Publisher's descriptionRachel Jenner turned her back for a moment. Now her eight-year-old son Ben is missing.But what really happened that fateful afternoon?Caught between her personal tragedy and a public who have turned against her, there is nobody left who Rachel can trust. But can the nation trust Rachel?The clock is ticking to find Ben alive.My verdictI read Burnt Paper Sky in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. This very cleverly written psychological thriller follows the search for a missing boy through the eyes of his mother Rachel Jenner and also Jim Clemo, the police officer running the case. It taps into parents' biggest fears and worries - and the guilt they would feel if their child disappeared after leaving their sight for just a few moments. It's a story about finding the balance between protecting your child and giving them enough independence to grow and develop as an individual.Filled with twists and turns, this brilliant debut flows from beginning to end. You can feel Rachel's anguish and Jim Clemo's frustration. At first there are few leads, but then more information comes to light as Jim Clemo searches the family background. The use of social media reports, television and newspapers adds to the tension and makes the story feel very real, as the nation responds to the case.Burnt Paper Sky gets five stars from me, and I will be watching out for more books from Gilly Macmillan.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review, and then also won a printed version through Goodreads."},

But a murder committed so many years ago still has the power to reverberate decades later with deadly consequences.It's a double surprise for Trooper Leigh Abbott as she investigates a cold case and discovers two murder victims in a historic nineteenth-century building. Together with forensic anthropologist Matt Lowell and medical examiner Dr. Edward Rowe, she uncovers the secrets of a long-forgotten, Prohibition-era speakeasy in the same building. But when the two victims are discovered to be relatives - their deaths separated by over eighty years - the case deepens, and suddenly the speakeasy is revealed as ground zero for a cascade of crimes through the decades.When a murder committed nearly forty years ago comes under fresh scrutiny, the team realises than an innocent man was wrongly imprisoned and the real murderer is still at large. Now they must solve three murders spanning over eighty years if they hope to set a wronged man free.My verdictYet another great book in the Abbott and Lowell Forensic Mysteries series - this is the fourth book in the series.A wonderful mixture of historical information, a well-written plotline, forensics and romance. I like the way each chapter starts with a historical fact and how the authors describe the forensics in layperson's terms.I look forward to the next book.Thanks to Jen J Danna for sending me a copy of the book all the way from Canada.Tell Tale By Mark SennenPublished by Avon, Harper Collins UK (12th February 2015)ISBN: 978-0007587872Publisher's descriptionDI CHARLOTTE SAVAGE KNOWS WHO KILLED HER DAUGHTERBut before Charlotte can get her revenge, disturbing events start to unfold on Dartmoor…A woman's naked body is found near an isolated reservoir on the bleak winter moors. When the woman's housemate also goes missing, Charlotte knows she must move fast.But in a police force tainted by corruption, Charlotte's hunt for the killer won't be easy.And resisting her own urge to kill will be even harder…A page-turning, terrifying crime thriller, perfect for fans of Peter May and Tim Weaver, and TV series Broadchurch and Scott and Bailey.My verdictI hadn't read a DI Savage book before, so I was very interested to discover if I could read this fourth book in the series without reading the first three. Thanks to a well written plot, with enough background information about DI Savage's past, I was able to do so. There were slight spoilers about the previous books, but not enough to turn me off reading these as well at some point.Tell Tale starts off as the search for a murderer, following the discovery of the body of a naked young woman on the moors. However, the book is about far more than this, with several subplots that come together at the end in one giant web of deception.One subplot concerns the identity of the hit and run driver who killed DI Savage's young daughter five years earlier. And how DI Savage is torn between doing the right thing as an officer of the law and the bitter choice of a mother tormented with grief.Another involves police corruption and a cover up to protect those involved in a criminal act.And then there is another subplot about the bloody slaughter of horses in satanic rituals.Tell Tale is an intriguing story, with a strong independent female lead character. The story moves along at a decent pace, with enough action and new events to keep the book flowing constantly. There are plenty of twists and turns as the story unfolds, right until the end. I look forward to reading more DI Savage books.I received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Lindy lives there with her family, Rachel is living permanently in her holiday home following her divorce and Beth is staying in an empty holiday let (her sister's future parents-in-law's cottage).The three women all have their issues to address. Rachel suffers from OCD and likes to be in control. Newly graduated Beth has a rebellious nature, running away from decisions in her life, and needs to find some direction. Lindy is devoted to her two young children, yet at the age of just 23 her life is already stuck in a rut.The women quickly become friends and decide to start a vintage wedding business. This is partly to help Beth organise a wedding for her sister but also to give their lives some focus.A Vintage Wedding was entertaining and enjoyable. However, it was maybe unrealistic for three complete strangers to set up a business together so soon after meeting. It was also very convenient that they were able to do certain tasks without any proper training, such as icing a cake and wedding make up (all with the help of YouTube videos). These skills take most people years to learn and perfect.The book was maybe a bit too convenient and idealistic for me. However, it makes an enjoyable holiday read - easy and well written with some romance thrown in.I received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Arlidge's series. I know that this third book has been enjoyed by many other readers and reviewers, so I was surprised to feel disappointed at the end.The underlying storyline - the kidnapped woman and the bodies discovered on the remote beach - had the makings of a great plot. However, having read some similar books recently, I found The Doll's House to be a bit too formulaic. There was no 'wow' moment or any particular twists and turns.The book covers a lot of background with office politics and the personal struggles of three female characters. This was interesting to read, but I felt that this detracted away from the murders and slowed down the pace too much for me.I received an Advance Reader Copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

And now a lot of people depend on Charlie: by his last count, sixty-eight employees at his Atlanta auto dealership, eleven shiftless brothers and sisters, an ungrateful wife, a spoiled daughter, a shameless girlfriend. Who could really blame him for wanting a little extra?The arrangement is simple: Charlie picks up a suit from the dry cleaner’s. In the suit pocket is the name of a very important man. The next day, that man walks into the dealership, drives out in a new car, and Charlie gets a fat envelope full of cash. Everyone’s happy. No one gets hurt. So long as Charlie doesn’t cross his business partner. But with one twist of a knife, the unthinkable happens. And suddenly Charlie is in deeper trouble than he could have possibly imagined.Necessary WomenIn a border town between Georgia and Alabama, in a three-room house made of cement block, a fourteen-year-old girl watches her mother die. Her father is a long-haul trucker, away for weeks, sometimes months, at a time. Her mother, with two menial jobs cleaning restrooms and working nights at the laundry, had been just thirty years old.A week before she died, noticing her daughter getting attention from a boy, the girl’s mother warned her not to make the same mistakes she did. Now, her father tells her, she’s the woman of the house, and she must do all the necessary things the woman must do: the cleaning, the cooking, the laundry. But there’s a lot more to being a woman than fixing dinner and doing the wash. Her mother was right: She won’t end up like her - and she’ll do anything to prove it.Remmy Rothstein Toes the LineAs an intrepid adjudicator of World Records, Mindy Patel has met lots of strange people in lots of strange places. But they’re no match for the Swampers of the Georgia bayou. Mindy has braved the oppressive August heat in search of Remmy Rothstein, who they call 'The Cajun Jew'. If the photos are indeed accurate, she might be about to certify Remmy as the World Record Holder for Longest Tongue in the World . . . and maybe even the Widest!First Mindy meets Remmy’s half-brother, Buell Rabinowitz, surely the world’s only one-legged, albino, Jewish African American. Then she makes the acquaintance of Remmy’s mother, a foul-mouthed old woman with an impressive beard. None of which prepares her for an eyeful of Remmy: a man who measures up to his singular reputation in ways that will change the course of Mindy’s life.My verdictI don't usually read short stories, but I am a big fan of Karin Slaughter's Will Trent and Grant County series, which is why I wanted to read Three Twisted Stories.The book contains three stories - Go Deep (the longest story, with nine chapters), Necessary Women and Remmy Rothstein Toes the Line. Each story is well written and highly readable and I didn't feel like I was missing out by not reading a longer novel.Go Deep was my favourite of the three stories. It was a little slow to start with, but then picked up. It is dark, off beat and good fun. A great satirical tale.Necessary Women was short but certainly not sweet. It was very dark and very cleverly thought out.Remmy Rothstein Toes the Line was my least favourite, although that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. I just found the story didn't flow as well as the other two in the book. I thought the author was trying too hard to make it humorous. However, I loved the ending.Karen Slaughter fans will find Three Twisted Stories to be completely different from her usual offering.

The ex-SAS soldier is searching for peace, but trouble soon appears when Kristen Hall, a young journalist, is brutally murdered right in front of him. Unable to prevent it, Ben is driven by guilt to hunt down the killers. All he has to go on is a handful of clues from Kristen's research - but how can the journals of Lady Stamford, the wife of an English lord during the time of the Irish Great Famine, have put Kirsten in mortal danger?Ben's quest for the truth leads him across the world and finally to Oklahoma, USA, where a deadly secret awaits. What connects the journals, a wealthy American politician and an intrigue surrounding the Irish famine?When Ben uncovers is a shocking historical conspiracy linked to the deaths of some two million people: a veritable holocaust that time has all but forgotten. Those who are still profiting from the lies and corruption of the time, and who are ready to kill anyone to protect their secret, are about to pay...My verdictBen Hope is my ideal action hero, with his military training, determination and caring nature. I am always surprised that Scott Mariani's series doesn't get as much media coverage as Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. I am a big fan of both characters, but find that Ben Hope is a much more attractive character due to his sensitivity and vulnerability.The Forgotten Holocaust is the 10th book in the Ben Hope series. It combines everything I enjoy in a book - an interesting underlying historical story, a fast-paced plot, a modern-day action figure, strong female characters and some blood and gore. The only aspect missing was a hint of romance, but Ben Hope is recovering from a past relationship, so that's been put on hold - hopefully only until the next book.I found the background of the Irish Potato Famine fascinating, as this isn't an area of history that I am particularly familiar with. Scott Mariani seamlessly weaves the history and action together. His descriptive passages are highly visual and no word is superfluous. I read The Forgotten Holocaust in one sitting - I couldn't put it down and the book flows from beginning to end.I am looking forward to the next Ben Hope book - The Martyr's Curse - I hope it isn't too far away.I won this book in a a Goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review."},

They had all taken turns to dig. An adult-sized hole would have taken longer. An innocent life had been taken but the pact had been made. Their secrets would be buried, bound in blood…Years later, a headmistress is found brutally strangled, the first in a spate of gruesome murders which shock the Black Country.But when human remains are discovered at a former children's home, disturbing secrets are also unearthed. D.I. Kim Stone fast realises she's on the hunt for a twisted individual whose killing spree spans decades.As the body count rises, Kim needs to stop the murderer before they strike again. But to catch the killer can Kim confront the demons of her own past before it's too late.Fans of Rachel Abbott, Val McDermid and Mark Billingham will be gripped by this exceptional new voice in British crime fiction.My verdictIt's highly unusual for me to find a book that leads me to put my life on hold. But Angela Marson's Silent Scream has led me to virtually abandon work for the last day, even with deadlines looming, leaving my house a mess and the ironing pile untouched.Silent Scream kept me guessing from the start, with its intelligent well-planned plot line, believable yet suitably flawed characters and a constantly flowing pace to keep me intrigued. It is highly readable and I love the references to forensic/forensic archaeology as this is a particular interest of mine. I also enjoyed the dynamics between the central characters (e.g. Stone and Bryant), providing some light humour in this dark tale.DI Kim Stone is a strong character. She follows her convictions, rather than orders from her seniors, but with enough integrity to keep her on the job. She is courageous, but also loyal and vulnerable. Her tragic past is revealed gradually throughout Silent Scream, helping the reader to understand the background to her vulnerability.Crime fiction and psychological thrillers are my favourite genres. Silent Scream ticks all the boxes for a 5* rating from me: a well written flowing story; strong but vulnerable protagonist; fast pace; intrigue; twists and turns until several final OMG moments; plenty of action; and the revealing of a brutal murderer.There are still many questions to be answered about DI Stone, which I expect would be covered in a sequel. I hope that Angela Marsons has another visit to DI Kim Stone planned in the near future.I received this as an Advance Reader Copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

But one day, Milli's mum leaves her alone beneath the Ginormous Women's underwear rack in a department store, and doesn't come back.Agatha Pantha is an eighty-two-year-old woman who hasn't left her home since her husband died. Instead, she fills the silence by yelling at passers-by, watching loud static on TV, and maintaining a strict daily schedule. Until the day Agatha spies a little girl across the street.Karl the Touch Typist is eighty-seven years old and once typed love letters with his fingers on to his wife's skin. He sits in a nursing home, knowing that somehow he must find a way for life to begin again. In a moment of clarity and joy, he escapes.Together, Millie, Agatha and Karl set out to find Millie's mum. Along the way, they will discover that the young can be wise, that old age is not the same as death, and that breaking the rules once in a while might just be the key to a happy life.My verdictLost & Found is very quirky - completely off the wall in fact. It's full of bizarre characters and an unbelievable storyline. In some ways, it reminded me of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce. However, while I enjoyed Harold Fry and found it gentle and touching at times, I found Lost & Found was rather odd (if not alarming).This is the story of seven-year-old Millie, whose mother has abandoned her in a department store. Sometimes Millie's thoughts and actions are those of a much younger child; at other times, her thoughts are way beyond her years. Millie is a very strange, although endearing, girl, with an unnatural obsession with death. I don't know any seven year olds who would stay in the department store over night if their mother didn't return, which gave the book a lack of credibility from the outset.I assume that the book is intended to be funny, but I thought that the older people - Karl and Agatha - were completely irresponsible and rather disturbing. They should have reported Millie to the authorities for her own safety, and they often discussed adult subjects such as sex in a way that was inappropriate for the ears of a seven year old. All of the characters (other than Millie) were shallow and seemed cartoonish rather than rounded and realistic. The ending seemed rushed and incomplete. I also found the use of italics for the dialogue difficult to follow.Overall, this is a unique story, but the book was a little too bizarre for my liking.I received an Advance Reader Copy from NetGalley."},

The visitors are assured by their Chinese hosts that they will be struck with wonder at these beasts, that they are perfectly safe, and that nothing can go wrong. Of course it can't…GET READY FOR ACTION ON A GIGANTIC SCALE.My verdictAs promised in the publisher's description, The Great Zoo of China certainly gives you action, as well as blood, gory deaths and destruction. If you like action movies, then this is an ideal book for you. The Great Zoo of China reminded me of Jurassic Park - not the book (which I haven't read) but the film. Once it starts, the action doesn't stop, right through to the end.It was obvious from the first chapter that this book was going to end in disaster. Some of action scenes were so over the top and far fetched that I found them hilarious. Eventually though, the book descends into fantasy more than action thriller, with its implausible storyline.Most of the characters die off by the end, but it's obvious early on which ones are likely to survive. CJ started off as a believable character, with her scarred face and expertise on reptiles. But then it all goes downhill. I certainly didn't expect a herpetologist turned vet to become such an amazing action figure, with her ability to operate weapons and literally 'dive' out of precarious situations. She saves the day virtually single-handed.I received an Advance Review Copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."},

Josa Young carefully weaves in stories of love, hate and tragedy, and how these shape the lives of each generation. She addresses the complex relationships between mothers and daughters, as well as issues such as rape, abortion, birth defects, mental illness and abandonment.The book is written with vivid descriptions of each time period, ranging from the 1930s to the present day. Each character had their individual strengths and weakness. Sarah, the matriarch of the family, had the most resilience. Melissa is the fragile one, while Damson has the most determination. The character I liked the least was Mellita, but this may be because her character didn't get enough page space to develop fully.The book begins and ends with the story of Damson, which made the book come full circle and seem complete. Overall, this is a powerful family saga and I hope to read Josa Young's previous book, One Apple Tasted, in due course."},

I am afraid. The only thing that I can think about is Vero. I know I have to save her but why couldn't I find her? She's just a little girl.The man standing in my hospital room tells me we are married but there is no Vero. That six months ago I suffered a traumatic brain injury which caused changes to my personality. I have dramatic mood swings, an inability to concentrate and large gaps in my memory. I'm much easier to anger these days. And I drink. All of which he says explains the car accident and my confusion.Now a Sergeant Wyatt Foster is investigating. He has questions about the car accident. He has concerns about my husband. And he's worried about a missing girl.He would like to know what happened to me. So would I.My name is Nicky Frank. This is my life.Watch me crash and burn.My verdictI have been a fan of Lisa Gardner for many years, enjoying in particular her DD Warren books. This the third in her Tessa Leoni series.I was gripped from the first chapter of Crash & Burn, with its vivid description of the car accident and Nicky's escape. The book is well written to keep up the fast pace and tension. I could feel Nicky's desperation and panic.Nicky Franks has suffered several traumatic brain injuries, which have affected her memory and behaviour. She has a husband, Thomas, who seems to be protecting her from something, although it's not clear what that is. And she has no other family or friends. She is obsessed with finding a little girl called Vero, but there's no evidence that Vero exists. I wanted to unravel her mysterious past as much as the police officers investigating her case.At first I thought she was in an abusive relationship or was being held against her will in a loveless marriage. But it's clear as the book progresses that there is far more going on. There are many twists and turns in this dark complex psychological thriller, leading the reader back and forth across many different paths.It's a horrifying and complex story and definitely not a light read. There are a few unconvincing plot lines and it was a little confusing in places. But overall another great read from Lisa Gardner.I received this book as an Advance Review Copy from NetGalley."},
{"title": "The Curvy Girls Club by Michele Gorman", "date": "Saturday 31 January 2015", "text": "The Curvy Girls ClubBy Michele GormanPublished by Avon Books UKISBN: 978-0007585625Goodreads descriptionWhen the pounds start falling off Katie, founder and president of London's most popular social club for the calorie-challenged, it seems like a dream come true. But as the overweight stigma recedes and her life starts to change, she faces losing more than the inches around her waist. Everything that's important to her - her closest friends, boyfriend, and acceptance into the club itself - are at stake in a world where thin is the new fat.A funny, heart-warming story about overcoming the prejudices we hold, no matter where we tip the scales.My verdictBeing no stranger to dieting, I could relate to this group of women who realise that their lives are being consumed by a relentless desire to lose weight, as a means of fitting in with the modern 'skinny' society, rather than having any fun and living life to the full. The book is well written and made me laugh from the start, with its descriptions of the slimming club and its members.During the course of her book, Michele Gorman covers fad diets, from cabbage soup to Special K cereal, licensed diet aids from pharmacies and illegal diet pills bought online. She isn't afraid to highlight the emotional distress experienced by overweight people: the loss of self-esteem and the social stigma attached to being a plus size figure. I enjoyed it when the tables are turned towards the end, and one overweight character reveals her prejudice of thin people, showing that prejudice can be directed towards anyone if they don't fit the accepted 'norm'.Many chick lit books can be rather negative about weight, taking the attitude that a character's weight loss during the course of the story is a positive step to finding romance. In The Curvy Girls Club, however, being overweight isn't a barrier to a relationship. Jane has a lovely caring husband, who loves her for who she is, rather than her size, while Katie's romantic interest fancies her before she loses a lot of weight.It was great to see a focus on a chronic treatable health problem. I rarely see conditions such as heart disease, arthritis, diabetes or, in this case, an overactive thyroid discussed in a novel. As a health journalist, I'm a firm believer in raising awareness, and getting people to talk about, these long-term conditions.Although written as chick lit, The Curvy Girls Club covers a wide range of more serious social and moral topics - domestic abuse, internet drug purchases, sexual discrimination in the workplace and bullying. However, due to the genre of the book, I felt that these are skimmed over and rushed rather than dealt with in any great depth. I also found that the book switches from being a story of celebrating your size, whatever it may be, to one of four friends falling out. The actual outings, which are the whole point of The Curvy Girls Club, seem to disappear from around halfway through the book.Overall though, this was an enjoyable read tackling some serious social and emotional issues surrounding weight.I won a copy of The Curvy Girls Club through a Goodreads Giveaway in exchange for an honest review."},

A terrifying psychological thriller that will chill you to the bone.A year after one of their identical twin daughters, Lydia, dies in an accident, Angus and Sarah Moorcroft move to the tiny Scottish island Angus inherited from his grandmother, hoping to put together the pieces of their shattered lives.But when their surviving daughter, Kirstie, claims they have mistaken her identity - that she, in fact, is Lydia - their world comes crashing down once again.As winter encroaches, Angus is forced to travel away from the island for work, Sarah is feeling isolated, and Kirstie (or is it Lydia?) is growing more disturbed. When a violent storm leaves Sarah and her daughter stranded, Sarah finds herself tortured by the past - what really happened on that fateful day one of her daughters died?My verdictI received this book as an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley.This is a haunting tale of mistaken identity (or it is?).The Ice Twins is a chilling, sad story of a family torn apart (and haunted) by tragedy, with many mysteries to solve. Is this just a confused little girl or something more sinister? What is the secret that Angus is so desperate to hide? And why is Sarah so fragile and confused about the events that fateful night?I couldn't put the book down and actually read it in around two hours. This ghostly psychological thriller reminded me of Diane Setterfield's The Thirteen Tale. It is beautifully written, keeping you guessing and wanting more, and I could picture the remote Scottish island and its surroundings. The intrigue began on the first page and continued non-stop until the last. Even the final chapter came as a surprise, to provide a satisfying conclusion.I could see this being turned into a film or TV one-off drama.I am intrigued to discover more about the author, as all of the available information about him/her seems to be shrouded in mystery.One of my favourite books of the year so far."},

When We Were Sisters follows the paths of two girls in North West London in 1979, as they turn into teenagers. The girls' lives change when two of their parents run off together to make a new life in Norfolk. When the women meet again as adults, over two decades on (in 2003), they (and their families) begin to address the past.The story of When We Were Sisters is complicated by the fact that one family is Jewish and the other is Catholic. I took an instant dislike to Laura, as she was very disrespectful of her step-family's religious observance and was intent on causing mischief, although her character did improve slightly towards the end of the book. I enjoyed the references to Edgware, where I grew up in the 1970/80s. However, I felt that the way some of the more observant Jewish characters were portrayed was a bit unrealistic.Overall, however, this was an enjoyable, quick and easy read."},

When the body of a girl is found, cut into three, Detective Inspector Edgar Stephens is reminded of a magic trick, the Zig Zag Girl. The inventor of the trick, Max Mephisto, is an old friend of Edgar's. They served together in the war as part of a shadowy unit called the Magic Men. Max is still on the circuit, touring seaside towns in the company of ventriloquists, sword-swallowers and dancing girls. Changing times mean that variety is not what it once was, yet Max is reluctant to leave this world to help Edgar investigate. But when the dead girl turns out to be known to him, Max changes his mind. Another death, another magic trick: Edgar and Max become convinced that the answer to the murders lies in their army days. When Edgar receives a letter warning of another 'trick', the Wolf Trap, he knows that they are all in the killer's sights...My verdictI received this as an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley.I have read the first book in Elly Griffith's Ruth Galloway series, but this standalone novel is completely different in its subject and approach.The Zig Zag Girl is set in the 1950s, focusing on a group of magicians and illusionists who tour seaside towns. This particular group served together in the war. The book reminded me of an Agatha Christie novel, with its well-written prose and gentle murder mystery approach. Around halfway through the book, I guessed the identity of the killer and what the twist would be. But this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story.Overall, The Zig Zag Girl was an enjoyable read. There was some humour and romance thrown in, although I would have liked more action. I felt that some characters (e.g. Edgar) didn't seem to have enough depth to them and came across as a little dull. I also couldn't understand why Edgar appeared to investigating such major crimes on his own (with the help of his magician friend), rather than with a whole cohort of other policemen."},

Over the last few days, I have cried at, laughed through and shared the memories of Saskia and her family.The Dandelion Years had me in tears from the first page, with its tragic underlying story and vivid descriptions of Suffolk life. The book follows the story of Saskia, her father and two grandfathers who share a home after a terrible accident strikes their family, and Matthew, a young man who has recently experienced the loss of Jacob, his mentor and father figure.Following Saskia's discovery of hidden wartime diaries, The Dandelion Years weaves these modern day relationships with the story of a young man at Bletchley Park, and Kitty, the love of his life.

But few clues are unearthed, and before long another young woman disappears.As locals continue to vanish, residents begin to discover that they might not know those closest to them as well as they had thought. Lies and insecurities quickly surface, leading everyone to question one another... and their involvement in the disappearances.Meanwhile, an unstable, twisted killer is hiding quietly in their midst. Ever since his mother's murder four years earlier, he's been forced to raise his disturbed teenage sister. He's terrified of her - and of women in general - and his world revolves around his fear of and obsession over them.In this USA Today bestselling thriller, debut novelist Jennifer Jaynes delivers a psychologically riveting page-turner that is packed with surprises and will have readers guessing to the very last page.My verdictI received an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I reviewed the revised Kindle version, which will be available on 27th January 2015. The paperback was published in November 2011.The fact that I enjoyed Never Smile at Strangers so much was a surprise, as I had heard nothing about the book until the author followed me on Twitter and I then noticed that the book was available for review on NetGalley. I am an active member of a large book club on Facebook (with over 1300 members, majority UK based) and no one has mentioned this book to date.Never Smile at Strangers is quite dark - it's set in a miserable town that, on the whole, is full of despondent characters. No one seems to have a particularly happy life. Then a girl goes missing and people start to question those around them...Virtually all of the main characters have secrets, which are revealed as the book goes on. My advice is: don't read this for light relief!The book focuses on several characters. At first, it felt disjointed but gradually all of the characters' lives came together. The killer is well disguised and his identity (and that of his sister) was a surprise to me at the end. Great twist.Never Smile at Strangers is well written and flows well. There are good descriptions, but nothing that I felt was excessively graphic.Very impressed that this is a debut novel. I will look out for more from Jennifer Jaynes in the future. And I will be recommending Never Smile at Strangers to like-minded readers."},

Finding a killer among the rival chocolatiers and potential suspects won't just be satisfying - it might save her life...My verdictI received this book as an Advanced Reader Copy through NetGalley. As a chocoholic, I wasn't going to turn down the chance to read a novel with chocolate at the heart of the storyline.This book is a combination of chick lit and a whodunnit. It reminded me of the Murder She Wrote TV series and Agatha Raisin's books, as well as being a lighter version of an Agatha Christie's Miss Marple novel. I was relieved that it wasn't a 'happily every after' and 'girl gets boy' ending, although the book came to a satisfying conclusion. The ending suggests that there will be another book in the series to follow this one.I am not sure how realistic the story is in terms of the criminal investigation. I was surprised that the police didn't conduct a full investigation, even if they suspected that the first death was accidental poisoning. And they also weren't interested when a second supposedly accidental death occurred.However, it's an enjoyable story and on the whole well written, although I felt in places stricter editing would have cut out some unnecessary waffle."},

For the last twenty-five years, she's believed that nothing could ever be as bad again.She was wrong.Now, still smarting from her recent divorce, pretty, self-effacing Jo finally gathers the courage to enter the dating scene. She meets Claudio, whom she vaguely remembers from her youth, but after a few dates decides he's creepy and politely tells him 'thanks but no thanks'.But Claudio has no intention of letting her go.Instead of never seeing him again, Jo wakes up sick and terrified, handcuffed to her own bed. She is given a week to prove her love for Claudio - or he will kill her.Claudio, it turns out, is a man with nothing left to lose.The Venus Trap tackles the emotional impact of divorce, the perils of modern dating and the age-old powers of lust and obsession.My verdictBeing locked in your own home by a maniac is a terrifying prospect, as your own safe house becomes your prison. In this book, it's compounded by the fact that Jo knows her jailer from her past and, most worryingly, she has let him back into her life after all these years.The book has a promising start from the outset, setting the scene, when Jo wakes up handcuffed to her bedpost, with her bedroom in complete lockdown, shut off from the rest of the world. Claudio is a frightening character; you could pass him in the street without even a second glance, with no idea about the monster lurking underneath his seemingly normal exterior.Jo has seven days to prove her love for Claudio - or as he phrases it: 'You have seven days to tell me you love me, in a way that I believe you really mean it. No bullshitting… If you don't convince me that you love me within seven days, I will kill you.'It's a frightening but well-written story. Claudio feeds Jo and looks after her (in his own demented way). But it doesn't take Jo long to discover his nasty side and for the situation to descend into violence.There are some great lines, such as: 'I will try to get inside his head. I just pray he won't take it as encouragement and try to get inside me.'Louise Voss made me realise - and think carefully - about how much we all carry around with us on our phones, tablets, laptops etc. Our contacts, diaries and social media are 'hidden' with just a few buttons and a passcode. With careful planning and timely observation, Claudio found it easy to learn Jo's secrets and gain access to her life. He forces Jo to read her diary, so that she can look back at particular incidents in her past. This triggers a whole host of emotions - love, fear, excitement and panic - and reveals some disturbing revelations (one of which I did guess!).This is my first Louise Voss book, although I have read some of her collaborations with Mark Edwards. I look forward to reading more of these soon.I received this as an Advance Reader Copy through NetGalley and from the author herself, in exchange for an honest review."},

A year has passed since she survived the ordeal, but Dana is still physically, emotional, and psychologically scarred, racked with bouts of post-traumatic stress disorder and memory loss. In an attempt to put herself back together after surviving the unthinkable, Dana returns to her hometown. But it doesn't provide the comfort she expects: she struggles to recognise family and childhood friends and begins experiencing dark flashbacks. But she's not sure if they're truly memories or side effects of her brain injury.Dana decides to use her investigative skills to piece together her past and learns of the events that made her become a reporter in the first place: the disappearance of her best friend, Casey Grant, the summer after high school graduation. Looking at her past and the unsolved mystery through the dark filter of her shattered psyche, old friends seem to be suspects, authority figures part of a cover-up. Dana begins to question everything she knows. What is real? What is imagined? Are we defined by what happens to us? And is the truth really something too terrible to be believed?My verdictI received an Advance Reader Copy (ARC) through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.The book starts off with an account of a violent act: a severe attack by a serial killer that results in the victim's disfigurement and brain damage. Unlike many other thrillers, this book concentrates on the aftermath of the tragedy and how the victim copes with getting her life back.After the attack, Dana was left with her memory in tatters. Now a year on, she begins looking into a cold case - the disappearance of her best friend 10 years ago- in order to give her own life meaning and her days purpose. As she comes into contact with people from her past, it's as if she is meeting them for the first time. So she doesn't know who to trust and has no idea that her own life may be in danger. As she pieces together the past, snapshots of her memory slowly return, leading her closer to the truth.The book was an easy read and came to a satisfying conclusion with revelations about the past. It provided an insight into post-traumatic stress disorder due to brain injuries caused by both criminal and military acts of violence; in particular, how the post-brain injury person is often not - and never will be - the same as the pre-brain injury person remembered by friends and family.I have read a few Tami Hoag novels and look forward to reading more in the future."},

I knew what it meant, that clasp and the mischievous grateful glance that accompanied it: it meant I was thanked, that there were secrets here. I could accept that. I too had secrets - who doesn't? Sent abroad to Egypt in 1922 to recover from the typhoid that killed her mother, eleven-year-old Lucy is caught up in the intrigue and excitement that surrounds the obsessive hunt for Tutankhamun's tomb. As she struggles to comprehend an adult world in which those closest to her are often cold and unpredictable, Lucy longs for a friend she can love. When she meets Frances, the daughter of an American archaeologist, her life is transformed. As the two girls spy on the grown-ups and try to understand the truth behind their evasions, a lifelong bond is formed.Haunted by the ghosts of her past, the mistakes she made and the secrets she kept, Lucy disinters her past, trying to make sense of what happened all those years ago in Cairo and the Valley of the Kings. And for the first time in her life, she comes to terms with what happened after Egypt, when Frances needed Lucy most.My verdictI received this book through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I loved the story and setting of this book, with its vivid descriptions of 1920s Egypt and the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb. I was transported back in time, able to picture the sights, smell the aromas and hear the sounds, as an elderly Lucy reminisced about her experiences in Egypt as a young girl.The book touches on the 1920s politics of archaeology in Egypt and the ownership of the contents of the tombs. But ultimately it is a love story - between several of the main characters and Egypt's history and treasures. There were also some complex relationships, particularly that between Lucy and her governess/step-mother Nicola Dunsire, which was hard to fathom.  While I give the book four out of five stars for its historical content and storyline, I did feel that, on occasion, reading the book felt like a chore, with unnecessary detail and a need for stricter editing. At 544 pages, it was a very long read. And at times, it seemed to go off on a tangent, with long passages about shopping expeditions, for example. Descriptions of Egypt gave the book its charm, but some long descriptions about other locations, especially in England, did become tedious and unnecessary. A couple of times I thought about giving up, yet I found myself wanting to finish the book simply to find out what happened to some of the key characters.Overall, I thought this was an interesting and emotional read and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, as long as they are prepared for a long journey to get to the end.."},

But as the publisher's description states, I didn't need to read the first book to understand what was going on and it can be read as a standalone novel.In this book, you are introduced to the killer early on. So unlike many of the crime novels I read, this wasn't a whodunnit mystery or a psychological thriller with twists and turns. Instead, it was a police procedural story, following a series of murders and the search for the killer. As the book progresses, you learn more about the motivation behind the killing spree. This is a story about revenge on old classmates. It made me think back to my own school days and how cruel children can be. As Mel Sherratt highlights in Follow the Leader, bullying can have a lasting impact on the victim, long after the perpetrators have moved on and forgotten their actions.Mel Sherratt writes well, with a mix of gritty crime and murder and gentle humour. I liked the main characters in the book and look forward to meeting them again.

In reality, the only true way to lose weight, and keep it off, is to eat less and exercise more. But this is easier said than done when you crave food all the time. This book focuses on how hormones affect hunger levels, what's driving your eating habits and why do you always feel hungry...In her book, Lowri Turner discusses that there are three phases of eating - hunger, eating and satiation. For some people, the hunger never actually switches off. This all sounds very familiar to me as I could eat all day long.First of all the book discusses how different hormones impact on hunger. This section was very easy to understand and well written. It established that cravings and hunger pangs could be due to sub-optimal levels of key brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, and hormones in the body, such as insulin and leptin.According to the questionnaire I completed, I am a mixture of three hunger types - Anxious, Never-full and PMS. Although I would actually consider myself to be the Bored hunger type too. The book then provides advice on rebalancing my hormone levels, depending on my hunger type, with tips on what and what not to eat and meal plans. This was followed by the 48-hour Hunger Rehab to follow, to rebalance my hunger levels and learn how to recognise true physical hunger, rather than hunger driven by other factors.There is a recipe section at the back of the book, split into breakfast, lunch, snacks and main meals. I will certainly be trying some of these recipes out, alongside the other recommendations (e.g. increasing my magnesium intake, cutting down on sugary foods, drinking green tea).An interesting read for someone who knows how to eat healthily but is struggling to lose weight because they simply can't stop eating!"},
{"title": "I Let You Go by Clare Mackintosh", "date": "Saturday 3 January 2015", "text": "I Let You GoBy Clare MackintoshPublished by Little Brown (6 November 2014; paperback on 7 May 2015)ISBN: 978-0751554168Goodreads descriptionA tragic accident. It all happened so quickly. She couldn't have prevented it. Could she?In a split second, Jenna Gray's world is shattered. Her only hope of moving on is to walk away from everything she knows to start afresh. Desperate to escape her past, Jenna moves to a remote cottage on the Welsh coast, but she is haunted by her fears, her grief and her memories of the cruel November night that changed her life forever.DI Ray Stevens is tasked with seeking justice for a mother who is living every parent's worst nightmare. Determined to get to the bottom of the case, it begins to consume him as he puts both his professional and personal life on the line.As Ray and his team seek to uncover the truth, Jenna, slowly, begins to glimpse the potential for happiness in her future. But her past is about to catch up with her, and the consequences will be devastating...My verdictWow, what a rollercoaster read.The book starts as a combination of police procedure and the start of a 'chick lit'-style romance. A child is run over and the distraught single mother, who is overcome with grief, runs away to remote Wales.But then the whole story shifted. I can't remember ever doing this while reading a novel, but I actually had to flick (or click) back to the beginning to check I hadn't missed something - maybe there had been a sign of what was to come. But I found nothing - this is an incredibly cleverly written story.From that moment on, I was glued to the book and couldn't put it down. There were so many twists and turns that I felt exhausted. Certainly a book to remember.If you haven't already read I let You Go, what are you waiting for… BUY IT NOW!"},
{"title": "A Flame in the Wind of Death by Jen J Danna", "date": "Saturday 3 January 2015", "text": "A Flame in the Wind of Deathby Jen J Danna with Ann VanderlaanPublished by Five Star Publishing (18 April 2014)Goodreads descriptionAt Halloween, Salem, Massachusetts is a hot spot for Witch and tourist alike. But when a murder spree begins, a cop and scientist must team up to find the killer before a media circus unleashes, panic ensues, and more victims are killed.Forensic anthropologist Matt Lowell and Massachusetts State Police Trooper Leigh Abbott are called in to investigate burned remains following a fire in a historic antique shop. As Matt, Leigh and their team of graduate students investigate the death, clues point to Salem’s traditional Witchcraft community. However, having dabbled in the Craft as a teenager, Leigh is skeptical that someone who has sworn an oath of good to all and harm to none would commit premeditative murder, let alone kill in such a vicious way.A second body is found in a similar fire and the team begins to suspect that coven members are being framed. Now they must solve the murders before 100,000 tourists overrun Salem for what could be the deadliest Halloween of their lives.My verdictThe prologue sucked me into the story straight away with its vivid description of a fire set by an arsonist.As the third book in the series, A Flame in the Wind of Death provided me with more background into the existing characters and an insight into what makes them tick. It also took the relationship between Leigh and Matt to a new level. Even the sex scene was beautifully written, neither smutty nor cliched.By reading the book, I learnt a lot about the forensics of fire damage and also a rare medical condition that was a key part of the plot. Again, as with the previous books, all of the science was well explained in lay terms but as part of the story so it didn't feel like a textbook.I enjoyed the ending and - as expected - it left me wanting more. This has become a new series for me to follow, and I look forward to the fourth book, which is being published next month (18 February 2015)."},
{"title": "Supercharged Juice & Smoothie Recipes by Christine Bailey", "date": "Thursday 1 January 2015", "text": "Supercharged Juice & Smoothie RecipesBy Christine BaileyPublished by Nourish (30 December 2014)ISBN: 978-1848992269Publisher's descriptionLooking for a simple way to boost your energy levels, improve your health, lose weight and feel fantastic? Supercharged Juice & Smoothie Recipes is an amazing collection of feel-good drinks using the latest range of superfoods to nourish and revitalize your body. Taking juicing to a whole new level with nutrient-packed health-boosting ingredients, Bailey uses an array of ingredients including sea vegetables, herbs, teas, and tinctures to help you supercharge your juice regimen. Using extra boosters in juices and smoothies is a simple, effective way to get your body into shape fast, providing fuel and nutrients for a transformed body and mind. Bailey (author of The Juice Diet) also provides a handy reference section at the back to help you quickly find recipes to lose weight, maximize energy levels, boost your immunity, combat ageing and look amazing. There is even a 3-day power-charged Superfood Juice Diet Plan to se you on your way to looking fabulous as well as feel great.My verdictI have to admit first of all that I haven't yet taken the plunge into juicing/smoothing. Not because I don't want to, just through lack of time. But having read this book, I realise that actually juicing isn't a time-consuming process, as long as you are organised enough to have the right ingredients and equipment to hand. Supercharged Juice & Smoothie Recipes is well-written and easy to browse through. The first part of the book discusses 'supercharging your life' with ingredients to reboot your health and the benefits of juices and smoothies. There is also a section on the basics - equipment, how much to drink etc - and another on your supercharged food pantry essentials, including algae, bee products, berries and fruit, herbs, seeds and medicinal mushrooms. The recipes are clear to read and well set out. I particularly like the Quick Look section at the back, to help you find juices/smoothies for specific needs: weight loss, energy, cleansing, immune boosting, radiance and brain health. Some of the extra supercharged ingredients may be difficult to source, although they may be available from some grocery stores, health food stores or online. As a juicing novice, I may improvise or cut out certain supercharged ingredients, sticking with the more basic recipes for convenience. However, I can see this book appealing to someone who is committed to juicing and improving their health and is prepared to put in the time, money and effort into the finding the right ingredients.NOTE: I received this through NetGalley as an e-book in exchange for an honest review."},
{"title": "No One Sees Me 'Til I Fall by Jen J Danna", "date": "Tuesday 30 December 2014", "text": "No One Sees Me 'Til I Fallby Jen J Danna with Ann VanderlaanPublished by Five Star Publishing (24 November 2013)Goodreads descriptionOnly the joint forces of science and law enforcement can help when a young woman is found brutally murdered with her identity erased.Massachusetts State Police Trooper Leigh Abbott and forensic anthropologist Matt Lowell come together to solve their second case when the remains of a young woman are found, thrown away like garbage at a local landfill. But what seems straightforward becomes something much more sinister when the victim’s bone damage reveals a shocking history of abuse. It will take reliving the horrors of Matt’s military background, all the team’s forensic skills, and Leigh’s intuition combined for them to catch the killer and give the victim the justice she deserves.My verdictI read this in one sitting - taking me only around an hour - as I couldn't actually put it down. It was just as good as Jen J Danna's first book, although a mini version as it's a novella rather than a novel. Still, it had all the same components - enjoyable storyline, forensic explanations and good characters. Having only just read the first book, it felt like a natural follow on, which is why I prefer to read a series of books (especially crime or thrillers) back to back until I run out of the books to read.This time the crime had a cultural theme, which was interesting in itself, although a sad background story. These books seem to be very well researched as well, which is probably what makes them so appealing.Looking forward to the next one.Dead, Without a Stone to Tell itby Jen J Danna with Ann VanderlaanPublished by Five Star Publishing (28 August 2013)Goodreads descriptionWhen a human bone is found on a lonely stretch of coastline, a determined homicide detective and a reluctant scientist risk their lives when they join forces to bring a serial killer to justice.Trooper Leigh Abbot has something to prove, both to herself and to the chauvinistic men in her department. She’s been assigned a difficult challenge: solve a murder where the only evidence is a single bone. To identify the victim and find the killer, she must join forces with forensic anthropologist Matt Lowell. Matt’s initial refusal to join the team is only the first in a series of setbacks.Matt and Leigh’s skills and tenuous partnership are tested when the evidence leads them to a burial ground of unidentified victims, where, to their horror, they stumble upon a freshly ravaged corpse. As the body count rises, the team must piece together a deadly puzzle spanning years of clandestine killings.Before long, the serial killer raises the stakes and Matt and Leigh find themselves marked as targets. Now they must stop the killer before they become the next victims.My verdictThis book was recommended to me by Elizabeth Haynes, author of Into the Darkest Corner, Human Remains, Dark Tide and Under a Silent Moon. I consider Into the Darkest Corner to be one of my top five reads in 2012, so I didn't take Elizabeth's recommendation lightly and immediately downloaded Jen J Danna's first book.Elizabeth suggested Jen J Danna's books when we were discussing how my childhood dream was to write a crime novel with plenty of forensics. I originally planned to study forensic science after my initial BSc in Biomedical Science, but I then switched to a MSc. in Science Communication instead and became a health journalist.It took me just one day to read this book. I loved it. It is an amazing debut. I enjoyed the descriptions and background of the forensic science, as well as the well-rounded characters and fascinating storyline. It makes me realise how some other best-selling series in a similar vein have become tired over time, with complicated stories and not much else.There was a great 'will they or won't they' dynamic between Leigh and Matt, without it becoming contrived or overly soppy. The forensic descriptions were informative without being patronising, and I learnt a lot about forensics just from reading the passages. I feel that I could read these books again and again without being bored (something I don't usually do), just to learn more about the science background.I am looking forward to reading the rest of Jen J Danna's books - in fact, I downloaded the next two straight after finishing this one. I have already read the first (a novella) - review to follow!After reading my review of Dead, Without a Stone to Tell It on Goodreads, Jen J Danna messaged me to thank me for my kind words. I find it fascinating that her background is immunology/virology rather  than forensics as I would have expected. And Ann Vanderlaan's background is also not forensics (originally teaching systems physiology, followed by 30 years of data analytics for the security sector).These books are perfect for fans of Kathy Reich and Patricia Cornwell.Welcome to Off-the-shelf Books, my new blog reviewing fiction and non-fiction books.Reading for me is an addiction - I can't get enough of it. In 2014 alone, according to my Goodreads reading challenge, I read 111 books (11 more than I expected). And I'm hoping to beat this in 2015.My Kindle is currently over-run with 232 books to be read, not to mention another 100 or so e-books currently waiting on my Amazon wish list. I have a selection of 'real' fiction books to read too, piled up on the shelf.Some of my latest reads have included:Bones Never Die by Kathy ReichDead, Without a Stone to Tell It by Jen J DannaBecause She Loves Me by Mark EdwardsDead Man's Walking by Paul FinchThe Sweetness of Forgetting by Kristin HarmelGarden of Letters by Alyson Richman.I enjoy a variety of genres, but I am particularly partial to crime fiction, psychological thrillers and historical fiction.I am also going to spending 2015 writing my first historical fiction novel and I look forward to the challenge.Better go, catch up soon. I have plenty of reading to do!"}
