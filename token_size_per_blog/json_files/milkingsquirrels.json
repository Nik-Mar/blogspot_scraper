{"title": "English Muffins", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2023", "text": "I've been thinking a lot about life back when ... ... when I was actively trying to homestead, just a decade ago.  FB regularly reminds of things I was doing to make our lives more self-sufficient.  One of my recent memories reminded me of the year that my goal was to can 200 jars of *something*.  I wasn't too terribly picky about what went into the jars.  What I mean is that my goal wasn't:x jars of picklesx jars of applesaucex jars of soup stockThe goal was to have 200 jars of home-canned food with the logic being that 200 jars would give us one jar of something preserved per day for the winter.  During the summer, we have the garden and stuff we can forage, but without some preserved food, if we lose access to our on-demand supply of groceries, we'd be very hungry.  One jar a day would keep us fed, if not full.  That said, not all jars of food are created equal.  That day when the jar was pickles, divided five ways, would be a much hungrier day than the day when it was canned chicken.Of course, THAT said, the ultimate goal was also to have 200 jars of home-canned goodness AND a pantry stocked with dried goods, like rice, pasta, and baking supplies.I thought a lot about that time recently, when I had occasion to visit my ancestral home deep in a hollow in the hills of southeastern Kentucky mining country.  I spent some time with my uncle, who is still homesteading the old homestead, and I brought home six quart jars of his home-canned tomato sauce, a bowlful of Chinese chestnuts we collected from the path under his chestnut tree, and a huge clump of Hen of the Woods (maitake) my uncle and I foraged from his woods.I didn't can any tomatoes this year.  In fact, I didn't even process any tomatoes for the winter.  I only grew grape tomatoes this year, and we ate them almost as quickly as I could get them off the vines, which were incredibly generous, but rather than preserve my harvest, like I should have done, I gifted a good portion of my harvest to a local friend.Looking at those jars of tomato sauce from my uncle and thinking about my very poor preparations this year had me kind of nostalgic for the way my life used to be ... before I started working a job outside the home ... when my JOB was the home.  In those days, most of what I fed my family was homemade in my kitchen, including the bread stuff.I haven't made a lot of bread recently.I missed it.So, today, I did. There's a loaf of applesauce bread cooling on the back of the stove, and these English Muffins will go into a lightly greased pan to fry until golden brown, as soon as they've had a second rise.  Then, instead of running to the store for breads, I can make Deus Ex Machina his daily breakfast sandwich for the rest of the week, with a couple of muffins leftover for both of us to have sandwich before music class on Saturday.Making homemade bread is time-consuming.It's, kind of, funny that my kids grew up and moved on, no longer needing me to facilitate their education or chauffeur them hither and yon, and some how I wound up with less time to do all of those things that I used to just do, because that's what we did.  Don't get me wrong.  I still cook, from scratch, more nights than not.  Eating out is very expensive, and we're saving up for retirement :), but also, as a loved one recently observed - when one learns to cook, especially if using fresh, local, in-season ingredients, the food just tastes better.  No offense to all of those restauranteurs out there, but the food I prepare at home is better.  It's always exactly what I want, exactly the way I want it, and I know what's in it, which means there's no chance of getting contaminated with ingredients that can make Deus Ex Machina's body hurt.  I still have my garden, and my chickens, I still make my own soap ... but I just don't spend as much time or energy doing the homesteading things I used to do - like canning. The first thing I learned to can, back when I first started down this path, was applesauce.  There's a bushel of apples in my kitchen, picked when my son and daughter-in-law visited at the end of September, which will end up sauced and dehydrated.  I figure, perhaps, going back to my beginning might get me back to where I was before I veered off the trail, when I started working outside the home five years ago.With the way things are going in the world, kick-starting my prepper life is probably not a bad idea.And home canned applesauce with pork chops from our pig share and oven roasted potatoes, just tastes better than anything mass produced and sold at the grocery store.What about you?  As life ebbs and flows, do you find yourself falling off of and climbing back onto your self-sufficiency path?  Do current events have you revisiting all of your homesteading efforts?"},
{"title": "Finding Solutions to a Unsolvable Problem", "date": "Friday, July 14, 2023", "text": "This morning, I woke up, as usual, at 4:30 am.  I got out of bed, did my morning hygiene routine, let the old tom out (he's the only of the three kitties who own me that likes to go outside), started the coffee water to boiling, prepped the French press for a new pot, and plugged in the iron.  Then, I fed the cats and dogs (after tom came back inside), added the now boiled water to the French press, and ironed Deus Ex Machina's work clothes.At some point during that routine, I started thinking about Medieval life (my brain works in mysterious ways - I don't question), and I thought how I would love if some English peasant were able to time travel to now, and I could host him/her in my home. I wonder what he/she would say about my house.It's modest by modern standards.  The average house size nationwide is just over 2000 sq ft and in my state is 1680 sq ft.  Mine is smaller by almost 200 sq ft than the state average, but it's adequate for my needs (and some days more than I can manage to keep clean (!)).  The average dwelling in the Middle Ages was between 600 and 1500 sq ft.  So, I guess my house isn't so big and luxurious by Medieval standards.But I do have an actual roof (as opposed to a thatched roof), indoor plumbing (including hot and cold water on tap), glass windows (that let in the light but keep out the critters and the weather, and help to keep the temperature more comfortable), and plush, comfortable furniture throughout.  Not to mention electricity for cooking, refrigeration, and lighting.  I wonder what someone from the Middle Ages would make of my house.  I think the biggest surprise, for them, would be to note that my house is \"mine!\"  It's not \"owned\" by a Lord (unless we count the mortgage that is owned by the bank ... hmm??!).Of course, then, I sat down to have coffee with Deus Ex Machina (which would probably be a luxury for a Medieval peasant, especially with the teaspoon of sugar per cup I add) and read the news, and there were two back-to-back articles.The first was dealing with the growing issue of homelessness - worldwide - but especially here in the US.  As of 2022, there were over half a million people who are defined as being homeless in the US, and per the article I read, the number is growing.  The article cited the main reason for homelessness was a lack of \"affordable\" housing.  That is, in most places, the cost of renting a place to live exceeds the ability for a too large portion of our population to pay for housing.  In his book, Tell Them Who I Am, anthropologist, Elliot Liebow attempted to shed some light on the homeless issue among a group of women who lived in a homeless shelter.  His book was published in 1993.  Thirty years ago.  What have we done as a society, to understand and fix the issue in the last thirty years?  Of course, according to this source, homelessness was an issue for the English pauper, too, with 20% of their population being homeless.  So, what have we done, EVER, as a culture, to stem the tide of those living without a proverbial pot-to-piss-in?If the growing homelessness trend is any indication, the answer is not much.The second article was about a lawsuit filed by property owners in New York City to lift the \"draconian\" laws that often favor the tenants over the landlords.  There are almost as many homeless people living in NYC as there are people living in Portland, Maine.  If those landlords are successful, how many more tens of thousands of people will be forced out of their apartments and end up sleeping in a tent (if they're lucky enough to have a tent) in Central Park (until someone comes along and forces them out)?In a neighboring city, those wishing to build housing units (including hotels) are required to include a certain number of \"affordable\" housing units or they can opt to pay a fee.  The city is flush with old buildings that were once working factories, and many entrepreneurial minded individuals have bought the old mill buildings with the intention of creating high-end apartments (condos) and luxury hotels.  Too many are opting to pay the fee rather than include affordable housing units in their plans. I am all for rehabbing old buildings, for sure.  I just wish there could be a happy medium between revitalizing a depressed, old mill town and pricing the long-term residents out of their homes.  I wish the pendulum could stop in the middle.  I have always been keenly aware of the homeless issue.  There was a time in my life that, by definition, I was homeless, but I was exceedingly fortunate to have a place to stay that was safe and stable.  That is to say, I have never had to sleep \"rough\", I have never had to live in my car, and I have never needed to take refuge in a homeless shelter.I have been blessed in my life, and I am grateful, every day, for the abundance I have been gifted.Working in a place where the public is not just welcome, but encouraged, I have become more intuned to the homeless issue.  Everyone knows there are homeless people in big cities, like Manhattan, Los Angeles, and Portland, Maine, but who could even imagine that in my little resort town, there are people who sleep under awnings and on park benches, and spend their days in the cool, quiet of the public library for a lack of anywhere else to go?  It's heartbreaking.  I don't know how to fix the issue.  I don't even know who to call when I am asked for help, because in too many places, like my town, there are very limited resources and services for the homeless population.  I guess all that to say, as a society, we need a better way of doing something than just throwing money at it, and I don't know what the answer is (I suspect there is no one-size-fits-all solution), but I'm open to suggestions.What can we do, as individuals?"},
{"title": "Vivacious Vittles - a Workshop", "date": "Saturday, July 1, 2023", "text": "When I started working part-time at the library, one of the things my boss wanted me to do was to organize some classes for our community with a focus on sustainability.  She knows all about my books, my blog and my lifestyle choices, and so she was super excited about the prospect of having me do *something*.At the beginning of June, I started a four week series called \"Vivacious Vittles\" in which participants learned to grow food in containers.  Small containers, actually.I live in a resort town.  The average-sized lot is less than a 10th of an acre with many folks having even less land than that.  There are a lot of condos, where there is no land, and if they're lucky, residents might have a balcony or a front porch, where they can have a few pots of flowers or the like.We also have a larger than average elderly population.  For whatever reason, this town is a haven for retired folks, and there are a number of 55+ communities.  As a demographic, people who live in 55+ communities are often on a fixed income, which means that being able to grow a little food is a good thing, even if it's just some lettuce in a bowl and some beans in hanging planter.And that's exactly what we did. The first class was planting lettuce in bowls. Yes, actual bowls.  I found some serving bowls in bright colors at the dollar store.  For the class, the participants poked drainage holes, then filled the bowls with soil. They were each given two bowls.  In one bowl, they planted lettuce starts and in the second bowl they planted seeds.The second class was hanging planters with beans and peas.  We planted pea plants, because it was late in the season and added scarlet runner beans around the edges.  By the time the beans are flowering,  they will have harvested and eaten the peas.  The third class was growing sprouts in a jar.  The last class was planting herbs in a self-watering planter made from an old wine bottle.Everyone had a lot of fun, and everyone took home both their plants and the knowledge that growing food doesn't have to require a piece of land or even a yard.  They can do a lot with just a few containers and a sunny spot."},

{"title": "Ode to an Old Cookbook", "date": "Friday, March 17, 2023", "text": "I may not have shared here, but over a year or so ago, I was hired as a library assistant at my local library.  It's been quite a lot of fun, and I find that I very much love the atmosphere in the library.  It's a good job, but it keeps me busy.  Not a bad or a good thing.  Just a thing.One of the things I love very much about my job is being around all of the books, and I'm not being facetious.  What I mean is that I am finding books to love that I didn't know existed, and that's thrilling. The happiest times are when a patron returns a book with the comment, \"This one was great!\"Such was the case last week, when a lovely woman handed me her stack of returns, pulled out the book on the bottom, and said, \"This was a great cookbook!\" I flipped through the pages to the index and asked, \"Did you make anything in it?\" She said, \"I copied the recipes.  Oh, and I made the pumpkin custard.\"I nodded.She turned and wandered off into the stacks to find more treasures, and I started looking at the recipes.  I decided in that moment, looking through that amazing cookbook, that I really love old cookbooks.  This one, in particular, was very cool, because the ingredients are simple, whole, and accessible.   Many of the recipes call for ingredients that I have, on hand, as a rule.Just flipping through the book, on page 192, is a recipe for Cranberry Crunch.  The ingredients are: 1 c quick cooking oats ... CHECK1/2 c flour ... (gluten-free flour, CHECK)1 c brown sugar ... (sub raw sugar, CHECK)1/2 c butter ... CHECK2 c whole berry cranberry sauce ... umm .... I have all of the ingredients, as listed, except the last one, and for that one, it would take about 15 minutes for me to make it on my stove, because I have whole, frozen cranberries, which I can: 1.  Dump in a pan.2.  Add 1 c water and 1 c sugar3.  Bring to a boil.4.  Cook until berries split.And DONE!One bag of berries is around a pint, which is around two cups.Dessert, and I don't have to make a trip to the grocery store.  Easy-peasy.What I was thinking as I was reading through the cookbook is that nothing in the book is terribly difficult to make.  It's very unlike that Meditteranean cookbook I purchased recently that calls for all sorts of fancy ingredients and long prep times.  I mean, I've made what I thought was Ratatouille, but according to the fancy Meditteranean cookbook, what I was making was something different.  At best, mine is a roasted vegetable dish (very tasty, but not what I thought it was).  True Ratatouille is a stew, and it's an all day cooking event that should be prepared in a clay cooking vessel, if one wants to be authentic.If those are the sorts of dishes we are expected to make, it's no wonder no one wants to learn to cook.  It's no wonder that so many of us turn to the experts and/or purchase processed/pre-made foods rather than delve into the wild world of home cooking.Enter the Mystic Seaport cookbook, with its easy recipes using simple ingredients where the prep time is about 15 minutes and the cook time is 45 minutes (during which one can be doing something else), et voila, dinner!I read an article today ... well, part of an article, because there was just too much doom and gloom in it to keep slogging through.I know, right?!  Too much doom and gloom for ME, means it must have been pretty dreary, right?I won't share a link, but the gist of it is that there are going to be a lot of people, this spring, who will be edging closer to that \"hunger cliff\" (the words the article used).  The article was about the cutting of nutritional supplement funds (or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps), which is going to mean that people who are already food insecure are going to be that much more food insecure in a few weeks.  This summer is likely to be brutal. When I was a graduate student, I was a very poor mother of two, and one summer, I applied for and received food stamps.  While applying for the assistance and using them at the grocery store was humiliating and soul-crushing (unnecessarily, so - just sayin'), having $300 to spend all at once on groceries was amazing!  I felt RICH!  Ironically. I don't know what other people buy with their food supplement funds, but I bought the biggest bag of flour I could find and yeast, and I made my own bread.  In fact, I bought a lot of stuff I didn't normally get to buy.  My typical weekly/monthly food budget was usually a lot less, and I had never had that much money for groceries all at the same time.I've done calculations before, comparing the price of ingredients to the price of prepared foods, and what I have always found - always - is that the ingredients, overall, cost less.  True, one can purchase two loaves of bread for the cost of 5lbs of flour, but that 5lbs of flour will make a heck of a lot more than just two loaves of bread.There are 18 cups of flour in a 5lb bag.  One loaf of bread takes four cups of flour.  That's four loaves of bread, plus two more cups of flour for other stuff, for the price of two loaves of bread.  I mean ... why buy bread with all of the preservatives and additives?Additionally, if one spends all of one's money on bread, one is limited to eating bread.  With whole ingredients, like flour, the possibilities are exponentially increased.  If I have flour (and a few other ingredients), for instance, I can make sandwich bread, biscuits, English muffins, bagels, cookies, cakes, pancakes, waffles, pie crust, and pizza crust.  With a couple of eggs and water, I can make pasta.  Flour, butter, sugar, salt, and water makes crackers.  Melt some butter in a pan, add some flour for a roux, add water or milk, and I have gravy, which is both filling and comforting ... especially over bread. There was an article recently about changing one's mindset regarding food.  The gist was that a bread and water diet can be toast and tea - with a different mindset.   Doesn't toast and tea sound so much more ... delicious!  What I hear from people about why buy the prepared food instead of the ingredient is that cooking takes a lot of time, and ... well, that's not entirely true.  Sure, a ready-made cake from the bakery (that costs $20) is much faster than baking a cake at home, but if one is baking that cake from a boxed cake mix, is there really a time savings?  If I'm using a box cake mix, I still have to mix it with eggs, oil, and water, pour it into a prepared pan, and bake it.  It doesn't take any more effort or time to dump some flour, salt, and baking soda/powder into a bowl than it does to open the cardboard box and the plastic bag the cake mix comes in.  And if I have flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda, I can make a lot more than *just* a cake.I guess most of the people who read here already know and agree with what I'm saying, but it is not a bad idea to remind us why we do what we do.  We cook from scratch, using whole ingredients, because we know that cooking is a skill.  It's not about what or how we eat, or even about what or how we prepare it.  It's about resiliency.  If I already have an \"I can make that\" mind-set, then even if I find myself with a smaller grocery budget (or with a food sensitivity that requires I change my entire diet), I can still eat, and eat well, and spend a lot less money buying the food I want.  Does anyone remember that amazing scene at the end of part one of Gone with the Wind, where Scarlet O'Hara is standing in the ruins of her garden with the sunsetting behind her.  She is clutching a measly carrot - the only thing she could wrest from the parched and trodden earth.  She holds this pitiful little root to the sky and declares, \"As God is my witness, I will never go hungry again!\"Not to iconize Scarlet - she was not a good person - but her determination is admirable, and while we may not want to model her conniving behaviors, we can be just as determined and resilient, and yes, we can declare that we will never go hungry .... Not by manipulation and treachery, but by changing our mindset to one of abundance in the face of scarcity.And by thumbing through an old cookbook."},
{"title": "Five Ways to Prep for Retirement that Don't Include a Bank Account", "date": "Monday, March 6, 2023", "text": "I read an article this morning about apotential bank “bail-in.”  The gist is that if the economy startsto really take a tumble and one of the big four banks (JP Morgan,Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo)  goes down, thelikelihood that the government will start drawing money out ofpersonal, individual accounts is … well, likely.  Again accordingto the article, FDIC bankers talked openly about a bail-in as astrategic option.  As the article points out, it's happened, oralmost happened, elsewhere (Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus), and itcould happen here.  Anything canhappen, right?Chances are prettygood that the banks won't take all of the money we've entrusted intheir care, but they could take a portion of it, to which they arenot entitled, via a government tax.I have been astay-at-home mom with a part-time income for over two decades.  Assuch, I haven't had an employer-based retirement fund, nor have Istarted my own retirement fund.  Frankly, until recently, I alwaysthought I still had time. Then, my youngest child reached adulthood,and suddenly, I am keenly aware that I am not getting any younger.  Oops!Last year sometime,I started looking at my options for a retirement fund.   At my age,there is not much of a chance that I will be able to save enoughmoney to keep me anywhere close to my current level of spending,which means I can either keep working until I die, or I can find waysto not need so much money.At that time, DeusEx Machina and I set up a spreadsheet so that we could look at somenumbers.  If we invested 6% of my income in an IRA at currentinterest rates, I would have about a year's worth of salary savedwhen I reached retirement age.  I might be to pay cash for a used car… or if costs keep going they way they are, a dozen eggs.If Iwaited another ten years to start withdrawing the money, and I onlytook out enough each month to cover my (current) property tax, itwould only last 8 years after I started withdrawing money.  Lookingat those numbers is incredibly depressing.  Money sure doesn't growas fast as it spends.Like me there is a disturbing number ofindividuals who don't have any personal savings.  Almost one-fifth ofour senior population depends solely on the federal social securitysystem for financial support.  It's usually not enough, and manyseniors, these days, are taking low-wage jobs just to make ends meet.Experts are full of great advice on howand how much we should be saving toward retirement.  According to thesecond article, if one earns an annual salary of $74,000, one wouldneed to have saved $1.3 million for retirement, which works out toover $900/month or $11,000 per year in savings, starting very young. At my age, $900/month wouldn't be anywhere near a million dollars. For us, putting that kind of money into a savings account and stillkeeping a roof over our heads and food in our mouths has just neverbeen possible.Experts advise us to start saving forretirement earlier rather than later.Yeah … well, that ship sailed withoutus.The fact is that it becomes even moredifficult to START saving the older one gets, and when one is my age,if one doesn't already have some savings, whatever one is able tosave from this point forward isn't going to go very far anyway. Sometimes any little bit doesn't really help.  What's that saying,rob Peter to pay Paul?  That's how starting to save at my age canfeel.Instead of putting $900 a month into anaccount, where the money may not be secure, I could, right now, beinvesting in my future in very real ways that will make my futuremore secure and more comfortable.Here are five ways Preppers (or anyone)could be investing that don't involve putting our hard-earned dollarsinto a savings account.1.  Pay off mortgage In her provocative tome, PossumLiving, Dolly Freed describes the low-income lifestyle she andher father enjoyed when she was a teenager, which they called “possumliving.”  In 1975, the poverty threshold for a non-farm family offour was $5,500.  Dolly and her father lived on a paltry $700 peryear.  I read her book.  It doesn't sound like they were suffering.  At very least the up-beat tone of the book belies any notion thattheir lack of income was detrimental to their physical orpsychological health.  In fact, Dolly and her father were both, ifthe book is to be believed, physically fit and very happy.In the first chapter, Dolly admits thatthe only reason she and her father were able to cultivate andmaintain their lifestyle was that they owned their home.  They didn'trent, and they didn't have a mortgage.Based on that book, alone, the bestthing one can do, if hoping to live well in retirement, is to makesure that one has a cost-free place to live.Numerous articles discuss the issueswith senior poverty.  Social security is less than what a person canmake working a full-time minimum wage job.  If that's true, a seniorcitizen who only has social security will be subsisting on about$1200 per month.  If one has to pay rent or a mortgage out of thatamount of money, it might not actually be possible to subsist on onlythat.  As such, paying off the house and living rent/mortgage freewould be a huge step in the right direction.I may have to still pay property taxes,but at the moment, the property tax on my house is one-fifth of mymortgage payment.  Renting a comparable property would cost fifteentimes what my property tax is.  Renting a one-bedroom condo (with noyard) would be six times the cost of my property tax.In short, I am much better off owningmy home, and the extra bonus is that if I find myself short of cash,I have enough house that I could get a roommate to help defray thecosts.I could invest in a retirement savings,or I could pay off my house.  The latter is, in my opinion, a muchbetter choice.The best thing I can do for Old Wendyis to make sure that she has a place to live that doesn't cost her anarm and a leg.2. Reduce the cost of utilities/invest in an alt energy systemGoing hand-in-handwith paying off the mortgage is reducing/eliminating one's otherbills.Here at ChezBrown, we are already doing without cable television.  The fact isthat the library has all of the video entertainment I could possiblywant, including a streaming service, and it's FREE!We have worked foryears to reduce out electricity usage, and at one point, had our billdown to around $50/month, half of which was the “delivery fee”for CMP to maintain the lines that brought electricity to our house. Unfortunately, over the past three or so years, our usage and costper watt has increased quite a lot, and we're looking atalternatives.What we have toask ourselves is, what do we really need electricity for?  As I'mwriting this, the electricity is out due to a huge windstorm.  I havea laptop, that's running on battery power right now, and when I getready to upload this article to the internet, I will use my cellphonehot spot.  The amount of electricity I need to power my lap top andmy phone could be easily generated by a single solar panel.  Our(hopefully very near future) alternative energy equipment will besized according to what we absolutely need, appliance-wise.We can alsocontrol how much water we use, and while the water company has beenincreasing our rates for a lot of years, there are things we can do. In the spring (after the thaw), summer, and fall, we can use our rainbarrels for watering the gardens and the animals.  And there aredozens of ways to use less water, like taking faster showers andturning off the faucet.Reducing ouroverall footprint with regard to electricity usage and water usagewill be valuable to Old Wendy.  The less one has to pay for thosebasic things, the less money one needs to live comfortably.So, instead ofspending $100/month on a retirement account, one could put thosefunds toward setting up an alternative energy system, and then, livewithout paying an electric bill for the rest of one's natural life. It would take half as much time to save up the cash to pay for analternative energy system as it would to save enough to pay off mytaxes for eight years after I retire.3.  Learn to grow food/forageOne of the biggestproblems that I hear for the elderly is having enough food, andthat's especially true with today's sky-rocketing food prices.  Iread an article in which the author recommended that the elderlyutilize food pantries.  I don't disagree, exactly.  The service thefood pantries provide is invaluable to a lot of people.  The problemis that relying on a food pantry for all of one's dietary needs isfoolhardy.  Food pantries aren't designed to be an alternative to thegrocery store.   The function of a food pantry is to provide asupplemental food source for low-income individuals AND to keepedible food out of the garbage.  It isn't meant to be a substitutefor grocery shopping or other sourcesof food acquisition.What can be a muchbetter supplemental food source, though, is a garden.  There is amisconception that one needs a large piece of land, and that simplyis not true.  In fact, there are plenty of examples of people growingfood in very small spaces.Having a garden isa hedge against bad times, and I'm finally figuring a few things out. Potatoes grow really well in bags.  Actual seed potatoes are muchbetter than trying to reuse those grocery store potatoes that growlong and spindly in the cabinets.  Diatomaceous Earth is awesome.  Inever plant enough garlic.  Raised beds, straw bale gardens andcontainer gardening are the best methods for my small space, and Ishould stop trying all of the other techniques I've tried and failedat.Which actuallyworks to my point.  Those methods of growing are easier and yieldmore for me, but they are also easier for older people.  Raised bedsand straw bale gardens don't require all of the bending, stooping,and tending that a traditional garden with rows requires.But also, having agarden is a very cheap way to supplement one's food supply.  When Iwas volunteering at the pantry, we had a couple of elderly clientswho also had a plot at our local community garden.  We didn't seethose patrons for most of the summer, because they were able to growwhat they needed to supplement their diets.  With a slightly biggerplot and the ability to preserve some of their harvest, those patronsmight not have needed to use the pantry at all.One 4'x4' gardenbed can feed one adult two vegetables per day for the growing season. That's the statistic I've heard over and over again.  I have muchmore space than just two 4'x4' garden beds, which means that,depending on the crops I choose, I could grow enough vegetables tofeed Deus Ex Machina and myself for three-quarters of the year.  Ifwe keep raising chickens and rabbits and it's just the two of us, Icould raise enough protein (between meat and eggs) for the wholeyear.  If we forage the wild apples and berries we find and add themto the grapes, apples, blueberries, and raspberries we have growingon our property, we have plenty of fruit.  If we include maple syrup,we have completely rounded out our diet and the only thing we aren'traising is dairy and grains. The only reason wearen't more food self-sufficient right now is that there isn't enoughtime to properly grow and tend the garden, because we work, but sincewe already have the infrastructure in place and the knowledge, whenwe do retire and have more time to spend in the garden, we could besupplying nearly everything we need to have a calorie-rich, healthy,organic diet.  4.  Cultivate self-sufficiencyskillsDeus Ex Machina isfond of saying one either has time or money, but rarely both.  Moneyallows us to pay someone else to do the things we would/could do forourselves, if we had the time.  In retirement, the one thing mostpeople have is time, but it's best to begin learning those skillsbefore they become a necessity.Skills like: cooking from scratch, canning/preserving, butchering animals, darningsocks, mending/making clothes, changing a bicycle tire (and riding abicycle, if that's not something one learned as a child), sharpeninga knife, cutting one's hair, cooking without electricity or gas,building a fire, turning tree sap into syrup, making soap, tincturingherbs for medicine, fermenting vegetables (for preservation andhealthier food), making cheese and yogurt from milk (to preventspoilage and waste), and doing small home repairs (like painting thehouse, changing filters, repairing a faucet, patching a hole in thewall).None of the aboveskills require great physical strength or are particularly difficultto do, but knowing how to do them, and more importantly, doing them,could save a great deal of money.For instance, weall know that cooking at home costs far less than eating out, butcooking from whole ingredients rather than buying the prepared foodsfrom the freezer section, also saves a ton of money.  If it's justthe two of us, and I still cook like I do now, one day of cookingwill give us three or four meals.  The leftovers can be packaged andput into the freezer or, depending on the food, put into jars andpressure canned for meals at some much later date.  Get stocked upenough, and we wouldn't even have to go to the grocery store, exceptfor the odd item here or there.  Retailers count on consumersspending more than they intended at the store.  It's built into thestore design for everything from the lighting, music, andtemperature, to the way the food is displayed.  They want you toimpulsively purchase that package of cookies or potato chips.  Notgoing to the store saves money just from eliminating impulse buys. I've already discovered that from using online grocery services likeMisfits and Boxed.com.5.  Stay Physically FitA few years ago I was having aconversation with a friend.  I said, “If my house is paid for and Idon't have any debt, and I am growing my own food and making my ownelectricity, what do I need money for?”  She said, withouthesitation, medical expenses.As someone who hasn't had very manymedical issues, I wouldn't have thought of that one, but the generalnotion in our culture seems to be that age is equal to poor health. In fact, an estimated 75% of people in my age bracket are takingprescription medications.  I guess I'm in the minority among half-centenarians.   But I approach health differently, I guess.A while ago, I went to the doctor formy annual physical, which included a blood test, nothing in theresults worried him, except my iron levels.  He recommended a stooltest, and I asked him why.  Low iron, he said, might indicateinternal bleeding.  I scoffed.  I have had low iron/anemia since …well, since I can remember.  It's not new.  If it's caused bybleeding, then, I've been suffering from internal hemorrhaging mywhole life.  Seems like there would have been other symptoms, if thatwere the case.  I declined the stool test.The two things that did worry me, atthat time, but didn't phase my doctor were my blood sugar levels,which looked high to me, and my weight, which was a bit more than Ihad thought.  I was surprised by how much I had gained.   I knew thatI was getting heavier, but since I don't own a scale, I pretended notto notice that my pants were a bit snugger than they had been andthat my aching knees were my age catching up with me.When I got those results, the firstthing I did was to reduce the amount of sugar I ate.  I didn't cutback on food.  I didn't count calories or go on a diet.  I just,simply, reduced the amount sugar.  No soft drinks (we bought a sodastream for seltzer water).  No sweetened tea.  No iced coffee with asugar sludge at the bottom.The second thing I did was to startgetting more exercise.  It started with walking in the mornings. Just around the neighborhood with Deus Ex Machina and our dogs. Then, Deus Ex Machina and I started doing 10 minutes of Yoga fivedays a week.  In nice weather, we have a number of regularactivities:  walking (with the dogs, but our old pupper can onlyhandle about two miles); biking; kayaking; and hiking.  Deus ExMachina likes mountains that are at least 1000 ft of elevation gain. He likes to go higher.  I like less elevation gain, but a longertrail.  I like to walk.  We also take dance classes and Qi Gong. When we added these activities to our lifestyle,  I lost 10 lbs andtwo pants sizes.None of the above is medical advice. It is simply what I did when I was confronted with medical issues.  Icould have done nothing, continued to gain weight, continued to enjoysugary drinks and snacks, tested positive for diabetes and beenprescribed a diabetes medication.  Maybe none of my changes will stopme from developing diabetes, but if it does, I've saved future Wendythousands of dollars in medication expenses.  Not spending my socialsecurity money on medication is cash in my pocket, and not needingmedications, means that I can survive on less cash.All of the above ways of preparing forretirement are cumulative, like interest ... only better.  Once .one starts doing them, thesavings start to pile up, both the savings in actual dollars, butalso the savings in stress and worry from not having an adequate bankaccount."},
{"title": "How to Thrive in the Suburbs, When the Grid Goes Down ... 'cause it will!", "date": "Monday, January 23, 2023", "text": "It snowed.Big, fat, wet, HEAVY flakes that aren't the kind Julie Andrews wants sticking to her nose and eye lashes.  Rather it's the kind of snow that is back-breaking to shovel and often results in downed trees and damaged power lines, both of which tend to disrupt people's lives.  In fact, a co-worker of Deus Ex Machina's had to find an alternate route to work this morning - as he said, \"looking for a road without downed trees.\"And, perhaps, worse, in town, less than two miles from where I live, many homes lost power this morning, which means that most of those people will be hunkering down and waiting until CMP can repair the line or fix whatever it is that's broken.  Losing power means more than just no television or electric lights.  For many it means life comes to a complete standstill; they are paralyzed, unable to do much more than wait.  Without power, even the simplest, most quotidian tasks (like boiling water for a cup of tea) become impossibilities, because most of us depend on electricity for EVERYTHING.  For me, that sort of dependence and lack of control is terrifying.  We lose power with enough regularity that it would be horribly disruptive, if we were wholly dependent on it, and for me, that's an uncomfortable feeling.  I do not want to be wrapped in six layers of clothes, huddling in a blanket in the dark, starving, dirty, and bored, because we don't have electricity.  Or worse, end up with a caffiene withdrawal headache, because I can't have my morning cuppa.So, I did something about it.  I made my lifestyle about preparedness - or maybe better would be to say that I looked at those things I need to be comfortable, and I found a way to have them without electricity.Don't get me wrong - there are things for which I depend on electricity to make my life a little easier (more convenient), like washing clothes.  I don't \"love\" my clothes washing machine, but having done clothes by hand, I am thankful for the ease and convenience of throwing a bunch of dirty clothes in the washer, hitting a button, and walking away.  Refrigeration is essential.  To be completely honest, my freezer is the primary way we preserve our food, because a significant part of our diet is meat, and if the harvest season gets busy (like we're in the middle of renovating a bedroom, but the tomatoes are coming in at the same time), I can put the extra produce in the freezer until I have time to deal with it.  I also do a lot of baking when we have a glut of eggs, and I will freeze the extra baked goods to enjoy when eggs aren't so abundant.  We don't have a back-up system for the freezer, but we do keep it fully stocked, all of the time, so that we have a couple of days of buffer before stuff starts to thaw to unsafe levels.  For me, a hot shower is one of life's greatest pleasures!  Which makes it both fortunate and unfortunate that we have an on-demand electric hot water heater.  We have unlimited hot water, if we have electricity, but when the power goes out, so does the hot water in the shower and at the kitchen sink.  I suppose none of those things is essential to our survival, but they are nice things to have, and I didn't want the very fragile power grid to dictate, to me, how comfortable my life would be.  So, I did some things to ensure that WHEN the power goes out, I'm not hamstrung until CMP gets around to fixing the issue on my low priority, side road.  Have I ever mentioned that one time that the only road in my part of town to lose power was mine, and it took two nights and three days to get it restored?The most important piece of my off-grid infrastructure is my woodstove.  It provides heat and has a cooktop so that we can cook and heat up water.  Our woodstove is our primary heat source.  We don't just use the woodstove in inclement weather or *if* we lose power.  It is a part of our every day life.  We use it for more than just heat, too.  We make our morning coffee using a French Press.  Add coffee grounds and hot water, et voila! in four minutes, we're ready to enjoy a steaming cup of heaven on earth! I always have a kettle on the woodstove, and so there is always hot water - no electricity needed!  I also regularly use the woodstove for cooking.  Most of my daily cooking is still on the electric stove in the kitchen, because everything is in the kitchen and it's more convenient, step-wise, to just stay in there, but I do enjoy putting a roast or a whole chicken in my Dutch oven, and letting it slow cook all day on the back of the woodstove.  In a lot of ways, it's better than a crockpot.  It's certainly less expensive, and more sustainable.  In a pinch, I can use (and have used) the woodstove for all of my daily cooking.  I've even baked on the top of the woodstove using a Dutch oven or an inverted pot to capture the heat.  In the immortal words of Ron Popiel, but wait, there's more!  I also use it for clothes drying.  I have a drying rack that I use in the winter, and it sits in front of the woodstove.  The clothes get dry, but the damp clothes also add moisture to the air.  It's a win-win.  And it requires zero electricity ... and is sustainable.A second very useful part of my off-grid infrastructure is lighting.  In emergency preparedness, it is recommended that one have flashlights and batteries, and candles.  I have both, probably, somewhere, but if we're being honest, those wouldn't be my go-to in a grid down scenario.  Instead, what I have are these bulbs* in several of my light fixtures, and, indeed, I purchased some inexpensive lamps from the Family Dollar, specifically, so that we could use the Boundery bulbs.  The bulb works exactly like any regular LED bulb, but as a bonus, these bulbs have a built-in battery.  They are actully charging when in regular use, so that when the power goes out, I will still have my lamp, exactly like I do on a regular day, when the electricity is up and functioning. I use those lamps every day, and the fancy bulb is just the bulb I use.  So, if the power goes out, and lamp stays on, and ... I don't have to think about it, and I don't have to search every hiding spot for that flashlight and batteries I know I put ... somewhere!For fun, I have kerosene lamps and kerosene, and a bunch of candles, and a couple of different styles of solar camping lights and lanterns.  The ones I have also have a USB charge option, and so if I have to use the lamp, but I can't recharge it with the built-in solar panel (because it's cloudy or night time), I could plug them into one of my USB chargers.A third part of my off-grid infrastructure is my connectivity.   My FB memory today reminded me that we haven't had a television since 2010.  It's been even longer since we had cable television.  For the record, we do use a streaming service.  We also have cellphones, but did away with our land line six years ago.What's different about us and other folks is that we don't connect our phones to our wi-fi when we get home.  Our phones ARE our wi-fi.  Instead of a cellphone bill, a cable bill, an Internet bill, and a bill for our streaming service, it's all lumped together ... except cable, and ... well, we don't have a television, so we also don't need cable.  The benefit is that, even if we lose power, nothing about the way we connect to the outside world has to change. We can still access our phones, still connect to the Internet, and still even stream movies or binge-watch Community.  We are only limited by our ability to keep our devices charged, and well, we have options for that, too.  I don't know how much the average user pays for cable, Internet, phone, and streaming services, because, for some reason, Internet service companies won't allow me to search their prices without giving them my address, which I'm not doing, because I don't want them to contact me, but the cost per month for our cellphone plan, which bundles all of it and includes a Netflix subscription with two screens, costs us $40 per line, and we can have up to four lines on our plan.  There's another benefit to having our connectivity through our cellphone service rather than a grid-dependent ISP/cable company, and that is that, working from home and doing online classes are possible, even without electricity. I was chatting with a friend today who didn't have any electricity at her house, and she lamented that her family member had to \"go to work\" in the storm, because he couldn't work from home with no electricity.  Fact is, for most of 2021, I worked from home over the Internet, and ... see above.  I don't have a \"normal\" Internet connection, but I had no problem doing the work that needed to be done, including connecting to my employer's virtual machines and/or downloading their files.  In short, I can heat my house; boil hot water; cook dinner; dry my clothes; have \"electric lights\"; write my novel; do a blog post; scroll Facebook; and watch Netflix - even if we don't have any electricity.    I guess the only everyday activity that I am not prepared to do if the power grid goes down is iron, and well, I'm thinking I need one of these. How much of your daily activities have to change when the power grid goes down?"},
{"title": "Wait ... he said DON'T stock up?  What the ...? What??", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2022", "text": "Finance guru, Dave Ramsey, has branched out, it seems, and he is now giving prepper advice. Well, not exactly, but this recent article, claims Ramsey suggseted five items that consumers should not purchase at the bulk buying store.  FruitsVegetablesDairyCondimentsSpicesThe impetus behind his recommendation is that, because those items are perishable, they are likely to go bad before they can be used, and tossing food is a huge waste of money, but ... I guess the assumption that we're just going to let it rot and then just toss it in a land fill is what bristles most for me.  To be fair, yes, occasionally I have purchased things that have ended up in the compost pile or been served to the chickens, but mostly, we eat it before it turns blue or it gets tossed in the freezer. Drying corn for popcornIn the fall, when we have a glut of eggs, and the temperatures are starting to get wonky, but it's too early to fire up the woodstove, I like to bake.  And sometimes I get a little carried away to the point that my family gets tired of having fresh cake every Monday.  Did you know that cake freezes REALLY well?  Yes, even cake that's been frosted!  So, I've found a way to preserve the excess of eggs that we were getting, and also to give us a treat (usually packed in a lunch) that we won't have as much of during the winter when the chickens stop laying as much.  Interestingly, one of our favorite cakes is applesauce cake, which requires spices (and apples).  In fact, lots of our favorite preserved foods call for herbs and spices, like salt, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and dill.   Dried herbs and spices can be incredibly expensive, and being able to save a few dollars by buying in bulk is a very good thing.  I don't just use herbs and spices in preserving and baking, though.  I use a lot of seasonings in my regular cooking, and I don't purchase spice mixes.  I mix and match my spices myself, which means I need bulk quantities of all of the spices I use regularly.  My favorites, and the ones I always try to keep on hand and purchased (or grown) in the largest quantities I can find, are:  chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, oregano, rosemary, dill, basil, thyme, sage, mint, pepper, salt, cinnamon, turmeric, curry powder, and tarragon.  Some of those are more expensive than others, but all of them are going to be overall less expensive when purchased in quantity. But what really twisted my knickers when I saw the recommendation was the FACT that herbs and spices have a pretty long shelf life.   According to this article, ground spices will last six months or longer, depending on the spice, and whole spices (like black peppercorns and cloves) last 10x as long.  According to this article, herbs and spices can have a shelf life of one to five years.  Salt will last indefinitely.  The recommendation to avoid purchasing bulk spices seems ... short-sighted, to me.Likewise with condiments.  I mean, sure, not buying a 40 oz jar of a very obscure condiment that most people may use once in a while, like curry paste, which I rarely use (but would use more often if we did more home cooking of Southeast Asian cuisine), but mayonnaise ...?  I make all of my own salad dressings and dipping sauces, and most of the time it's a mayonnaise-based dressing, consisting of mayonnaise, half and half, vinegar, and seasonings (recipe to follow).  I also like making my own honey mustard, and this article shares a basic recipe for a vinaigrette with variations, BUT all three types of vinaigrette in the article use Dijon mustard.  In this case, I am saving money both because I am making the dressings myself and because I save money by purchasing the ingredients in bulk.  Saving a few dollars per jar for mustard and mayonnaise to have extra jars on hand is a GREAT idea!  Just sayin'.  Also, I would like to point out that condiments, like ketchup, don't go bad fast.  This article explains that, stored in the refrigerator, a bottle of ketchup (which is mostly vinegar anyway) can six months.  In addition, in a worst case scenario, ketchup might prove useful for more than just adding flavor to french fries.   According to some accounts, during the Great Depression, it was a common practice to put ketchup in hot water for a poor man's version of tomato soup.  I mean, it wouldn't be my first choice, but in a pinch, I'd probably eat it.  Personally, I recommend ignoring Mr. Ramsey and just buy the condiments and the spices.  As for dairy, for some items, I might agree.  Others, not so much.  Like, my family doesn't drink a lot of milk, and when we do, I prefer to get it from a local farm where I can get it raw.  So, *I* wouldn't buy gallons of milk at the bulk buying store.  Cheese, on the other hand ...., and I actually do purchase cheese in 2 lb blocks already.  The key is to keep it in its original packaging, and like spices, unsliced cheese has a longer shelf life than sliced cheese.  So, get the big block and slice off what you need, taking care to avoid touching the cheese as much as is possible (cross-contimination can really take the shelf life out of the cheese!).  And then, there's this - most of the dairy products that one finds in the bulk buying stores can be frozen.   Freezing dairy extends the shelf-life to a couple of months, which is a very good argument FOR going ahead and snatching up that good deal on dairy at the bulk club.As for fruits and vegetables ... well, you know what I'm going to say.  Most fruits and vegetables can be canned, pickled, fermented, dehydrated, and/or frozen.  Or, if properly stored in a root cellar or unheated garage, can be kept for MONTHS.  I mean, isn't that exactly what our ancestors did with their excess produce?  And by \"excess\", I mean what they weren't going to eat before it spoiled.  Making pickles for winter storage was a thing for centuries before Vlasic put them on grocery store shelves.Worstcase, those fruits and vegetables overripen, rot, or otherwise become inedible, but it's not garbage.  It's COMPOST!  Those fruits and vegetables have a life after shelf-life.  So, while there may be perceived waste, because your family didn't eat it, it's not wasted if it makes compost for growing next year's vegetable garden.Fruits and vegetables that don't get consumed by my family end up going out to the rabbits or chickens, and, well, then, they do, eventually, feed my family.  So, there's that.  And giving those spent vegetables to the chickens means I save money on feed.  So, there's that, too.In short, I can't really get behind ANY of Dave Ramsey's recommendations for things to skip at the bulk buying club.Instead, let me give a few suggestions of things to avoid insetad.1.  Bulk packages of individually wrapped snacks.Yes, buying them at the bulk store WILL save money, BUT not buying the individual portions at all and opting for the big bag of chips and repackaging them into smaller portions will save more money.  There's also the fact that making it will be cheaper, always.  I did a cost analysis of an individually wrapped snack cake vs. my homemade cake.  Homemade cake is cheaper.  2.  Premade freezer meals.I love having things in my freezer.  It does save money in multiple ways:  having a stocked freezer means it takes less energy to keep it cold;  a well-stocked freezer means we're less likely to eat out, which saves money; depending on what it's stocked with, a well-stocked freezer can save time, which in some circles equates to money (i.e. time is money).Those premade meals, however, are just not a good buy.  Yes, they can save time, but wait.  Do they really?   Annie's frozen mac&cheese (arguably, yummy) cost $3.59 for a single serving.  It takes 30 to 40 minutes in a preheated oven to cook it.  Annie's shelf stable mac&cheese with the cheese sauce instead of the powder costs $4.49/box.  It takes 7 to 9 minutes to cook in boiling water, and it serves 3 people.  So, really, which costs less?  3.  Pre-cooked rice in pouches.Yes, it takes considerably less time to warm up pre-cooked rice, but come on.  Boiling rice takes about a half hour, at most.  Two cups of uncooked rice will serve four people.  One pound of uncooked rice is around 5 cups of rice.  So, if rice is $2.50/lb, one can feed four people for around $1.25.  Compare that to the cost of an 8.8oz package of pre cooked Uncle Ben's rice, which is $2.33 and only feeds two people.  Uncle Ben's precooked rice is 4x more expensive than just cooking the rice.  Does saving 20 minutes really make up for the extra cost of the precooked rice?4.  Bottles of pre-brewed individual servings of tea.A box of 100 tea bags costs $5 depending on the brand.  A half gallon of tea uses four tea bags, which costs about $0.20, and is about three and half 18 oz servings, which works about to around $0.065 per serving.  Compare that to an 18 oz bottle of pre-brewed tea, which is around $2, if one purchases twelve bottles at a time. I mean ....  Is there even a question as to which is more cost effective?   But then, there's the plastic bottle to recycle or throw away.  Put your home-brewed tea in a pint jar to travel, get more servings, save beaucoup d'argent, AND save the planet.  5.  Clothes/books.Maybe there's a cost savings over purchasing a new shirt at the department store, BUT getting it second hand at a thrift store will almost certainly cost less.  And books?  Maybe books at the bulk buying store are cheaper than they are at a national chain bookstore, but my local new/used book store has a $0.50 book table, and have you heard of the library?  Books there are FREE!  It doesn't get cheaper than that.  I'm a little disappointed in the suggestion that we should skip buying perishables in bulk, based solely on the notion that we might end up throwing them in the trash.  The reality is that IF we want to take advantage of bulk buying clubs to see a real cost savings, the best thing to do is to not be dazzled into buying sleek packages of uber convenient food.  In the end, the cost will be a lot more than the price of that wilted lettuce, and the convenience won't really offset the overall cost, either.  What do you think about Dave Ramsey's recommendation?  What would you avoid buying at a bulk buying club?Basic Ranch-style Salad Dressing:1 c mayonnaise1/2 c half and half (or milk or cream)2 TBS (or to taste) red wine vinegar (could substitute white wine vinegar)2 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder, dried basil1/2 tsp each salt and ground pepperMix well.  Store in the refrigerator in a sealed jar.Adjust the first two ingredients for thickness.  More mayonnaise makes it more of a dipping sauce.  More half and half makes it a more pourable dressing."},
{"title": "The Spirit of Christmas", "date": "Monday, December 19, 2022", "text": "Several years ago, I was tasked with writing an article for the blog on my publisher's website.  My publicist, who was being tasked with the chore, was at a loss, and I thought I could whip something together.  The topic was \"The Spirit of Christmas\", and below is my thoughts on the subject.May your days be merry and bright ....Originally published on December 19, 2013My youngest daughter turned eleven this year. In our eyes, of course, she is still just a little girl, but thereality is that she is becoming a young woman, and part of thattransition is to start to question those beliefs that she has alwaysheld.As a bit of background, when Eric and Iwere young parents, we had discussed the whole Santa Claus issue –that is, do we or do we not teach our children to believe?  Part ofour culture, especially this time of year, is to promote the magic ofChristmas by offering our young people this iconic figure who willgrant their deepest wish if they just believe.  As youngparents, we weren’t sure we wanted to perpetuate that myth.Unfortunately, we failed to make adefinitive choice, and instead allowed family members who adoredthose Santa traditions to teach our daughters that there was thiself-raised entity, who was always watching (which, in itself, is kindof creepy), and magically answered their deepest desires by bringingthem those gifts they received on Christmas morning. We got sweptaway in the flood, and even after those relatives were no longeractively participating in holiday traditions, we continued.Her older siblings are no longer askingthose questions, having quietly, without discussion with us, theirparents, determined that Santa is a figment.Over the past couple of weeks, as thebig day grows closer, my eleven year old has been asking thatquestion, and we have been waffling about what to say.  Do we popthat bubble and say to her, it’s not real?  Do we ignore thequestions and just let her come to her own conclusions?  Do we findsome other way to explain this cultural phenomenon?I decided to take a more proactive approach with her, not to ignore her questions and not to continue to lie toher.  She is getting old enough to really be able to reason thingsout, but the fact that she is asking tells me that she wants someanswers.So, I asked her, “What do you thinkabout Santa?”  And she told me that she thought Santa brought someof her gifts.  I asked her which ones.  She thought for a bit.“I think he brought those candy canesthat were in my stocking that one year.”“The ones you didn’t like becausethey were too strong?”  She nodded.I can only imagine that her mind foundthat gift, because it was incredibly unique and very different.  Itwas not the grocery store candy canes, but a gourmet style that usedreal peppermint oil as the flavoring – which is why they were sostrong.  Of course, those were not something Mom and Dad had plantedin the stocking.“When I was your age,” I told her. “My friends and I decided that Santa was the Spirit of the Season.”I explained to her that, when I was herage, my friends and I had decided that Santa was that little spark ofjoy and delight that was infused in this season of light and giving. He is the energy that makes us smile at one another, even when thereis a foot of snow on the ground, and we are slipping, and it is coldout, and at any other time of the year, we would be grumbling andgritching about the crappy weather or the insensitive lout who justpulled out in front of us in traffic.I was not lying to her, and I was nottrying to keep her believing in something that is not real.This season has been dubbed the Seasonof Giving, and the consumer culture we live in has grabbed thatslogan and plastered it on every product that is being manufacturedin an attempt to encourage us to spend more money and buy more stuff. It is very easy to get bogged down by the extreme commercialism thatthis holiday has become and to allow one’s disdain for the cultureof stuff to shadow that child’s wonder most of us once held.  It isreally easy to become bitter.It is just as easy, however, to takeback that slogan by adopting an attitude of giving ourselves.  Itdoesn’t have to be about buying more stuff, because gifts do notall come in big boxes adorned with big bows and garishly coloredpaper.“You know that family your dance teamhas adopted?”  She nodded.“We don’t know them.  I don’teven know their names, but we’re giving them a bunch of gifts. That’s the Spirit of Christmas.  That’s Santa.”In the story, The Polar Express, theyoung boy rides the Christmas train to the North Pole, where he meetsSanta, in person, and receives as a gift the sleigh bell.  As long ashe believes, he can hear the bell’s jingle.My daughter may not believe in Santa asa flesh-and-blood man who lives at the North Pole, employs elves, anddrives a reindeer powered sled, but she does understand that the joyof this season lies, not in having her every wish fulfilled, but insharing, her joy, her wonder, and her giving spirit with others.And I think, she may just always hearthat bell.

{"title": "Vintage Christmas", "date": "Sunday, December 4, 2022", "text": "I love this season!  The lights, the decorations (although *I* am not a fan of doing my own decorating, I love looking at other people's decorations :)); the giving and receiving of gifts;  the general feeling of well-being, kindness, and generosity that seems to float in the air like tiny snowflakes ... and yes, even the weather!  I love the cold, the snow, and that crisp, frosty feeling first thing in the morning.  The library is participating this year in our community Christmas festival, which includes visits with Santa and Mrs. Claus and the annual tree lighting ceremony.  We will be open during the festival, as one of the stops for the town-wide scavenger hunt and a warming station for those who will be in the adjacent park, but find that spending two hours outside is a bit much.  The Children's librarian is planning an assortment of activities for the littles, and my boss asked me to think up something for our older patrons.  I have known my boss for decades, and she is familiar with my books and my lifestyle.  Getting me on the staff was exciting for her, as an opportunity to bring more ideas for sustainability and eco-friendly lifestyles to the library.  She has been prodding me to come up with some program ideas for our adult patrons with a focus on sustainability, which is, of course, my métier.  So, when she said, \"Hey, let's come up with something for the adults,\" I started looking for craft ideas that wouldn't cost us anything in materials, and I found this paper Christmas tree decoration.  The template was free, and using old, rotting, water-damanged, and/or bug chewed books gives them that \"Christmas of Yore\" kind of vibe.  I have a jar full of corks I have been saving (because one never knows when one might need a used cork), and some skewers for grilled kabobs.  So, basically, this is a free craft using mostly upcycled materials.  I mean, it doesn't get more eco-friendly/sustainable than that.The only issue I had with the whole project was that we would be destroying the books.  Then, as I was making my example, it occured to me that the craft didn't have to result in a bunch of  cut up books destined for the recycling bin.  If we took care while we were making our trees, we could preserve the frame work of the book and turn it into something else that was gift-worthy.A book safe!This year the news all around warns that money will be tight for most folks and that gift giving may require more creativity and less plastic (as in credit cards).  Being able to share ways to a zero waste, FREE, and lovely holiday decoration with the bonus of a potential gift, just makes me happy. And I'm thinking that saving $150 on a wine cork lazy susan by making my own out of the corks I've been saving is an absolute win!Happy Holidays!  May your holidays be merry, bright, and frugal!"},
{"title": "Riot ", "date": "Monday, October 24, 2022", "text": "Have you seen these \"new\" climate activists?  A group of young people from Germany have decided that fossil fuels are bad (no shit!) and destroying the world (really?  that's news?), and to bring attention to these facts, they are throwing food at priceless works of art as a form of protest ... or as a way to shine light on the issue of climate change, which, I can only assume, they believe that everyone else is ignoring.  Their rational is that due to continued use of fossel fuels, the human population is doomed to extinction, and since we're all going to die, anyway, and no will be around to appreciate the art, they should just destroy it, because, you know, that's the logical and useful way to deal with the issue.My question, to them, is what are THEY doing about it?  Well, other than trying to destroy priceless and timeless works of art as a form of protest.Several years ago, I joined a group of thousands of other \"activists\" in a form of protest to bring to light the issue of climate change, and I dragged (a mostly reluctant) Deus Ex Machina and our daughters into the fray with me.  We were writers, bloggers, authors, civic-minded individuals, who saw what was happening in the world and wanted to change things before it was too late.  We didn't march on Washington wearing oddly shaped hats, or visit museums and throw soup or mashed potatoes at centuries' old paintings.  We didn't call on our leaders to pass laws and make policies that forced others to make changes, we, ourselves, had not, yet, commited to making. No, what we did was attempt to follow the sage advice of Mahatma Gandhi, who believed that true change can only come from within.  We change.  We BE THE CHANGE, we want to see in the world.  That's what he said.  That's what we did.The movement was called the Riot for Austerity, and our goal and our practice was to change our own, personal, footprint with the goal of reducing our consumption to 10% of the resources that the average \"westerner\" (mostly calculated by American standards) used.    There were seven categories we were attempting to reduce: gas/oil (for heating and cooking); transportation; water; garbage; consumer spending; food; and electrical usage.Here at Chez Brown, we cut our electrical and water usage to one-third average; our food consumption was 80% locally sourced; garbage was 5% of average; consumer spending was 40% of average.  Because we were homeschooling and I worked from home, getting our numbers any lower was difficult, and whereas other members of the community might not count their personal consumption of electricity, water, etc. at their jobs or at their children's schools, I didn't have that luxury.  At any rate, we rioters thought the best way to fix the climate issue was to make changes in OUR lives, and so we did.  We cut our own consumption.  We wrote books and blogs and magazine articles.  We went to the Mother Earth News Fairs and the Common Ground Fair, and we spread the word as far and as wide as we could.It was a different mind-set, I guess.  One of *I* can DO something, and *I* SHOULD do something.Rather than, someone else needs to fix it, but let me tell them how.The onus was on us, rather than us pointing the finger and demanding someone else do the work to make things better.I don't disagree with the intent of the protesters who are tossing potatoes at paintings.  We do need more people to be thinking about climate change and ways they can mitigate it. And really about resource scarcity and depletion, in general.I do disagree with their tactics, and I wonder what they are, personally, doing to make things better so that there is someone here far into the future to enjoy that Monet they just tried to defile.Deus Ex Machina always calls me when he's on his way home.  We chat during his drive from there to here, about the day, about whatever, and the call usually ends when I see him pull down the road or into the driveway, and I say, \"I see you.  I'm hanging up now.\" The other day it was raining during his drive home.  We were chatting, as usual.\"There's a hitchhiker,\" he told me when he was less than a half mile from home.  \"I'm going to see if he needs a ride.\"He pulled over, and I could hear him having an exchange with the, what turned out to be a couple of,  hitchhikers - a man and a woman.  They were going into town - about a two and half mile walk, which under better weather conditions wouldn't be bad, but in the cold, autumn rain, wasn't pleasant.  He offered them a ride.  I told him I was hanging up.  I knew where he was going, roughly, and about how long it would take ... if they had nefarious intentions.When he got home, he told me their story.  They were homeless and needed a ride into town to retrieve their stuff.  They lived in a tent, which they had stowed behind the drug store in town.  They were unemployed, but were looking for work.  \"It's hard to find a job when you're homeless,\" they told Deus Ex Machina.  \"When you can't shower and all,\" they added. We're nearing the end of what has been a month and half-long remodel project of my daughter's bedroom.  It's only taken us a quarter of a century to get around to fixing that room.  The closet was a hacked-together mess that looked like it had been hastily constructed using leftover materials from some other project ... or actually looked like something someone like me would have built.  I am not handy, and any building projects I have ever tried (which are very few and far between, because I *know* I am not handy) look much better in my head than in reality.   I have always wanted to tear down the closet and rebuild it, and we finally had the time, the money, and the incentive (revamping our auxillary heat system, because having a back-up in case something like what happened last year, when the glass door on the front of our woodstove cracked in November, is always good).  After we took out the closet \"walls\".  The \"BEFORE.\"In addition to the closet issues, we've known for a long time that the room was inadequately insulated and the carpet is older than the *adult* daughter who occupies the room.  So, we demo'd the room down to studs (including the stupid closet) on the outside walls and ceiling and pulled up the old carpeting.  We tripled the insulation in the ceiling and doubled what was in the walls, put up new drywall, painted, and laid a wood laminate floor.  Goodbye, carpeting!  I can't say I'll miss you!The new closet is a custom built-in cabinet installation and will be on the other side of the room, which should open up the room to allow for a better placement of a bed.It's been a lot of work.  A LOT more work than we actually wanted to do, not because we didn't want those things done, but because we are of a maturity level that we wanted to hire someone to do the work rather than do it ourselves - not that we doubted our abilities (although, as I mentioned, I am not the \"do-er\", I am the helper for most of the project).  The problem is that most handymen/contractors are very busy - still.  No one wanted a job as small as ours.We got it done, though, and in between doing the work on the room, we still went to work during the week, continued with our weekly dance and music lessons, maintained our farm/home, and found time to go apple picking and do some canning.  Some things are still on the to-do list, but mostly, we were able to do all of the things that needed doing, and also finish the room. It helped that we were placed on a very strict time-line by scheduling the heat system installation and deliveries of fixtures and furniture.  We couldn't just claim to be too busy to get it done.  And it's mostly done. Taken from the side of the room where the closet used to be toward the door.  Yes, it's a very long/narrow room.  The \"new\" closet will be to the left of the door.There's some trim that needs to be installed, still, but by the first of November, our daughter should be back in her room, and her stuff, of which there is a great deal, should be recorraled out-of-(my)sight/out-of-mind.  It will be very nice to have my house back in order.We installed the floor this weekend.  It took about four hours.  A VERY LONG four hours, to be honest.  It was a lot of bending and stooping (mostly for Deus Ex Machina, who did the bulk of the work) and standing and holding and sweeping and moving of things (for me).In a moment of weakness, I might have wished the time away and longed for that \"being done.\"  I find the measuring and cutting especially tedious, and I still don't know why we had to cut so many pieces.  \"To stagger the seams\", I was told, but the laminate already has built-in staggered seams.  I just thought, cut what we \"have\" to cut to make it fit, and just lay the rest of it, which is why *I* am not in charge of projects.  Deus Ex Machina tends to be a bit more of a perfectionist than I am.  Thankfully!There might have been a moment or two when I wished we were done, or, maybe, even regretted getting started, but then, sometime in the middle of my achiness and fatigue, I thought of that couple that Deus Ex Machina met on the road the week prior.  I am grateful to have a room that I could demolish and rebuild.  I am thankful that I don't live in a tent and have to hitchhike in the rain ... or walk two miles to find the tent I have hidden, all the while hoping that someone else hasn't found it.  In an extreme survival scenario the first priority is shelter.  I always think about that. I also think about the fact that everything is easier when one has a place to live.  It's easier to eat an affordable and healthy diet, because one has a place to store extra food and to cook food from ingredients rather than boxes.  Costly take out is a luxury we can occcasionally afford rather than how we have to eat, because there are few other choicesIt's easier to save money on clothes.  With the space to store sewing supplies, one can mend rather than having to re-purchase.  Or redye one's black shirts when they start to get faded from drying them on the \"solar clothes-dryer\", and speaking of, one can have a clothesline and a washing machine, rather than having to spend an hours' worth of our wages to to wash and dry a load of laundry.  With a place to live, life is just easier.I've read a lot of anecdotes from the (last) Great Depression, and the thing that sticks with me are the stories of people who stayed put.  Who were poor, very poor, but they had a place to live, and that made all of the difference.They had a place to live, and if they were lucky, a small yard where they could grow a few vegetables and/or raise a few chickens for eggs.  They didn't have much, but they ate.  That's more than a lot of folks could say.  And they could use what they had to make what they needed, rather than having to depend on someone else to meet their needs, which always costs more than doing it oneself.I did some touch-up painting this morning in that room.  I installed the outlet and light switch covers, and then, I sat in the middle of the empty room, singing, and enjoying the cool acoustics.And I gave thanks that I have this space, this home, this SHELTER.If I could give one piece of advice to people who ask me what they should be doing to prepare for this coming economic downturn, I would say make sure you have a place to live.  After that, life is easier."},
{"title": "I'd Like Change for My Dollar", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2022", "text": "This is a post from my original blog \"Surviving the Suburbs.\"  I was thinking about this post this morning, when my very lovely, incredibly talented, extremely capable, and highly intelligent friend sent me a text.  She said that the husband of one of her friend had asked her what she does, and she answered that she is a housewife.  His response was to leave the room and take a nap.  She asked me if I thought she was boring (!!).My friend holds a nursing degree.  She is a licensed massage therapist.  She is bilingual enough that she lived and worked in a bar in Europe in a non-English speaking country, and no one knew she wasn't a native.  She is an incredibly talented artist, and when it comes to home economics, she is a superstar.  She can do everything from sewing slipcovers for her patio furniture (altough she claims she hates to sew) to making soap (and the soap she makes is as much a work of art as it is functional).I was sad to hear how this man treated her, leaving her feeling like she was worth-less than other people, because her \"job\" was to take care of her home - like all she does is wash dishes, fold laundry, and watch soap operas all day, all of which assumes that she has nothing interesting to say.  It's frustrating and disheartening to be made to feel less-than, because one does not make money.  Unfortunately, our consumerist culture is all about \"making money\", but as I have shown, or at least tried to show, here and here and on most of the other posts on THIS blog, housewifery is more about how we \"earn\" by not earning.  My daughter stopped by this morning to borrow some camping gear, and I was telling her about my friend's worry.  My daughter works a full-time job and is raising two teenaged daughters.  I said to her, \"I don't know how you do it.\"  Her response was, \"I pay someone else to shop for me.\"  She explained that she does curbside pick-up.  She places the order, the store employees pick her groceries, she drives to the store and parks, and they bring out the bagged up groceries and put them in her trunk.  She says it saves her HOURS per week, because just the in-person grocery shopping experience would take more than an hour, and she shops more than one store.   I hadn't really considered how having someone else do the shopping could be a benefit to a working parent, although Deus Ex Machina hates all shopping and is very happy to allow me to shop for him  for everything from his clothes to his food.  \"Housewifery\" is a dying skill, thanks in a large part to the attitudes that I discuss in this post.  Feel free to leave a comment.  ==============================Most people who've read my blog for any length of time know that I'm a stay-at-home mom. Well, actually, I guess technically, I'm a work-at-home mom.A dozen years ago we called ourselves WAHMs. Lots of books were written about us, and we were considered the fastest growing industry in the country. I was even quoted in The Entrepreneurial Parent: How to Earn Your Living and Still Enjoy Your Family, Your Work, Your Life, and for a time, I had an online bookstore with a niche focus on offering information, articles and low-cost books that focused on working from home. It was one of my many home-based entrepreneurial projects. I was so determined to stay home with my children that I worked really hard to earn, at least, what I would have earned, minus expenses (like childcare, transportation, extra food, clothing etc.) if I had an outside-the-home job. For the most part, at least for the last ten years, I've had a pretty steady income working from home, but even if I didn't, I would still be here, because over the years, we've developed a certain standard of living that is only possible because I am home full-time.The problem with being home full-time, however, is that society often has a fairly negative view of us SAHMs/WAHMs. I've personally experienced the insurance industry's opinion when we applied for life insurance. I've written about it before, and we were able to find an insurance company that didn't care about my income, but was more than willing to take our monthly premiums and insure me at an amount that actually reflects our need.It's not just the insurance industry, however. Last week, our President gave a speech to a group of Rhode Island college students in which he espoused those very ideas - that legislation should be passed to allow women to be \"full and equal participants\" in the economy, i.e. that women should not be penalized for being mothers (maternity leave), that wages should be more even between the genders, and that \"quality, affordable daycare\" should be made available so that women can get out there and make money without worrying about whether their children are receiving good care. What bothers me most about the speech is that, whether intentional or not, President Obama is espousing the exact same mistaken idea that the insurance agent expressed - mothers who choose to stay home are not as valuable to our society as mothers who work.This morning I found this article, and from the first few paragraphs, I began nodding my head, and by the time I was finished, I was nearly giving myself whiplash. Yes! Yes! Yes!All of the things that the author of the article cites as being beneficial to her family, but also more. Because I'm home full-time, we were able to explore alternative lifestyles, like suburban homesteading. I was able to learn skills I would never have thought needed to be learned if I were working full-time, or even if I wanted to know those skills, I would have had less time to work at them. Soap making? Yeah, right. My being home also improves our personal economy, because we can heat with wood, which would not be possible if we were gone for ten hours a day, five days a week. We would not be hanging the laundry on the line. I would not be cooking, from scratch, five nights a week, and our daughter, who cooks, from scratch, the other two nights, would never have learned that skill. All of that aside, the problem is not really about my need to defend myself, but rather this continuing battle between those who work and those who don't. Having someone as influential as the President of the United States saying that we need more programs for working mothers (so that women can be \"full and equal participants\" in the economy) just encourages the idea that non-wage earners are less valuable.More of the same old rhetoric of \"more money will make everyone happier\" is tiresome. As a veteran stay-a-home/work-at-home Mom, I know the value of having parents be home with their children, of finding a true work/life balance, of finding meaning and value in one's life outside of the need to make more money.My being home may well be a luxury, for both me and Deus Ex Machina, but maybe, instead of wasting time trying to force legislation that makes more workers, we should be focusing on encouraging one-income families in which one parent stays home full-time (and it doesn't have to be the \"mom\". Dads can be awesome stay-at-home parents, too!). Maybe the answer isn't to put six million children in day care this year, but rather to find a way to allow six million parents to be home with their children.Here's the  video of President Obama's speech in Rhode Island. For the record, this post isn't a defense of SAHMs or a criticism of working mothers, but rather a commentary on the fact that by placing all of our emphasis on the need to work, we are stripping ourselves of our independence and choice. Independence isn't having a job, an apartment and a car, but rather the ability to meet one's own needs, and I would never have cultivated the skills necessary to be truly independent, if I had worked a full-time job and put my kids in daycare."},
{"title": "Why would a Prepper want nail polish?  Let me tell you!", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2022", "text": "I'm not usually a futzy kind of woman.  I don't go to a salon to get my hair done.  I've been cutting my own hair for most of my adult life, and I've had my hair dyed a total of once ... in my life (which spans more than a half a century).  My daughter did it.  I also don't buy a lot of fancy and expensive bath products.  In fact, as you may recall, if you've been reading here for any amount of time, I learned to make my own soap, including a soap paste for diluting to make liquid soap (thanks, Hattie!), and that is what I and Deus Ex Machina have been using for our full-body washing for the past year.  I love how versatile and easy it is, and I love even more that I can add my own essential oils to make whatever scent that suits me.  My current favorite is basil-bergamot.  Can't get that at the grocery store.  Just sayin'.  In addition, I don't wear a lot of make-up.  Eyeliner and mascara, both in basic black, and maybe a little concealer.  I haven't worn eye shadow or blush since college, and I've never liked lipstick on myself.  And nail polish has never been something on which I've spent much time or money.  I don't paint my fingernails ... not really ever.  I spent too much time working in the food service industry and the military - where painted nails weren't prohibited, but were strongly discouraged.  In my current life, I spend too much time with my hands in dirt and other activities (like cooking) that aren't conducive to keeping nails pretty.  Nail polish wouldn't last long on my fingernails.  And frankly, my preferred aesthetic, when it comes to hands, is short, neat, clean and bare fingernails.  I do, however, LOVE to paint my toenails.  I have one bottle of nail polish that I've had for as long as I can remember, because nail polish isn't something I spend a lot of time or money on. I would paint my nails, and when the polish wore off, or my toenails out grew the polished areas, I would just paint over the old polish.  So, when my daughter and daughter-in-law started inviting me to their Color Street parties on Facebook, I was completely skeptical.  Cosmetics aren't my thing, especially nail polish.  I just wasn't sure what I was going to do.  I had to watch a YouTube video to even understand what they were, and after the video, I was even more skeptical.  Like, what ... in ... the ... heck ... are those things??!!  But I put aside all of my critical throughts and anti-consumerist ideologies, and decided to trust those two very smart and very wonderful women, who know me, and know what I am like and what I like.  They wouldn't ask me to violate my principles for a 'beauty' product, if they didn't really think it had some value.  I ordered a few of the kits, and they arrived in these flat packages of little nail-shaped stickers (they aren't stickers).  They seemed a little futzy and bothersome.  I wasn't sure how to use them, and I was worried I'd make a mess of it.  I shared my concerns with my daughter, who was kind and generous enough to not only NOT laugh at my incompetence, but also came to my house and did my nails for me.  What a great kid!  I'm a lucky mom ;).  Applying the polish was easy, and YES, the Color Street product is actual nail polish - not stickers!  It goes on quickly and easily, and with a heck of a lot less mess than nail polish.  Have you ever had to clean up nail polish that your nine year old daughter spilled all over the bathroom floor and toilet (and, no, I don't know how she managed that!), and replace a towel that she used to wipe up the polish in an attempt to clean it up herself?  The Color Street appliques are clean and neat and the only \"mess\" is the packaging.  They're super easy to use, even for someone as uncoordinated as I can be.  There are special \"pedicure\" kits, which I had been purchasing.  I must have said something about wishing the there were more color/style options for  pedicures, and my stylist informed me that the manicure kits can be used on one's toes, as well.    Wha-a-a-a-t??I must have mentioned something about Color Street nails to my co-worker, because the other day,  she brought a gift for me.  It was a box FULL of Color Street nail kits!  She said that she wasn't going to use them, and she thought I might like them.  I was and am completely overwhelmed by her generosity and thoughtfulness!The Prepper me looked at all of those nail kits and thought, \"Huzzah! I'm ready for the end of the world as we know it!\"I recently read Susan Beth Pfeffer's novel The Dead and the Gone.  The novel follows teenager, Alex Morales, who lives in New York City.  When an asteroid crashes into the moon, the whole world goes wonky, and Alex has to figure out how to survive with his two younger sisters.  One thing I always hate about TEOTWAWKI novels is the propensity of writers to follow the same trope of the world descending immediately into complete chaos, anarchy, and violence.  The problem I have is that the trope is not true to the real way most people behave following disasters.  Yes, there is occasionally looting, rioting, and violence, but most of the time, what I've seen is people being generous and helpful to other people.  And I like to think that if we do suffer an End of the World As We Know It event, what we will find is more in keeping with how people actually react following extreme weather events or during war time.In Pfeffer's novel, there are shortages, because supply lines have been completely severed.  NYC has always been considered a food desert, but now it might as well be an island in the middle of the ocean ... and they don't have any boats. Alex is fortunate to find a store where he can barter for food, and Alex discovers that the proprieator is willing to accept personal care items in exchange for canned goods.  Alex can get some green beans and Campbell's chicken noodle soup for bars of soap.That story element is actually steeped in fact.  Sometimes that little bit of soap or lipstick is as valuable as food to a starving population.  It's true. During World War II, when there were shortages and rationing, cosmetic companies propagandized wearing make-up.  According to this article, \"maintaining a sense of glamour in day-to-day life was a way to retain dignity, bravery, and ... a little bit of fun.\"  Likewise, stories from the Siege of Sarajevo reveal that there were people who are willing to sell loaves of bread or cans of soup for a bit of soap or some lipstick.  Wearing a bit of lipstick (or nail polish) is an opportunity to feel a little less like one is \"just surviving\", and a little more like one is living.  It gives us back our humanity.I have always used this list as my guideline for what I should be considering important in my stocking up.  At the end of the list of 100 items to stock is a list of eight recommendations from a survivor of the Sarajevo War/siege.  Number 7 made me rethink the notion that beauty care items are unnecessary and frivilous.  And it's the reason I was overwhelmed and incredibly appreciative for the gift of pretty nails from my friend.  When I saw that huge bag of nail strips, my thought was what an amazing gift my friend had given me.  To her, it might just be nail polish.  To me, it was a chance to feel a little prettier, and in a worstcase world, a little more human.In the larger scheme of things, there's not much point in survival, if we lose our humanity, and it may seem a little silly, maybe even narcissistic, to place value on something as frivilous as painted nails, but in the end, for good or for bad, there will be someone who will be willing to trade a thing of value for some glamour."},
{"title": "Where Did the Time Go?", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2022", "text": "I hadn't thought much about the fact that I haven't blogged most of this year, until I received a notfication of a comment from Nancy, basically, asking if things were okay up here in the northeast.  Yes, but clearly, I've been neglecting a part of my life that is important to me.  I don't really have a reason that I haven't been blogging, except that, I guess I've felt a little full with other things and projects.   What's been happening since February?Lots of great family stuff:Prodigal daughter returning from her internship on the other side of the equator.  The \"baby\" taking a job as a co-worker (of sorts) with her dad. Then, taking a second job.  Then, deciding which of these two FULL-TIME jobs she wanted to keep, because working 80 hours a week is a lot for a teenager.  It's been a really enlightening six months for her.Visits from out-of-state family.Deus Ex Machina spending every weekend since May hiking and/or kayaking, which has been amazing!Attending some fun faires, festivals, and live shows (which we haven't done since 2019), and in general, very much enjoying the fact that we live in Maine, a.k.a. \"Vacationland.\"Making more time for old friends.  Lots of great homestead stuff:Planting, tending, and harvesting the garden.Doing some pickling/preserving (mostly eggs and jalepenos)Still making soap.Raising our annual allotment of meat birds.Breeding our rabbits.We are planning some home-renovations and improvements.  The original plan was hire someone to do the work, but it looks like we're going to have to do-it-ourselves.  Luckily, we have a lot of kids, and they are agreeing to help us out, which is amazing!  I am a lucky mama!And working!  If you recall, I started working at the library last October.  I love my gig as a library assistant.  It's a dream job, and I'm very much enjoying both the work and the people.  I feel very fortunate to have the job, because it is very deeply and personally satisfying work.  As I have said, many times over the years, the library is the BEST resource/service a community can provide for its residents.  It is the ONE place that has something for every one!  And I am very blessed to be a part of it.I am also still serving the homeschool community as a resource teacher, and the summers are typically really busy with doing portfolio reviews.  So, that's taken most of my free time. And I am working on a novel.  I have half-a-dozen novels I've attempted over the years in various stages of completion, but I have always gotten stuck and not been able to finish them.  This time is a little different, because I started it differently, and so I'm hoping it will be the one that ultimately sees the bookstore shelves.  It is, of course, a post-apocalyptic story.  I mean, what else would one expect from me?  So, thank you to Nancy, who reached out.  I apologize for appearing to drop off the grid.  I am still around and healthy and happy!  Things are pretty much \"normal\" - whatever that means.  Hopefully, I'll be able to post a little more regularly, starting probably in September, when the portfolio review season has ended.Until next time, be well.  Stay cool ... and hydrated!"},
{"title": "Why We Prep", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2022", "text": "I realized, today, that I've been prepping and writing about prepping for a decade and a half.  This year marks eleven years since my first book (on prepping) was published and next year will be a decade since the book Deus Ex Machina and I co-authored was published.  I'm probably not the best prepper there is, though.  I don't have a bunker in my back yard.  I know.  You're shocked.I also don't have a bug-out \"camp\" tucked up in the unincorporated areas near Baxter State Park that's already stocked and just waiting for TEOTWAWKI so that we can begin living the life we really want to live.  I'm sorry to disappoint.My mantra has always been, \"Do what you can with what you have where you are.\"  And I have always planned to stay in my suburban home.  I know there are preppers out there who are shaking their heads, thinking I'm silly, or worse ... doomed.The thing is, that EVENT that we've all been preparing for is happening, right now.  The last two years have seen serious natural disasters (and I'm not even including the virus), world wide financial devastation and hardship, increasing prices on everything from fuel to socks, and massive shortages on all manner of products from toilet paper to housing - at least here in the northeast, where even finding a place to rent is a challenge.  This  article, published just last week, details some of the current shortages people are likely to see at their local supermarket.My goal, with prepping, has never been to have every thing I need forever stored in my house, and used on a rotational basis with lots of really keen calendars, bookkeeping, and spreadsheets with \"best if used by\" dates.  I'm just not that organized, frankly.My friend, Larry Kollar, commented on my book review post.  He mentioned the really big issue with storing water, and that is, will it be good when we need it?  And he is correct.  How many of us, preppers, started buying up canned goods and supplies and storing those things in the extra bedroom, only to discover that many of those canned goods are now beyond their \"use by\" date?  Or worse, checked the water storage to find that the plastic jugs of water are now leaking, because those plastic containers actually do break down over time.  If we're not constantly using and resupplying those things, then, we've wasted our money. And at this moment, right now, as I'm typing this, and thinking back over the last decade, I am incredibly thankful that I never invested in a 50lb bucket of wheat berries, because eight years ago, Deus Ex Machina was advised to eliminate gluten from his diet, and so we wouldn't be able to use them anyway, but also, would I have used them?  My emergency storage food?  Since there has been no, real, emergency, in which it was eat wheat berries or die?  At best all of those wheat berries would have become chicken feed - not a bad thing, but then, if/when TSHTF we'd still be in the same situation we were in before buying a 50lb bucket of emergency rations - with no food.I also don't have 50 gallons of water stored in the basement, nor do I have a well ... or a basement. Fact is, I only have about a day's worth of stored water - in glass canning jars (which I can when I need to add extra jars to my canner because I'm canning a small batch of something).  It's not much, but I'm not worried. And I'm also not naive.  I have been accused of such in the past, but the reality is that I do have something a lot more valuable than 50 gallons of water stored in leaky plastic jugs.  I have the materials and the knowledge to make undrinkable water safe to drink.For me, that's the point and primary reason to prep, at all.  It's not to have everything we'll ever need or want stored up, but rather to have enough of a back-up of whatever we need so that we have TIME.  My small supply of stored water gives us the time to collect unpotable water and make it safe - before we are in a severe state of dehydration. I linked to an article above that lists 9 things that are in short supply at the grocery store right now.  The implication is that we can't find those things, and the reality is that when we do, they will be a lot more expensive.  A recent article at the Organic Prepper cautions that we will, likely, experience some \"sticker shock\" in the next few months, due to a ban on fertilizer exports from Russia to the US, which will increase the cost of growing our nation's produce, which will increase the price of just about all food items.That's the second reason I prep, because I don't like getting to the cash register with $200 only to find that my bill is more than the cash in my hand.  That's not only mortifying, but it also means that I will have to make some quick, and likely, inefficient decisions.  Having to make hasty decisions is usually not a good idea.When the pandemic started two years ago, we started making some changes in the way we do things here.  Most notably, I started shopping differently.  Specifically, I started ordering from online companies, and I started ordering in bulk.  I tried a bunch of different services, and finally, settled on three.We get a weekly delivery from Misfits Market**.  In its early stages, Misfits only sourced and delivered produce, and their customers didn't really have a lot of choice on what they received.  Misfits has completely transformed their business model, and now also sources other groceries, including pantry items like gluten-free bread.  They don't have the variety that the grocery store offers, but they do have most of the products that we use.What Misfits doesn't have, I have been able to find (mostly) on Boxed.com, which is a bulk ordering service - like Costco without the membership fee, or the need to visit the store and wheel around a cartload of heavy groceries.All of our pet food purchases are now through Chewy.com.Two things have happened since I started limiting my grocery store visits for things that I just absoluely can not find at either of those three places (i.e. local dairy and local meat, which I still buy at the closest little Mom&Pop grocery store).The first is that we have saved an embarrassingly large amount of money.  It's embarrassing to note how much I was spending, and to realize that a much too large portion of our weekly grocery bill was my inability to resist those impulse buys.  We eat just as well, probably better, than we did back in those days when I was shopping in person, and our grocery bill is two-thirds of what it used to be.Let that sink in for a second.In actual dollars, while the rest of the world is watching their grocery bills sky rocket, I have actually spent less, because I changed how and where I bought groceries - but not really what we buy.  We're still buying, mostly, the same things.  Yeah.  It is weird.The second is that there is no sticker shock.  Aside from the amazing conveniece of shopping with my fingers while I'm wearing \"not pants\" (a.k.a. pajamas) and drinking a cup of coffee, I can see my total AS I'm shopping, which means that those impulse items that rachet my bill higher than it should be, can be taken right out of that cart before I reach the check out.  I can also increase/decrease quantities, or do a little price comparison, before I buy, without having to drive to Hannaford and drive to Shaw's and drive to wherever.  Without having to spend hours scanning sales flyers.It's as easy as open website A, open website B, and search for item.  For instance, both Boxed.com and Misfits carry a particular brand of organic sugar.  I can compare the prices at both places, and order from the place with the lowest price.Interestingly, a side benefit of ordering online is that our gasoline bill has also gone down, because I'm not driving the 12 miles round trip to go weekly grocery shopping, which saves about $6/month.  Not a lot, but it's something.   Thing is, after spending so many years in the prepper community, writing, reading, talking with other preppers, one begins to develop a different mindset, which has also been incredibly beneficial during these times.  For instance, when gas prices started increasing last fall, Deus Ex Machina started driving our more gas efficient car to work.  It's that idea that we need to start making a change, and that willingness to do what needs to be done.  Deus Ex Machina has a longer commute to get to work, and while he would certainly rather drive his beautiful truck with all of its bells and whistles, and I prefer my little sporty coupe, the truck gets half the gas mileage of the car.  Even with the gas prices having almost doubled over the last several months, we have actually saved about $100/month with just that one, very simple change.  It also didn't hurt last fall that we  live close enough that I can walk to work, and so I wasn't using any gas at all :). My prepping isn't motivated by some innane idea that I can store up everything and thereby continue living the way we are living when things go south.  I prep, because in doing so, I give myself and my family, time to adjust to the \"new normal\" with things that are familiar to us so that when we are no longer able to find those things, it won't be so sudden.  It will be gradual, comfortable, like slipping into a pair of warm socks.====================================**This link is a referral code.  If you follow the link and sign up with Misfits Market using my link, I will get a discount on my next purchase ... and I would be REALLY grateful!"},

{"title": "How to Not Die When the Taps Go Dry - Or What They Did Wrong and How You Could Do Better", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2022", "text": "Not sure if I mentioned it, or not, but I was hired as a part-time libary assistant back in October 2021, and I've spent the last few months in what has turned out to be my actual dream job (second only to blogging, which has, thus far, been an unpaid gig).    One of the coolest things about working at a library is the ever-present opportunity to explore books.  A few weeks ago, I was straightening books in the Young Adult section, and I found a book that looked interesting.  The title is Dry.  It's co-written by the father-son duo Neal and Jarrod Shusterman and depicts a water emergency in southern California.  Southern California imports 67% of its water, much of it from the Colorado River Aqueduct.  In the story, Nevada and Arizona, concerned about their own water resources, cut off the water to Southern California.  With two-thirds of their water supply cut off, the government in Southern California shuts off the taps and reroutes all available water to emergency use only.  So, places like hospitals and prisons still have water, but the average household is dry.  The thing is, what they describe, is not outside of the realm of possibility.  Everyone who lives in Southern California knows that their water is an incredibly precious and LIMITED resource.A few years ago, I stumbled on an article about a southern California town that had already run out of water, and when I was reading that book, I kept thinking about that article.  When I started looking for articles about that town - thinking I would find something that was a few years old - I had so many hits for \"California town without water,\" that I just grabbed the most recent ones.  This article entitlted, \"An entire California town is without water - In a heat wave\" is dated June 28, 2021 - less than a year ago.  The California town is small - about 700 people - which doesn't make it better. In the above mentioned book, the water runs out in Los Angeles, which would be a lot worse and affect a significantly larger population - like that of Cape Town in South Africa.  In 2018, they ran out of water, and MILLIONS of people were affected.  Of course, Cape Town had a significant heads up.  They've known since the 1990s that running out of water was a likelihood - not just a possibility, but YES, it's going to happen.  And so they took measures ... kind of like what's happening right now in southern California, where there is a years long (maybe decades long) drought STILL.  I've always said I wouldn't live in a drought-prone area, where the likelihood of running out of water looms like a turkey vulture over the carcass of a roadkill squirrel.  But, lest we get too comfortable and, dare I say, apathetic.  It can happen here, too.  In the novel, Dry, the taps just shut off.  There is no advance warning (except, of course, the YEARS of water restrictions, etc.).  But in the book, one day there's water flowing from the taps, and the next day ... not.  And then, the whole place goes bezerk.  There were a lot of things that tweaked me about the novel, the first and foremost being, if one has CHOSEN to live in a drought prone area where the likelihood of water shortages is very high, why would one not have a stockpile of water - always?  Doesn't FEMA tell us to have a three day supply of X, Y, and Z always on hand?  It doesn't have to be a big stockpile, but enough for three days, at least, which is one gallon of water per person per day - so for a family of four, there should be a stockpile of 12 gallons of water somewhere in the house.  In the book, the water shortage lasted for a week.  One can live without water for three days.  If everyone had had a three-day supply of water (the recommended on gallon per person per day), and then, rationed that water to the minimum to survive (which is 32 ounces in a temperate climate if the person is not doing any strenuous activity), one could stretch one's water supply to almost two weeks without risking death.  One gallon of water could last one person four days with really strict rationing.  If every family in the book had had 12 gallons of water stockpiled, there wouldn't have been a story.  Just sayin'. What bothers me is that authors depicted most of the characters as being wholly and completely unprepared to live a few days without water from the tap, especially considering that the authors are FROM southern California.  And my question is: really?  Is the average person living in So. Cal. so arrogant and entitled with such an egregious lack of self-preservation that they don't have ANY water on hand?  Or anything else to drink in their house?  Certainly, water is the best, but soda, juice, or even milk would keep one from dying from dehydration.  I don't know anyone from California, but what they described would be pretty much akin to living in Maine without a heat source.  There are plenty of examples of people dying, in their homes, when the heat goes out - mostly from not being prepared to not have their usual heat source.  When the characters in the book (who live in a drought prone area) lose their single water source, they don't have a back-up.  That's foolhardy.Not having an emergency supply of water was the biggest and worst mistake that the characters made, but it wasn't the only.  As I was reading the story, I identified half a dozen different things that one or more of the characters did wrong from a survival standpoint, and here I will offer suggestions of things they could have done that would have made things a lot easier for them.1.  Shopping for the Wrong StuffThe story opens with the taps running dry.  Obviously, this is a regular occurence, as the characters don't really get worried until they are several hours into the drought before they think, \"Hey, maybe I should head over to the Costco and buy some bottled water.\" Problem is, that by the time they decide to make a run to the store, everyone else has thought the same thing, and the store is a madhouse.  I'm not sure what they expected.  Or maybe everyone just doesn't think like me.  If everyone is running toward something, I tend to move in the opposite direction, because whatever's happening over there is probably not good.  That said, since they were woefully unprepared, there was little they could do, and they really did need to go and get some supplies.  Problem is that they didn't think beyond what they believed they needed.  The main character runs into the store and heads straight to the bottled water aisle - where everyone else is.  **See above.  If everyone is heading in that direction, find a new path.In a stroke of genius, she grabs bagged ice instead.  At that point, I had high hopes for the characters' survival potential, but it wouldn't last long.  Because some guy at the store, quickly realizing what a great idea she has with the ice, tries to steal her cart (but don't get me started on ranting about how quickly things always degenerate in these books.  They aren't even half a day into this emergency and all hell is already breaking lose, which seems unrealistic from what I've seen in real-life emergency situations).The ice was a good idea, but there are about half a dozen other things she could have bought that not. one. single. water-crazed person would have taken a second glance at.  When I mentioned the issue to my daughter asking her what else they could have purchased, her immediate response was \"Watermelon.\"  Yes!  There are dozens of different foods that are rich in water content, and if the characters had taken just a few minutes to think about what they like to eat when they are really hot (and thirsty), they probably would have headed straight to the produce aisle.  Watermelon, cucumbers, tomatoes, peaches, apples, pineapple, coconut - all good food sources for helping to keep one hydrated.  This article lists nineteen water-rich foods, several of which were a surprise.  I don't, personally, like diary when I'm really thirsty, but according to the article yogurt and skim milk are good options, and I guess they would be better than dying from lack of water.  There are other aisles in the store where they could have found very useful liquids.  The baking aisle has coconut milk and canned condensed milk.  They could have headed to the canned food aisle.  Broths (also mentioned in the above linked article) and canned fruit (preferably in a light syrup) could also be useful.  The baby aisle has pedialyte.  Even the alcohol aisle has some good choices.  While we should probably stay away from the alcohol, which is dehydrating, some drink mixers and the club soda would have been useful.    Water is the best choice, of course, but in this sort of scenario, even sugary sodas would be a better option than nothing at all - which is how the story plays out.2.  Shopping at the Wrong StoreSo, they went to the Costco and bought ice, and then, went home.  That was it.  They went home, and they stayed home, and they didn't look anywhere else to purchase supplies.  I like to play a little thought exercise, where I put myself into the story, and I imagine where I could go to get those supplies that doesn't involve the grocery store.  Wait.  Who am I kidding?  I do this in real-life, too.  I don't really enjoy shopping, in general, and I really hate when I just need one or two quick things, but I have to walk through the entire 47,000 sq ft store just to get some half-and-half for my coffee.  Just for reference, an acre is 40,000 sq ft and is the amount of land one man and a mule can plow in a day - just some food for thought, the next time you're in the grocery store.  If I'm at the grocery store, not only am I at risk for purchasing half a dozen other things I don't REALLY need, but it also takes a lot longer to get those one or two little things than it needs to, because it's such a long walk.So, I've thought about other places I can go to get those small things.  Water when the taps go dry isn't a \"small\" thing, BUT the chances are that most people are going to head to Hannaford or Sam's Club for water, rather than go to those smaller stores I would head to if all I need is half-and-half. Case in point:  when the shelves at the big Hannaford store down the road were emptied of anything in a can, I visited my local Mom&Pop store.  They had plenty of everything, albeit fewer brand choices.  So, I can get tomato sauce, but maybe not the \"organic\" brand of strained tomatoes I might usually purchase.   Of course, that Mom&Pop is getting more popular these days, and during the summer, it's the main store for the tourists who invade my town, but there are still other choices that would be less populated, at least at the very beginning of the emergency.Within a six mile radius of my house, there are five boutique grocery stores, two fish markets, two Mom&Pop stores, two dollar stores, and more convenience stores than I can even remember right now.  In fact, in less than those six miles, I could drive a loop and hit the Mom&Pop, a Walgreens, the Family Dollar and the Dollar General (which are right across from each other - don't know who thought that was a good use of land space), and seven convenience stores.  And I could stop for coffee and pick-up a pizza on the way back to my house. If I ran into each establishment, and bought just a gallon of water, it would take less than an hour, and I would have eleven gallons of water - just about enough to do my family for three days, without rationing, and without having to fight other shoppers.And I would have coffee and pizza.  When the characters went to Costco, and it was a bust (except the ice), and then, they didn't even try to find water any place else, I was more than a little disappointed.  3.  Improperly Storing the SuppliesWhen the main character gets to the Costco and discovers that there are no beverages at all in any aisle, the ice idea was pure genius.  I have to give it to the authors for coming up with that idea.  Kudos!  Because I don't think I would have thought of that.  In my above loop, at all of those small groceries and convenience stores, I could also grab a bag of ice and be home before the ice melted.  Unfortunately, the genius of that particular character began and ended with that one stroke, because next thing we know, she's home with her many bags of ice, and instead of putting that ice - that is going to be their sole water supply for no one knows how long - in a secure, clean vessel where it won't get contaminated, they decide to empty the bags into the bathtub.  Okay, I will give them a bit of a break, because it was hot and the ice was melting, but seriously?  They took the time to clean the tub and seal up the drain so it wouldn't leak (thanks to advice and supplies from their prepper neighbors - more on those guys in a minute).  I guess, living in a house with dogs and cats that like to get into the tub, I would think twice about storing the water I intended to drink in my tub.  Instead, I would look for containers where I could store the water more safely.  The fact is that they do have a dog, and while the dog does not contaiminate the water, it does get contaminated, and then, they are back to square one with trying to find water to drink. So, instead of the tub, they could have found a better place to store the water.  In the kitchen, there are probably dozens and dozens of storage options.  I, personally, have canning jars, storage containers, bowls with lids, and pots and pans galore.  And water bottles!  Most of which have a neck opening big enough to fit ice cubes.  Nearly everyone in suburbia has a cooler, and for those who don't, there were probably lots of coolers at the Costco that they could have purchased.  I have two.  Deus Ex Machina and I both have a camelback for hiking.   My guess is that the average household has a lot of storage capacity and some place much safer to store their emergency water supply than their bathtub.4.  Believing in the Deus Ex Machina (and here, I do not mean my \"Deus Ex Machina - I mean the dramatic God in the Machine that will come down and save them all)There's a very common narrative, these days, maybe all days, that someone else needs to be responsible for making our lives better.  The government should take care of us.  They should give us a free education.  They should pay our medical bills (FREE health care for ALL!! is an inalienable right, or so I hear).  They should pay our car payment, and mortgage, and phone bill when we lose our jobs.  They should give us free food, and heat, and clothes, and in general, keep us safe and take care of us, like a benevolent parent.  The problem is that the government can often be pinpointed as the one who caused the problem, or, at very least, the government's unwillingness to take appropriate action caused the issue.True story: In the late 1970s a group of scientists, economists, and government officials had a conference, during which they discussed climate change.  That is, in the 1970s, BEFORE what is happening today with these super storms, massive wildfires, and decades of drought, these people knew what was going to happen, because they had data that predicted it, and before any of it started, they had the opportunity to come up with a plan to mitigate the worst of what we are currently seeing.  Maybe they couldn't completely reverse the trend, but they could have done something and chose to do nothing, because doing something, back then, would have put the world into economic turmoil.  They figured they had 50 years before they had to worry about it.  My lifetime, and here we are.  Nothing was done.  And here we are.So, the idea that the government, or anyone else, will come along and make it better, and waiting for that to happen, is foolhardy.  Many of the characters ultimately adopt a self-help attitude, realizing that they are kind of on their own, but initially, they sit around waiting for help, which ends up being a fatal action for too many.  When my power goes out, I don't sit around waiting for someone to come to my house and fix anything.  I go about my day, much as I do when I have electricity - with some modifications.  We use candles, oil lamps, or our solar lanterns instead of the overhead lights.  We're more careful when we open the fridge and freezer to keep things inside cold.  We cook on the woodstove rather than relying on the electric stove and cooktop.If I sat around waiting for help, firstly, I would be very disappointed, and secondly, I would get hungry and cold.  Worstcase, waiting around for someone to help could mean that I wait too long to help myself, which ends up being the case for some of the characters in the story.=========The story was written as if the characters seemed sure that they were making wise decisions, but the lack of common sense was bothersome.  Still, I might give a pass to the average suburbanite for being oblivious.  There is a general concensus that those of us in the suburbs are kind of entitled and self-centric, believing that someone will fix it for us, but there was one family in the novel who were preppers, and some of the biggest mistakes in the story were made by that family.  I'm not sure if the authors were poking fun at preppers in general, or just making their own brand of preppers seem a little Abbott and Costello, but they weren't painted in a very positive light.  They were described, from the beginning, as being \"weird\" or \"odd.\"  The problem is that the preppers were not very prepared for what was actually going to happen, which is silly, since they live in southern California, and having no water SHOULD be THE thing they are preparing for (like here in Maine, THE thing I prepare for is losing electricity during a winter storm).  They thought they were prepared, because they had all of these supplies, and water, and a solar array for back-up power, and even a bug-out location, but the fact is that they had isolated themselves so completely from the rest of the community that everyone knew they were up to something, and when it came down to it, the prepper family ended up being a target rather than a member of the community.And it didn't have to be that way.It could have ended so much differently for them.  While all of the characters made some really stupid decisions, in my opinion, the ones who should have been most prepared made the worst of them.  The next few items are things everyone should avoid, but are definitely mistakes the prepper family made. 5.  Isolating Oneself from One's NeighborsMost of us are never going to go through the full-societal breakdown described in the book Dry.  It could happen, but it's not likely.  If it did, though, I fully expect that my neighbors and I would be collaborating.  I don't know what, if anything, my neighbors might have that could help me in a worstcase scenario, and I don't know what they believe I might have, but by sharing our resources, it's possible that all of us could survive.A few years ago, we had a massive ice storm that knocked out power to most of Maine.  There were communities that didn't get their power restored for weeks.  Here at Chez Brown, we had a propane water heater with a pilot light, which means we still had hot water.  We also have a woodstove.  So, we could take hot showers.  Our house was warm, and we could heat water for coffee and tea and cook dinner on the woodstove. I let my neighbors know that we had these resources.  I let them know they could come over and take a hot shower (in a dark bathroom, but still a hot shower).  I let them know we had hot coffee and tea, and I even opened a standing dinner invitation.  I let my local family members know.  My friend stopped by for a few hours with her kids on one of the days, and we baked bread on the woodstove in my Dutch oven and our kids played together.  It's possible that she might have, eventually, felt entitled to what I had, but it's very unlikely that she would have tried to take my home, with the woodstove, by force.  Worstcase might have been that she would have tried to move in with us, but that's unlikely, too.  More likely, things would shift, and a few weeks into the emergency, there would be an opportunity for her to purchase her own woodstove, or a generator to run her own heating system.  If the preppers had allowed themselves to share, even just a little more than they did, they might not have ended up in as tragic a situation as they did. 7.  Broadcasting Your PrepsLike many prepper novels, the emergency has a cascading effect.  It's like those old-timey strings of Christmas lights.  One light goes out, they all go out!  First one system goes down, and then, they all go down.   In this novel, first the water stops, and then the electricity goes out.  The prepper family, who has water and food and a solar array, are sitting in their comfortable, air conditioned home with the lights blazing, watching some very loud television show, when the rest of the neighborhood goes dark, and quiet.  It's like being the only house in the neighborhood with a noisy generator during a massive power outage.  Lights blazing in a blackout is a sure way to draw attention to the fact that you're different, and maybe there's something inside that fortress that everyone else might want ... need?If we're trying to keep a low profile as preppers, then, being as similar to the other houses in the neighborhood as possible would be prudent, unless they are always using their solar array, and everyone in the neighborhood KNOWS that they have the solar array.  In which case, like I did with my friends and neighbors by extending an invitation into my warm, wood-heated home during the power outage, they should have been prepared to at least, invite the neighbors inside to enjoy the cool air.  No water AND sweating it out is a really bad formula for creating desparation.  If the neighbors could have gotten a reprieve from the heat, maybe they would have been less quick to mob the house for the water they assumed was inside. I was appalled when the prepper family was sitting in their air-conditioned living room watching television, oblivious to the fact that no one else had lights.  As a literary device it could be considered foreshadowing, if it hadn't been so smack-you-in-the-face obvious that the prepper family was already a target.And as paranoid as they were depicted before the SHTF, one would think they would have known better than to broadcast.7.  Focusing on Supplies Instead of Skills.My prepper question  \"... and then what?\"  Deus Ex Machina's old friend from high school is a curriculum coordinator for our local Adult Ed program, and she contacted him a while back about the possibility of having us propose a class.  He and I started discussing what we might teach, and the one that stuck was a preparedness/survival course, similar to one I taught for our homeschooling co-op.  One of the class days would focus on securing drinkable water.  In the class I did with my homeschoolers, we built a simple water filter.  For this class, I wanted to do something different, especially after reading this book, and so Deus Ex Machina and I started talking about ways to make water or ways to make undrinkable water safe to drink.  By undrinkable, I'm not talking about pond water.  As hikers, we have several Life Straws and other hiking-centric filter options.  For here at home, I'd have a Berkey filter, which would do the job just as well as any filter I could build.But what one can not do is filter saltwater and make it drinkable. In the novel, a couple of days into the water emergency, word gets out that the local authorities have set-up water desalination equipment on the beach.  The result is predictable.  Tens of thousands of people head down to the beach to get water.  Only sucking water straight from the ocean and desalinating it is not how the machines were designed to work.  The water should have been filtered.  Seaweed clogs the machines.  Thirsty people get angry when they can't get water.  Blah.  Blah.  Violence. What bothered me is that there is SO MUCH information available on very simple ways that the average Joe can distill water.  This article describes a couple of ways to get water that are super simple.  It won't give much water, but enough so that one won't die.  To be fair, the prepper does show his neighbor how to get water from the drought-hardy plants the neighbor has replaced his lawn with, but that's the extent of his knowledge on how to procure water, which was very disappointing, to me.  As someone who lives in a drought-prone area, I would think that he would know how to get water for a variety of sources, including making a solar still (as described in the link above).  Like the characters in this novel, I live in a seaside community, and so while there are a lot of options for getting fresh water, what I wanted to teach my class was how to distill water from saltwater.  I mean, the reality is that I've wanted to learn to play with making a home distiller, anyway, and being able to make a saltwater distiller would be a great way to experiment with it.I posed the question to Deus Ex Machina, my engineer, and as aways, he came through. Using a regular sauce pan with a tight-fitting lid with a stream vavle on top and three metal straws, we made fresh drinkable water from saltwater.  It was only a couple of sips each, but it worked!  Using only materials that we had around the house, we were able to make a distiller.  This video has the same idea.  Using just two glass bottles and sand, the videographer distills water. Of course, my ultimate dream would be to make a distiller using my pressure cooker.  This video illustrates one way to turn a pressure cooker into a still. My goal would not be to turn my pressure canner/cooker into a still, but rather to USE my pressure canner/cooker as a still, and the only thing I need to make it happen is copper tubing.  We measured the size of the steam valve on my pressure canner/cooker and with a very cursory search found 10' of 1/2\" copper tubing at my local Ace Hardware.  Which also happens to be within that 4 mile radius loop of stores I could visit to get water (that I mention above). As a prepper, the best thing I can do is learn to DO stuff with what I have, or stock the supplies that help me make what I need.  So, yes, store some water, but ALSO have the tools one needs to make whatever water supply is available into drinkable water, and have the skills to make it happen.As a note: Amazon sells a water distiller for around $120.  I'm disappointed that the preppers in the story, who were of the \"buy shit\" variety of preppers, didn't have a water distiller from Amazon.com. ========The novel Dry is a well written, engaging piece of young adult fiction, and I did enjoy reading it.  I also recommend others read it, as entertainment (for those who like doomer fiction), but also as a really good 'how-NOT-to' guide for getting through an emergency.  That is how NOT to die in a worstcase scenario, and we can start by having, at least, the minimum recommended emergency stash. Have you read Dry?  What did you think?"},
{"title": "Making Stuff, Or Why I Will Never Be a Marie Kondo Convert ", "date": "Wednesday, December 8, 2021", "text": "Precious and I headed out to the store the other day.  I had a very short list of things for which I was searching.  Among the items was a storage basket for Deus Ex Machina.  He has been working on this project, and he's in the production phase, which means he has a bunch of materials for making this product he has engineered.  Unfortunately, the way that he was storing said items was ... well, kind of messy, and kind of in the way, especially if we intend to put up a Holiday tree, which I do ... intend to do.My plan was to get a basket to stash his stuff, which could, then, be stored under the bench at our dining room table (where he is doing most of his work anyway).  I've probably mentioned it before, but we don't have a lot of storage space in my house.  We don't have very many closets, cabinets, drawers, or nooks.  So, I use baskets, a lot.  Not only are baskets wonderful for taming miscellaneous clutter, but they're also kind of cute and fit with my overall \"functional homestead\" decor.    So, we headed over to the Christmas Tree Shop, which is right next door to Michael's.  I figured one or the other place would have what I was looking for.The Christmas Tree Shop, sort of, had what I was looking for.  They didn't have any baskets, but they did have cloth storage boxes - 2 for $9.99.  It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but with no other good choices, I grabbed the package of two and headed for the cash register,But, then, we saw the LINE!  There were two registers open with a line that wended its way in a zigzag  through the store, 30 FULL carts deep in BOTH lines.Have I mentioned that I hate waiting?  Precious, who usually likes to shop, took one look at that line and channeled me.\"That's a long line,\" she says.\"Yep,\" I replied.We decided that nothing we were holding was worth that wait, put our stuff back, and headed next door to Michael's.We walked through the doors and were immediately struck by the empty shelves.  It was surreal.  The last time I saw shelves that empty was the toilet paper aisle at Hannaford from March to June 2020.  Undaunted, we continued on our mission to find a storage container and headed more deeply into the store.  After the third lap around the store, I had to admit that there were no baskets.  Wait. What?  There were no baskets?  Michael's always has baskets and boxes, and cute little storage containers.  Always.  I was shocked and disappointed.    And we left, empty-handed ... again.After that, we were done and headed back home, defeated.But I think, if I had bought something that I didn't really want, I would have been more disappointed in having spent the money.The truth is that times like these are good for me, because they remind me that I, usually, have the skill, knowledge, and ability to make my own whatever it is that I'm looking to buy.  Baskets are no exception.In fact, a few weeks ago, Deus Ex Machina and I spent a lovely Saturday morning at a basket-weaving workshop where we learned to make baskets out of Bittersweet, which is an invasive vine here in southern Maine.  What's funny is that Deus Ex Machina and I started making baskets out of barn rope many years ago using the same technique that we learned in the workshop.  I know how to make baskets.And because I'm not a Marie Kondo convert, but rather a very skilled prepper, I often have the supplies on hand to make exactly what I need - or, as we were reminded in the workshop, I can usually find what I need, in this case, by going out in my yard and cutting back some invasive Bittersweet vine.For Deus Ex Machina's storage basket or box, I wanted something square or rectangular rather than circular.  So, the basket weaving wasn't my first choice. After I couldn't buy what I wanted, my plan was to repurpose a cardboard box into a storage  container that didn't look like a cardboard box. When Precious and I returned home from our failed shopping trip the other day, I found the perfect box.  My plan was to cover it with fabric.  Then, I remembered that we had some twine rope.  I don't even recall where we got it, or when.  I'm pretty sure that it's been stored under a bed or on a shelf for the half of this century.  I found it, today, stashed in our under-the-bed drawers.  We also have a hot glue gun, because while I'm not terribly crafty, we did homeschool, which means I have a lot of craft supplies and tools.  And so, using what I had on hand, I made a storage container.  It's lined with one of Deus Ex Machina's holey polo shirts, because I often keep old clothes, too, which eventually become something else - like rag rugs, or quilts, ... or the lining of a box-turned-basket.  Including the cost of the glue sticks for my hot glue gun, my homemade basket only cost $2.  This similar basket at IKEA is $12.99.  By making my own, I saved $10.99. And the hour I saved by not standing in a very long line to purchase something that would only sort of do what I needed, I spent being creative, and I probably saved a lot more, anyway, because the reality is that I would have probably made a few impulse purchases while waiting in that line.    Sometimes I get annoyed when the clutter starts to overflow my living spaces, but in the end, I know that I can never fully embrace the whole Marie Kondo lifestyle, because while that rope didn't give me any particular joy until I used it for something I needed, the storage basket I made, DOES give me a great deal of joy.  It's functional, and it's pretty.  If I had taken MK's advice, I wouldn't have been able to make that lovely container.  For me, there has to be a balance of keeping vs. throwing away, because sometimes deciding that an item is not worth keeping based on whether or not it \"brings joy\" in the present, could result in a missed opportunity for joy in the future."},
{"title": "Will Your Thanksgiving be Depletion or Abundance?", "date": "Friday, November 12, 2021", "text": "I love all of the news reports about shortages this holiday season.  And by love, what I mean to say is that I find it amusing, but also worrisome, because the general flavor of the reporting falls firmly into that fearmongering that has been so much a part of the narrative for too long.  The message is \"Be worried!\"  \"You're going to be deprived!\"  \"Your family is going to starve!\" Really? I mean, is it the worst thing, ever, to NOT have a turkey at Thanksgiving?  There have been many Thanksgivings here at Chez Brown at which a turkey was not only NOT featured as part of our Harvest meal, but we didn't even have turkey on the table.  One year we had rabbit, because we raise rabbits, and they are, actually, a part of our harvest.  One year we had lobster, because we live in Maine and lobster is local, to us.  One year everything we had was local, and some of it was even foraged. We made an \"acorn pie\" using a pecan pie recipe and subbing acorns for pecans and our own maple syrup for the corn syrup the recipe called for.Recently, I saw a report that stuffing is going to be in short supply.  What?  The fact is that \"stuffing\" is super easy to make, right at home, with ingredients most people already have in their kitchens.  Bread (mine's gluten free, and any bread item will do.  I've made it with hotdog buns cut into cubes).  Broth or water.  Sage and other herbs.  Butter.  Onions.  I use celery salt rather than actual celery.  Stuffing does NOT have to be something that we don't get at Thanksgiving, because there aren't enough boxes of the premade stuff to go around.  Just sayin'.I read these reports ... well, mostly just the headlines, and I just shake my head.  And I wonder what the end game is for the people who are doing the reporting, or for the people who are asking that the story be told.  What do they want US to do?At the beginning of 2020, when there were reports of this pandemic happening in other parts of the world, and then, when it became clear that it was happening here, too, the grocery store shelves were stripped of all sorts of (to me) very strange items.  Nearly anything in a can or a box was snatched up.  There was no pasta or pasta sauce.  The cereal aisle was pretty empty.  In fact, most things in the center of the store - the premade stuff - was gone.  But there were plenty of eggs and flour for making pasta, and the produce aisle was as well-stocked as always.  I even found tomatoes for $0.25/lb.  Yes, that was 25 CENTS! per pound.  The problem was that those people who believed the headlines and ran out to the stores to get prepared were then criticized and called \"hoarders.\"  During that time, I actually saw a commentary by the food banks about how people should not be \"hoarding\" food, because then, the food banks won't get any of it, and they won't have anything to give their clients.  Say, what?  I think the biggest problem is that too many folks just don't know how or don't have the time or energy to cook for themselves, and they depend on boxed and prepared foods.  As prices continue to rise, this fact will make getting good food harder for the people who depend on convenience.My daughter is in the kitchen right now.  She's making lunch for herself and her boyfriend.  Lunch is a bagel with sausage, egg, and cheese, hashbrows (grated potato and onion, fried in butter), and sauteed broccoli with crumbled feta.  It smells as yummy as it sounds.  And not. one. thing. in that meal came in a box.  The sausage is from our pig share.  The eggs are from our chickens.  The broccoli is from my garden.  The potatoes and onion are from the farmstand.  The butter and cheese are both from local creameries.  The bagels are a local bakery.  I don't think my daughter is too worried about shortages this Thanksgiving.  I think she's pretty confident that whatever we have, it will be good, and she won't be hungry.The point, for me, is to be grateful and \"give thanks\" for the bounty of the harvest.  Getting fixated on the need to include very specific food items is not a part of the day for my family.Our \"harvest meal\" this year will be something like:Ham (part of our pig share) or smoked chickenGF sourdough bread potatoes, probably boiled and whippedBrussels sprouts or Kale, or bothBaked brie with a blueberry toppingPumpkin pie or custard, if we have enough eggs. If we believe we are being deprived, then we will feel deprived.  I choose not to feel deprived, and to be bit more resilient than those who are listening to the news and worrying that they won't have everything they need to make Thanksgiving a feast.  We'll have a feast, or at very least, just a nice meal.The next day, I'll slice up some potatoes, make a cheese sauce, add the leftover ham, top with the leftover stuffing or cubed sourdough bread, and bake for a cheesy potato casserole.  Sounds yummy, and even without boxed stuffing and a turkey, I'm pretty sure our bellies will be full. And that's what matters, right?"},
{"title": "Throwback Thursday - 21 Days Until Collapse", "date": "Thursday, November 4, 2021", "text": "In September 2008, I participated in a thought exercise that ultimately led to the writing of Surviving the Apocalypse in the Suburbs: the Thrivalist's Guide to Life Without Oil.The challenge, launched by G4s (Backyard) Homestead, was to imagine that we knew in 21 days something catastrophic was going to happen that would change the world as we knew it.  It was the imminent TEOTWAWKI.  What's funny is that, today, here in our world, 13 years later, the end of the world as we know it has happened.  We had a pandemic.  Our economy is in shambles.  We are experiencing massive shortages of everything from dog food to automobiles.  Everyone is (finally) admitting that Climate Change is a reality we are going to have to learn to live with as the weather gets weirder and more severe.What's disturbing is that I haven't really seen any significant changes in people's behaviors.  Or maybe I have.I met a woman at work the other day who has moved here from away to set up an off-grid homestead.  she had a LOT of questions.  I haven't met anyone, in person or online, in a very long time who was a \"back-to-the-lander.\"  I almost gave her a copy of my book to check out.  If she comes back, I will. But most people seem to be just hanging on to what they have, with no thought to what they will do as that life they knew pre-2020 doesn't return.  Like twigs in a flood - being tossed by the turbulent water with no control and no idea where they will end up. The temperature (finally) dropped below freezing last night.  It was our first frost of the year.  It's November.  That's unusual.In response to the warmer weather we've had, I planted peas in late September.  They never flowered (to become peas), but the stalks are lovely.  We can eat the leaves, and if not us, I can feed them to my rabbits.  It's something.Today's post is from back in 2008, when I was participating in the exercise inspired  by G4s.Enjoy!  And let me know what you're doing in response to what's happening in the world. ================================  Sunday,September 21, 2008Collapse:T-Minus Eighteen Days ... and CountingIhave it on goodauthoritythat collapse is imminent. We have eighteen days. ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Yesterday,I read the book ChristmasAfter All: The Great Depression Diary of Minnie Swiftfrom the Dear America Series. For the past two or three years (sinceI first heard about Peak Oil), I've been obsessed with 1930'sliterature and stories about the Great Depression. I finally readIronweedby William Kennedy. The book is lauded as one of the 100 Top 20thCentury Books written in English. I was expecting TheGrapes of Wrath,but unlike the Joads, most of Francis Phelan's hardships weredirectly related to his choices and actions. In short, had he donethings differently, it's more likely than not that he wouldn't havebeen forced to live in a shanty-town or visit the soup kitchens. Itwas because he spent the bulk of his money on alcohol and becausewhen he drank he was violent.In the 1930's era story, SisterCarrieby Theodore Dreiser, one of the main characters similarly experiencesfinancial ruin that is directly attributable to his choices. He seemsto want to be a sympathetic character, as does Francis Phelan inIronweed,and maybe I missed something, but I was unable to feel any empathyfor either character. In Dreiser's book, the guy became enamored ofCarrie, left his wife and stole from the company where he worked sothat he could run away with her. And then, when he found he needed toget a job, he wouldn't accept something that was beneathhim until it was too late to be anything but a scab.He made a lot of very bad, very selfish choices. In short, I felt hegot what he deserved.I guess the point is that we're nottwigs caught up in a stream, at least most of us aren't, and barringenvironmental catastrophe (which is what happened in the \"dustbowl\" areas of Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas panhandle), mostof us, while we may experience some financial hiccups in the comingdays, will have chances to adjust our lives as the market fluctuatesup and down. At the moment, there is still time.At the moment.We have choices. We have opportunities. And ifwe heed these early \"warnings\" and use this time to makesome changes in our lives, instead of trying to hang onto the sinkingship that is our \"modern life\", the coming storm will belittle more than an inconvenience. In all of the GreatDepression literature the common denominator is always food security.A person can tolerate a lot of hardship with a full belly ... or atleast the guarantee of a regular meal once a day.Food will bethe most important part of our preparations, and personally, I feelill-prepared in this area. I harvested most of my gardenyesterday. I still have some carrots in the ground and a few tomatoplants I'll let go until a killing frost. The broccoli plants thatnever gave a full head have some \"off-shoots\" on them(which is all they ever did this season). One has flowered, and I'mthinking I will let it go to seed and try my hand atseed-saving.For most things, it's too late for me to save theseeds, but there's no guarantee that I will find seeds in the spring,or that if they are available, I will be able to pay for them. Sowhile I was out yesterday, I stopped at the hardware store. Theystill had a few packets, though not much selection. I picked up about$4 worth (at 4 pkts/$1). If one isn't looking for \"specific\"seeds, now is a good time to stock up, as seeds can keep for years,if stored properly, and $0.25 per packet is a little better than the$1 to $2 per pack in the spring.I'll be planting the lettuceand spinach in the cold frame the beginning of October, and see howlong they go. I've already planted peas, broccoli, spinach and beetsfor the fall, and the peas and beets are REALLY loving the weather.My potato harvest was disappointing. I remember my grandma'spotato bin. It was 96 cubic feet and was full after the last summerharvest. They ate potatoes every day, usually fried. If we only havethe potatoes I harvested for the entire winter ... well, hopefully,Deus Ex Machina will get a deer ... and we still have $20 to spend atthe CSA. Maybe I'll use it all for potatoes ... and carrots.DeusEx Machina is picking apples with the two little ones today, and Iguess I'll be saucing into the night to get all of those applespreserved. Whether one believes in imminent collapse or not,winter IScoming, and for those of us in the northeast and other colderclimates, it means if food supplies become disrupted, for_any_reason,if we don't have a supply on hand, we'll have it pretty tough.Ifwe do nothing else to prepare, it would be to our advantage to havesomething to eat stored up somewhere. I hear those packets ofTaco Bell salsa can make a tasty soup."},
{"title": "Staying Fit - For Free!", "date": "Monday, November 1, 2021", "text": "Rule #1 in the movie Zombieland, for fighting/protecting oneself against zombies is cardio.  That is, if you can't beat them, you will join them.  Fitness is the key.The likelihood that any of us will be fighting zombies is pretty slim, actually, but being fit is probably a good idea, regardless of whether we're fighting zombies.  What's more likely than zombies is a lifestyle that is a lot more physical.  That is, the way things are going right now, it looks a good deal like we will need to be relying on our own muscle-power to get things done.  The problem will be for those of us who aren't accustomed to doing things by hand.  Going from zero to sixty is great in a Mustang.  Not so great when it's your body.The other day I walked to work.  It's not terribly far, although, when some of my colleagues found out that I walked - from my house - they were surprised, because it's far.  It's about two miles, and it takes me just over a half hour, which I think is a slow pace.  At the top of the one, very slow, long hill I have to walk up was a guy on a zero-turn riding lawn mower.  Not some spectacular sight, for sure.  Except that the lawn mower was nearly as long and as wide as the yard he was  mowing.  I haven't owned a lawnmower in a lot of years.  When I started turning my yard into raised beds, and forgot to plan the beds ... I was going to add \"taking into account the width of my lawnmower,\" but the fact is that I forgot to plan the bed placement.  I think I was just so excited to be getting the frames installed at the end of one of our winters, I just plopped them down and went to work getting seeds or plants in the ground.We bought a weedwhacker to keep the parts of the yard that aren't \"garden\" in check.  The area that I have to \"mow\" is equal to, or perhaps a bit larger, than the area that this fellow was mowing with riding lawn mower.  I had thoughts.  I was definitely making judgemental comments in my head.  To be honest, I have no idea what that fellow's overall physical condition was.  He might be the most physically fit person in my community.But there are a lot of people in my community who aren't physically fit.  Who think that walking two miles is a monumental task. Which is very sad and could be tragic.  See above:  if you can't beat 'em ....The problem is that when people start thinking about ways to get fit, we too often see in our head, things like a gym membership or costly personal fitness equipment.In fact, last spring, in March, as the snow started to recede, I decided that I wanted to take up running.  I used to be a good runner.  I could run a mile in around seven minutes, if I pushed hard.  I was clocked at running two miles in fifteen minutes and forty-five seconds.  That second mile was a bit slower than the first, which is how it usually goes.  Five miles would take a bit over 45 minutes, if I could keep a steady pace.That was a few years ... decades ... ago, and in the time between my runner days and today, I have spent much of it as a stay-at-home/work-at-home Mom, dividing my time between my desk job and my taxi-mom duties.  In short, I've spent a lot of time sitting and the only \"running\" I can honestly say I've done is running errands.  But I was determined.  I was going to run.  The only hitch in my plan was that I did not have any shoes that I could run in.  I have sandals.  I have clogs.  I have boots.So, my ever supportive and amazing husband and I took a trip to a local shoe store, where I purchased a pair of running shoes for myself, and he picked up another pair of cross-trainers (because his were developing holes, and it was time for a new pair).  And the next morning, I donned a pair of sweatpants, pulled my new shoes on my tender little feet, and set out.I ran.  For about a third of a mile, and I thought, \"This is not fun!  I'm pretty sure I never liked running.\" I did some sort of walking, running, walking thing for another third of a mile, and then turned around and headed back home.  I think I was gone about twenty minutes or so.  If you're keeping score, it took me twelve minutes to go one mile.  Twelve minutes.  I can walk a mile in 18 minutes, and I don't feel like I want to vomit afterward.  One expensive pair of shoes, I probably won't ever wear, and a huge lesson later, and here we are. The message I learned from that experience is that getting fit doesn't have to cost a thing.I stopped running after four days, but I didn't stop doing.  Over the past seven months, I have lost two digits of pounds and four inches from my torso (bust to butt), and I'm down a pants' size, which is both exhilerating and also annoying, because now I have to buy new pants.  So, how did I love 20 pounds and four inches, for FREE?Yoga Deus Ex Machina downloaded a free app that gives us three, five-minute yoga sessions per day, for free.  Two of the videos are the same every day, but the third changes.  One of the free videos is a chair yoga session, which I don't like, and we don't do, but the other two videos are great.  We've been doing 10 minutes of yoga five days a week since April.  The app is free, and while we do have Yoga mats, they aren't required, and if you have carpeted floors, aren't even necessary.  I will occasionally do one of the videos a second time during the day in the room with carpet instead of moving furniture and unrolling the mat.  The Yoga may have contributed to my weight loss, but the better result has been an overall strengthening in my core (abs), back, and arms.  I am thrilled with my increased upper body strength and the toned look of my upper arms.  You know that \"turkey wing\" phenomenon that older women experience?  Mine is mostly gone.  The free app is called Asana Rebel.  Hiking/WalkingWe are very fortunate to live in a place where there are dozens of beautiful hiking and walking trails.  In fact, we have a biking/walking trail right near our house.  While it was still cold out, we were taking our dogs out on the trail every Sunday for a two mile walk, until it got too hot for our big boy chow, who had Lyme disease as a pup, sustained long-term systemic damage, and has a hard time walking for any distance in the heat.  When the dog gave up on walking with us, we started looking for more challenging hikes and discovered a huge number of moderate hikes within a reasonable driving distance.So, yeah, it's not \"free\" exactly, since we drive to the mountain we're planning to hike, but we aren't buying any special equipment, either.  In fact, we have a long-running joke about the hikes we're doing.  We decide how challenging it is based on whether or not I can comfortably \"hike\" the trail in my Birkenstock sandals.  So far, the only mountain I have not hiked in my Birks is Mt. Katahdin.  I didn't even try on that one.We hike or walk two to five miles every weekend, when we aren't working wood.  And that's it.  I didn't change what I ate or when or how.I didn't count calories.I didn't pay a personal trainer. I didn't buy anything special.When I started working at the beginning of October, I added another two mile walk, twice a week, to what Deus Ex Machina and I were doing, and also, in the middle of September, we added some Adult Ed classes (Qigong and Country Line Dancing), which aren't free, but also, which are very low cost, and just a lot of fun. Both of those activities could be free, however.  The Tush Push is my favorite country line dance, and here's a video of how to do it.  My favorite song for this dance is John Deere Green by the late Joe Diffy.This dance style can be done to many different songs, and if you only learn one, the Tush Push is a good choice.   The other good choice for a dance that can be done to many different songs is the Cowboy Hustle.Both dances are fun.Both are great exercise, and if you get a fast enough song, it's a really good aerobic exercise.A couple of the forms our Qigong teacher have been published on YouTube.  Here he is doing the Meridian Wash.  We try to do this form at least once a week. I know what a challenge it is to find the energy and time to improve one's fitness level.  Believe me, I KNOW!  But what I've discovered over the past eight months, is that even just a little - a very little - five to ten minutes a day - can have a profound and noticable effect over the long term. All it takes is consistency and commitment.  And those are free, too."},
{"title": "Throwback Thursday:  Mavis Asked, I Answered", "date": "Thursday, October 28, 2021", "text": "Five years ago, I answered the challenge from fellow blogger, Mavis Butterfield of 100 Dollars a Month, to share ways my family saves money without sacrificing our quality of life.  I don't know whether my family would agree or not, but I just think that we have had an amazing life, and frankly, I don't think my children have ever wanted for anything, in spite of the fact that,  we are pretty frugal.Most of the things in the article are things we still do, and in many ways, we've even gone further down the path of frugality than where we were when I wrote this article.  For instance, I still don't purchase commercial cleaners, but I also learned to make soap.  So, the savings there is even greater, because I don't need to purchase those expensive Dr. Bonner's products anymore.  Here's the article from 2016, which was posted on Mavis' blog.====================================Likemore than two-thirds of Americans, I didn’t grow up on a farm. Bothof my parents did, and like most people of their generation, theyhoped to give me and my sisters a better life, which, for them, meantone where I would go to college so that I could get a good job withwhich I would earn enough money to support a middle class, suburbanlifestyle with the goal being that I wouldn’t have to struggle orwork as hard as they and their parents did.Likemany people in my generation, however, I grew up feeling somethingwas missing in my life, and while my parents had worked very hard toget me off the farm, I wanted nothing more than to get back on it.Unfortunately, because in my early adulthood, I’d followed thestandard American Dream (college, a career, a house, cars, kids, andpets, i.e. loans, mortgage, credit cards and debt-up-to-my-eyeballs),I was kind of stuck with a mortgage and a lifestyle that I justcouldn’t, easily, walk away from.So,I took Teddy Roosevelt’s sage advice, and I started doing what Icould with what I had where I am. At first, part of my motivation wasto make my life more eco-friendly, but ultimately, my goal was tolive more simply, which would translate to needing make less money,which would translate into not needing to struggle so hard in a job Ihated (in William Wallace’s words, FREEDOM!). In short, most of ourlifestyle changes were all about saving dough to get us out of debtso that we could quit working for “the man” and focus on doingwhat we loved.Tobe honest, most of the time we don’t feel like we’re saving anymoney. Most of the time, it feels like we’re right on the edge, andso I don’t, often, feel like I have any great how-to advice when itcomes to pinching pennies, but when I read articles on money-savingtips, I realize that my family also does a lot of the things thatother people do, and in some ways, we go a step beyond. So, I thoughtI would give it a shot.Asan intro, I live on a quarter acre suburban lot in southern Maine. Ishare my life with my ever-patient husband, who works full-time as anEngineer in Maine’s small, but growing, technology industry. Hewould rather be sitting by our fire pit, carving chess pieces andboiling maple sap to syrup, or walking through the woods huntingmushrooms. We have five children, two adults who have kids of theirown, and three younger daughters, who’ve made this lifestyletransition with us, mostly happily. We share our small home with fourbig dogs, three cats, seven rabbits, and a flock of suburbanchickens, who keep us supplied in eggs and eat all of the ticks inthe yard.  (update:  all the kids are, now, adults, and theanimal count has changed - fewer dogs, fewer rabbits, and a Parrot).Wehave several beautiful walking trails near our home. We like to takethe dogs out for long walks. I’mthankful to Mavis for challenging me to take a good, hard look at ourlifestyle choices. This has been a very fun exercise, and I hope it’suseful to someone else, too ;).1.How do you keep your food budget in check?Wepinch pennies for a lot of the things we buy, but for the most part,our food spending is not one of those areas where we choose to savemoney by buying the cheapest food. We like food – good, qualityfood – and we have a food sensitivity, which means we have to avoidcertain food additives anyway. We almost never purchase pre-packagedor boxed foods, because too often those foods contain ingredientsthat don’t meet our personal standards and/or they containingredients we can not eat. When we shop for food, we look for itemsthat are local, “in season”, organic, whole food, and/or containno GMO ingredients. Keeping spending under control is a realchallenge when what we buy is often a lot more expensive than some ofthe other choices out there.Assuch, being able to save in other ways on our food budget isincredibly important and so we’ve learned a few tricks a long theway.a.We trade convenience for quality. A local farmer has raw milk forsale on his farm. The caveat is that we have to actually GO to thefarm and pick it up ourselves and supply our own containers (buyingright off the farm is a legal option where I live in Maine). Raw milkpre-bottled at the health food store can cost as much at $10/gallon.We get it for a lot less, because we’re willing to take the lessconvenient route by going to the farm.b.As long as the food meets our standard, we don’t pass up theopportunity for free or cheap food. Last winter, my daughter saw adeer get hit by a car. In Maine, the person who hit the deer can,legally, take that deer home, after it has been tagged. The driver,in this case, did not want the carcass, and so we were able to takeit. We paid for butchering (although in the past, we’ve butcheredit ourselves), and ended up with 100 lbs of “organic” meat forunder $2/lb. In addition, we are often offered free, locally-grownproduce when someone’s garden is over producing. A few years ago, aco-worker offered my husband plums. He said that his plum tree wasproducing like crazy, and there was more food than he could use. Weended up with several 5 gallon buckets full of plums and made jellyand wine.c.We try to be as self-sufficient as possible. We live on a quarteracre in suburban southern Maine. We raise most of the vegetables weeat during the growing season, plus chickens for eggs and meat, andrabbits for manure for our gardens and for meat for us.d.We store what we harvest. There are a lot of ways to preserve food,and we’ve tried most of them. I didn’t start canning until I wasin my 30s, but since then, not only do I can everything I can getinto a jar. I’ve also salted fish, cured meats, fermented bothvegetables and fruit juices (wine), and dehydrated herbs, fruits, andmeats. When we first started storing food, preserving was a seasonalthing, and I had to make a decision about what I was going to do withit right when it came into my kitchen. Now, I know that I can takesome time. I can freeze the excess of berries now, and later, whenlife slows down (Ha!) I can make preserves. I can take thinly cutmeat from the butcher out of the freezer and marinate it anddehydrate it anytime I want. It takes some of the pressure off ofgetting it all done at once and has really expanded our ability tosave money, because we can purchase more, in season, freeze it, andthen, deal with it all later, to make room in the freezer for otherthings.e.We buy local food in season. During the summer, we spend a lot oftime at local farm stands and Farmer’s Markets. We also purchasemeat we can’t raise in bulk from local farms in the form of a pigshare or cow share. We pay the farmer for the animal (not the meat),and a local butcher to process the animal for us. It’s a flat, perpound rate for every cut, and so we pay the same per pound price forhamburg that we pay for filet mignon. It works out to a pretty gooddeal, and it gives us a nice variety of cuts to choose from.f.We learned to accept the gift of nature’s bounty. There is aplethora of wild foods, and over the years, we’ve learned toidentify, harvest and store what we are freely given. Our first wildfood of the calendar year is maple syrup. We started almost ten yearsago with three taps, and we now tap more than twenty trees – someon our neighbors’ land (with their permission – and we share thesyrup). Maple syrup is incredibly expensive, and we save asignificant amount of money per year by harvesting this wild foodourselves. We also harvest and eat: wild greens, wild game (liketurkey, which my husband bow-hunts), fish, clams, berries, invasiveplants like Japanese Knotweed, milkweed, some wild mushrooms(chanterelles, black trumpet, and lion’s mane), hazelnuts, and afew others. Many of those wild, free-for-the-taking foods are gourmetdelights that cost a great deal of money in the store.g.We barter. We taught a class on tanning rabbit hides and earned abagful of local produce and some loaves of artisan bread. We tradedrabbit for goat cheese. We traded duck eggs for homemade granola.h.Finally, we don’t waste food. We use every part of everything thatwe can. A chicken is cooked and eaten for several meals and the bonesare cooked into broth for soup later. Apple peels are made intovinegar. Pumpkin seeds are roasted and eaten. Seeds that aren’teaten are saved and replanted next year.Savingmoney on food could be difficult for us, because we like to eat well,but by making conscious choices and taking a little more time andcare, we can eat well and not break the bank.Anytips on saving for saving entertainment costs? Preferably ones thatdon’t require you to sit at home alone like a shut-in…Welove the theater. My youngest was a nursing baby when we saw Stomp!live. Her sister was four when we took her to see Cats. We took ourgirls to see the Cirque de Soliel, twice. My children have seen theNutcracker Ballet. We bought tickets for a series of plays based onchildren’s books (including Curious George and Imogene’sAntlers). Two of my daughters and I even saw the production of“Anything Goes” (starring Colin Donnell) at the Stephen SondheimTheater on Broadway in NYC. Unfortunately, tickets are incrediblyexpensive and going to the theater is not something we can afford todo as regularly was we would have liked.Luckily,we discovered the perfect solution. We became volunteers. Ourcommunity theater is always looking for volunteers for a variety ofjobs from set building and costume designing to hanging promotionalposters. Volunteers are paid in comp tickets. They also need ushers,and as part of the usher staff, we are allowed to stay and see theshow, for free. Our community theater does four shows per year, andfor the last three years, we have seen every show in every season,except one. My entire family volunteers. The people at the theatercall us “The Browns”, like we’re a collective, and we joke thatwe run in a pack. If you see one of us, we’re probably all present.My youngest daughter has been a volunteer usher since she was ten.Beingwilling to work as a volunteer has opened up many opportunities forus to enjoy local entertainment venues. As a volunteer at our localfood pantry, I had the opportunity to attend the Blues Festival, forfree, because the pantry had a donation booth that I was workingduring the festival. In the fall, our community group hosts a hauntedhayride. We volunteer to work as actors in the hayride, and we getfree tickets so we go on the ride, too.Everyyear there are dozens of agricultural fairs here in Maine. One of thebiggest and most well attended (by people from all over the country)is the Common Ground Fair in Unity, Maine. One year I found out aboutan opportunity to volunteer to man a booth that was sponsored by alocal foods group. I had to “work” for an hour, and our admissionto the fair for the day was free.Everycommunity has volunteer opportunities, and sometimes spending a fewhours working will yield an equal amount of free entertainment.Howdo you stretch your dollar when clothes shopping?First,let me admit that I hate shopping. I hate the flash and shiny of thestores that are designed to make me discontented with my beautifullife. After fifteen minutes of looking at all of the colors andpatterns and too many choices, I get a niggling headache. Whatreally irritates me is after I’ve checked out, because these days,there’s always that note at the bottom of the receipt that tells mehow much money I’ve saved. Um, no, actually, I SPENT money. I triedexplaining that to a cashier, once, who was very excited to show methat I’d saved $50. I said, “Actually, I spent $30. If I wantedto save money, I wouldn’t be shopping.” She didn’t understand.Unfortunately,with five children (two of whom are adults, now), I’ve had to learnto push through the discomfort and get the job done. There was a timewhen we looked for the cheapest clothes we could find (again,dressing five kids is expensive), but what we found was that the lessexpensive brands meant that we were replacing clothes and shoes moreoften, and so we had to change our tactics.Aftermany years of being disappointed and spending a lot of money, Ifigured out how to be smarter in our buying choices. The first thingI did was to avoid shopping centers except when we absolutely neededsomething, which means that we don’t impulse shop, which means wehave more money for things we actually need.Thesecond thing I did was to learn to shop at the best time, which iswhen no one else is. My children joke about February 15 being “candyday”, because it’s the day after Valentine’s Day and all of thecandy is on sale. The same wisdom applies to clothes shopping. If wewait until the end of September to back-to-school shop (and becausewe home school, we don’t really need to back-to-school shop), wecan get some great deals on clothes. Just after Easter, my daughterneeded some new clothes for the theater (black dress slacks or ablack skirt and white top). Winter clothes were marked down to 85%off the sticker price, all of the Easter dresses were on sale at halfoff, and many of the spring clothes were also at bargain prices (30%off or better). We were able to stock her up on shirts and jeans forthe upcoming warmer season, AND find a new ushering outfit for lessthan $70. The receipt said we saved $60.Ialso learned to love second-hand, which was no small feat. Growing upin the suburbs during the late 70s and early 80s, thrift stores, likethe Salvation Army Store, had a reputation of being for “poorpeople”, and at that time, being “poor” was viewed as a moralshortfall. My mother avoided second-hand stores. We were even loathto accept hand-me-downs from friends, even though we weren’twealthy and could have benefited from some quality clothes. Thesedays thrifting is an art form. Everyone does it, and everyone bragsabout their incredible thrift-store treasures.Thefirst time I voluntarily purchased clothes second-hand was when my,now, nineteen year old daughter was a baby (which, roughly, coincideswith the beginning of the shabby-chic movement). I had just relocatedto Maine and my very practical and thrifty Yankee in-laws introducedme to Goodwill. I was an immediate convert, and I’ve enjoyedbrowsing the thrift stores ever since, and I know where everyGoodwill within a 20 mile radius of my house is located. I even havea 10% discount card to Goodwill. For someone who has the time to looka little more closely, there is an opportunity to find high quality,designer label clothes at rock-bottom prices. My favorite find is my100% wool coat that I have been wearing for six years. I paid $5.It’s still in perfect shape. I usually pair it with the dog-furscarf my daughter knitted for me out of, yes, fur we collected whenwe brushed our dog, and we had spun into a super soft, beautifulchocolate colored yarn.Ofcourse, even buying new-to-me clothes still costs money, and the bestway I’ve found to save money on clothes is to wear the clothesuntil they just can not be worn anymore, which means learning torepair them. I love my Merino wool socks, but one pair costs over $8,and I can only wear them for a season before they get holes in thebottoms of them. A season, for me, is seven months of continuouswear, because it’s cold where I live, and I wear socks most of thetime. I learned to darn my socks so that they last a little longer. Irepair clothes that can be repaired, like ironing a patches in my tenyear old jean jacket so that I can keep wearing it, dying shirts thathave stains instead of relegating them to a rag bag or “workclothes”, and having shoes resoled instead of buying a new pair(resoling my Birkenstocks cost me $40. A new pair costs more than$100).And,finally, there is something to be said for learning some skillsassociated with clothes making, like sewing and knitting. My daughterknitted my dog-fur scarf for me, and I’ve been wearing it for sixyears. Our dog passed away in 2012, but I still have that scarf,which serves as a beautiful reminder of our companion and pet. WhileI don’t knit very much or very well, I do sew. For my first twopregnancies, I made all of my own maternity clothes. For many yearsat Christmas, I would make pajama pants for my husband and daughters.I’ve made dance costumes, toys, and quilts. I’ve made playdresses and dress-up clothes for my daughters. I’ve made skirts formyself. Last summer, using some old shirts, I made a pair ofunderwear and a new skirt. The best part of making my own clothes isthat I can tailor them to fit my body, which is just a half sizewrong for most off-the-rack clothes, which are usually just too tightor just too loose.Whatare your tips for being a gracious host to family and friends withoutbreaking the bank?Ilove to host parties. We have an annual “Brown Summer Party”,which can have as many as fifty invited guests. Having parties duringthe summer is perfect, for us, because we keep the guests outside,which means that we don’t have to do a lot of decorating, becausemy garden, full of blooming flowers, provides most of the décor.Inever ask my guests to bring food (although many of them will, andit’s fun to see the wonderful and eclectic selection of food). Wewill provide the main dish. The food we provide is usually home made,often from stuff we’ve grown or gathered. We love to cook fancytasting and sounding food, that’s actually super cheap. One of ourfavorites is Naan (which is grilled flat bread, and bread is justflour, water, yeast, sugar and salt) served with grilled vegetablesand meat on a skewer (Shish Kebabs – super fancy!). With a coupleof pounds of inexpensive meat cubed and marinated in a home mademarinade, seasonal vegetables cut into bite-sized pieces, and somebread, we can serve all of our guests a super-fancy, super simple,super inexpensive, super delicious meal. For beverages, we serve icedtea (home brewed for pennies, even when we use organic sugar),hand-squeezed lemonade, and our home brewed wine or beer.Wesave a ton of money on dishes and napkins, because we always use realplates, canning jars for glasses, metal forks and spoons, and clothnapkins instead of one-use paper or plastic. All of the dishes werebargains. They were either given to us over the years by friends orfamily members who were cleaning out, or purchased cheaply at thriftstores specifically for our parties. We keep them in a plastic bin inthe back of a closet, and they don’t take up any extra space in ourkitchen cabinets. We also have extra cloth napkins and table cloths,and special table decorations (like candle holders). These thingsmake our parties extra special, and because we can reuse them overand over again, have saved us a lot of money over the years.Wehosted my son’s wedding reception on our lawn. It cost less than$300, most of which went to pay for tables, chairs, and the tent. Ipurchased a script for a Mystery Dinner, and his wedding receptionwas a completely unorthodox Mystery Dinner party with a three coursemeal, including a Leg of Lamb (in our freezer from a lamb we’dpurchased from a local farmer) that was served by his youngersiblings and their friends.Lastfall, my daughter was cast in a our community theater production ofJekyll & Hyde. After the show one night, she invited the cast andcrew over to our house for an impromptu cast party. We had all beenat the show – my daughter was on stage, and the rest of us wereushering – and suddenly, I had a dozen people to feed. I hadn’thad any time to plan for a party at my house, and so I took a quickinventory, and then, started slicing. I made a plate with applewedges, sliced cheese and pepperonis, crackers, and kalamata olives(pitted). We also served chips and salsa, and popped a couple ofbowls full of popcorn. Everyone had a blast, there was plenty offood, and it didn’t cost me a thing, because it was food that wealready had in our pantry.Whenit comes to parties, what I’ve found is that cooking my own food isso much easier than trying to plan around ready-made food I can buy.Veggie trays from the grocery store are very convenient, but for $15,I can purchase twice the food from my local farmer, and a simple dipusing a mayonnaise base with a splash of red wine vinegar and acouple of teaspoons of herbs, is much better, and much healthier,than the preservative laden concoctions that come with the veggietrays.Tovacation or not to vacation? That is the question.Ilive in “Vacationland” two miles from the beach, within fivemiles of four amusement parks, and mile and a half from the drive-inmovie theater. There are three campgrounds in my town, if I reallywant to pay someone, but for no extra money, I can pitch a tent in myfront yard and have the exact same experience without having to spendhalf a week packing, and then another week unpacking and cleaning.There’scross-country and downhill skiing, snow-tubing, and ice skating inthe winter, hiking year-round, canoeing on huge inland lakes orkayaking on the salt marsh tidal river (or if I’m feelingadventurous paddling out to one of the islands off the coast, or evenmore fun, to the old Civil War fort out in the bay).Thereare lighthouses to visit. I can think of six different museums rightoff the top of my head – half of which I can get to by bicycle. Weeven have several “period” villages where we can experience “lifeas it used to be.”Ilive a couple of miles from the train station where I can ride therails from Brunswick, Maine to Boston, Massachusetts, and then, takea bus to South Station in Boston and head down to NYC or evenWashington, D.C. for a day trip (sleeping on the train on the wayback).Theshort answer is that I don’t vacation, because the only place Icould go that wouldn’t have something that I already have where Ilive is to visit family.Allof that said, I know that everyone doesn’t have the sameenvironment or amenities that I have. I live in a tourist-centriccommunity, and my entire community caters to having people visit hereon vacation. I can feel like I’m on vacation and not spend a dime.ButI also think we tend to ignore what our own communities have to offerbecause we’re always looking across the fence at that green grassover there, and ignoring the verdant growth beneath our feet. Ihomeschool my children, and when they were young, as part of ourstudy of geography, we traded flat travelers with other homeschoolersaround the country. The point was to “host” the flat traveler,taking him/her on adventures around our community so that the otherfamily could see what was here, where we live. They did the same withour flat traveler. What I discovered is that there are so manyamazing things to see and do in every community, and I think mostpeople don’t realize that, right around the corner, there’s avery cool thing. We often can save hundreds of dollars, just by“stay-cationing” and exploring what’s in our own backyards.Listthe top things you can do without, WITHOUT sacrificing quality oflife.AsI was compiling my list of things we do without, without sacrificingquality of life, I realized that they all start with the letter C.What’s great about all of them is that, not only am I notsacrificing quality of life, but I’m actually improving it, becauseby not having/using any of these things, we’re saving money.Thereare probably a lot more things we eschew without suffering, but theseare my Top Cs:a.Cable. I know a lot of people are dumping their cable service,because it makes sense. With online streaming options, like Netflixand Hulu, the only benefit to having cable (for non-sports people,like us) is that the shows are current. We don’t mind being aseason or two behind everyone else. Some people still use cable fortheir home-based Internet service. When we disconnected cabletelevision, we were using a DSL service through the phone company.When we disconnected our landline phone service, we also discontinuedDSL, and we are now using mobile Internet service. The overallsavings (allowing that we were also paying for cell phone service,and the landline was redundant), per month, is more than $70.Butthere was an additional, often overlooked, benefit to cutting cable.When we discontinued cable, we also gave away our television set andall of the peripherals. We have laptop computers and LED computermonitors (which use very little electricity, comparatively), and sowe can watch DVDs and stream online programming. After we stoppedusing our television and permanently disconnected the ghost loadsfrom the DVD player and the VCR, our electric bill was noticeablylower.Ifwe discontinued Netflix, and borrowed movies from the library or used the free streaming service from our local library, we could save an additional $15/month with no loss ofquality of life.b.Clothes dryer. I put up my first clothesline in 2007, bought anindoor drying rack a couple of years later, and gave away my electricclothes dryer more than five years ago. We line-dry/air dry all ofour clothes, all of the time, even during the winter, and yes, onclear, sunny days (especially those precious blue-skied daysfollowing a severe winter storm) with two feet of snow on the groundone can drive by my house and see clothes freeze-drying on my line.We save a lot of money both on the electricity it costs to operate aclothes dryer, but also on wear and tear on our clothes. The dryerheat is tough on clothes and causes the fiber materials to break downmore quickly. Our clothes last longer, because they aren’t exposedto the extreme heat of a clothes dryer.c.Commercial cleaners.  Ican’t remember the last time I purchased a product gearedspecifically toward cleaning a toilet or a bathtub. Most of the timefor cleaning, I use baking soda or vinegar and a good scrub brush.The closest I come to a commercial cleaning product is Dr. Bonner’sliquid soap, and I’ve been known to use it for everything fromwashing my hair to cleaning the toilets. For washing clothes, we makea powder detergent with washing powder, grated bar soap (usually Dr.Bonner’s), borax powder, and some essential oil. It works just aswell as a commercial detergent, and costs much less.d.Cosmetics (i.e. toiletries like shampoo and deodorant).  Thebest deodorant I’ve ever used is baking soda and corn starch mixedwith coconut oil and an essential oil (like lavender or Patchouli). Istore it in an old commercial deodorant container, and the only drawback is that I have to store it in the refrigerator during the summerbecause the coconut oil liquefies. I also don’t use commercialshampoos or conditioners. I use the same soap on my hair that I useon my body, usually Dr. Bonner’s and almond scented is myfavorite.Instead of perfumes, I use an essential oil. I’ve mademy own lye soap, which I really liked using. It’s on the list tomake more soon.Whenit comes to saving money, the best thing one can do for oneself is tolearn some skills. Cooking, sewing, gardening, and soap making areall fun projects, and really, it doesn’t take much longer tolay-out, cut-out, and stitch up a simple skirt than it does to hop inthe car, drive to the mall, find a parking place, pick through thehundreds of choices, none of which are ever exactly what we want, payfor the purchase, find the car, and drive back home. It really isless a matter of time than it is a cultural habit that tells us weare better if we work to pay for things that we could make ourselves,if only we took the time.

{"title": "Home Cooking in the Crockpot", "date": "Monday, October 25, 2021", "text": "My crockpot has been getting a workout these last few weeks.  This week was the last week for the Adult Ed classes Deus Ex Machina and I were taking this fall.  We had two - Qigong on Wednesday nights (which will continue mid- November) and Country Line Dancing on Thursdays (which will resume in January, hopefully!).  Both classes were a hoot, and really, line dancing is some crazy good exercise ... if you do it the way I do - lots of hips and flailing arms :).  There's no time to eat before class with work schedules being what they are, and so we eat after, but there's no time to cook dinner after class, if we hope to eat before 8:00pm.  So, I've been putting our dinner in the crockpot for the past several weeks, and it's been amazing.  Honestly, that crockpot has, totally, paid for itself - just in the savings from not eating out.  We won't even add the cost savings from the fact that there are always leftovers that Deus Ex Machina takes to lunch.We've had a lot of different meals.  My favorite is to throw a pork roast with seasonings for Carnitas.  The meat is served with corn tortillas or chips, lettuce, grated cheese, salsa, and sour cream.  Sometimes I will cook rice to serve with it instead of the corn tortillas.  Really, any roast in the crockpot is a good choice.  Beef roast topped with a tomato sauce, peppers, and onions is Yankee Pot Roast, and served over mashed potatoes.Another favorite is to add stew meat, potatoes, carrots, onions, and spices for beef stew.  The other day, I had to drive to work because my daughter needed a ride to her job, and I came home at lunch and threw stew in the crockpot.  It was done by the time we got done with our Qigong class.Sometimes, though, I just want the comfort of a good Mac&Cheese, but to make it the right way, which is not from a box and includes baking it, can be time consuming.  Really good Mac&Cheese includes a lot of cooking terms: boil, grate, mix, bake ....  I found a crockpot version that is so simple, I can't even imagine doing Mac&Cheese any other way, now.  And there's no need to pre-boil the pasta.   Just throw everything into the crockpot, close the lid, wait an hour, stir, leave it alone for another hour or so, and serve, and it's AMAZING!The original recipe called for Velveeta cheese, which I don't ever use.  So, I adapted it for my kitchen, and because I wanted it to be a full meal, I added ham and broccoli, both of which are optional and can be left out. Here's my recipe, using gluten-free penne or macaroni, and no Velveeta cheese.Creamy Crock-pot Mac & CheeseIngredients:12 oz pasta (I've used Penne and macaroni, both of which came out really good)14 oz shredded cheese (I used a mix of cheddar, Monterey Jack, and Pepper Jack)4 oz Feta (an additional 4 ounces of a shredded cheese would also work)3 1/2 c Half and Half1/2 c butter, cut into 1\" slices1 lb ham, cubed (optional)1 c  chopped broccoli pieces (optional).How To:1.  Put pasta topped with ham and broccoli in the bottom of the crockpot. 2.  Put butter on top of pasta, ham, and broccoli3.  Add shredded cheese.4. Pour in with Half and Half.5.  Cover with lid and cook on high for one hour.6.  Stir well.7.  Replace lid and cook for an additional hour.The only worry is to check the pasta to make sure that it's not overcooked and mushy, but even if it is a little well-done, it's still creamy and delicious, and so much easier than dealing with multiple pots and baking pans.  I like simple meals that taste really good and don't use many dishes ... because I love to cook, but I hate washing dishes."},
{"title": "Changing Habits/Saving Money", "date": "Friday, October 22, 2021", "text": "I've been watching all of the news about shortages and scarcity and increasing prices.  The \"theys\" have been telling us that *we* just need to get used to higher prices.  Sure.  Okay.  The problem, for a lot of people, is going to be that they can't \"get used to\" higher prices, because they are already living at that edge where the paycheck just only might reach to the end of the week.  More likely, they're good until Wednesday, but by Friday night, they're looking for a deposit.   According to this article, more than half of the American population is living paycheck-to-paycheck, which means higher prices are going to set them back.The options, as always, are to cut expenses or make more money.In the last month, Deus Ex Machina and I have done both.  Here's how:DIY - Car Maintenance.  Saved $20 - cha-ching!I learned a new skill the other day, and, frankly, I'm embarrassed that it's taken me this long.It started with blue lights in the rearview mirror on a long stretch of highway in Maryland.  Deus Ex Machina was driving.  \"The reason I pulled you over is that you have a brake light out,\" the very kind officer told us. \"If you were a resident of Maryland, I would give you a work order citation, and you'd need to have it fixed by xx/xx/xx, but since you're not a resident of Maryland, I will just give you this reminder slip to get it fixed as soon as you can.\"That was in May.I think we forgot.Two weeks ago, a very kind man pulled up next to us and called out his window, \"You have a brake light out!\"I was pretty sure I had a bulb somewhere, which is what I told Deus Ex Machina back in Maryland.  And sure enough, in the console, there was a bulb.So last weekend, Deus Ex Machina said, \"Let's change that bulb\", and he grabbed his wrenches, led me out to the car, popped the trunk, and walked me through how to change the bulb.Then, we checked and discovered that another brake light was out (the one in the rear window).  I did not have a bulb for that one, and so we ordered a couple of LED replacements.  Three days later, he showed me how to replace that one.Et, Voila!  All of the brake lights now work.  The bulbs cost, maybe, $12 (the LED bulb was a little more expensive, but should also last longer).  The labor was free.To have someone else replace it would have cost us $20 in labor fees.  By learning to DIY that particular task, we saved $20.Bake It! - Savings $2.50.  cha-chingIt doesn't seem like such a big deal, really, but as we've discussed here over the last several months, even something as small as $20 can have a big impact on our budget.  I save $24 a year on snack cakes by baking a cake and sending it with Deus Ex Machina for lunch.  Today, Deus Ex Machina took a piece of homemade apple pie to lunch.  It was in the freezer.  A whole apple pie (not gluten free) from a local bakery is $24.  If we cut it into 6 pieces, that's $4/slice.  A piece of homemade apple pie is around $1.50.  So, by giving Deus Ex Machina a piece of my homemade apple pie, we saved $2.50.  That doesn't seem like such a big deal.But that's the problem.  We often don't think that spending $2.50 is such a big deal, until we stop to add up all of those $2.50 purchases.Changing Habits - Savings $752 annually.  CHA-ching!I have recently started a part-time job.  It's a total fluke how I got the job, but I am incredibly thankful for this opportunity, and it really does feel like serendipity.  I am an assistant librarian at my local library.  Isn't that a hoot!?I work two days a week (this week it was three, because I was covering a shift for another employee).  I have been walking the two miles to work.  Deus Ex Machina picks me up at the end of the day, because we get off at, roughly, the same time, and my job is on his way home-ish.  He has also been driving our more energy efficient car, rather than his truck, because it costs about half the amount to fill up the car as to fill-up the truck, AND the car gets around 32mpg versus the 18mpg the truck gets. His job is just over 30 miles, round-trip, per day.  Which means he uses about a gallon of gas, per day, in my car versus the two gallons of gasoline per week that he was burning driving his truck back and forth.  The savings is about $15 per week in gasoline.  If gas prices go higher, so do our savings.  From his job to mine adds one mile to his commute (including the drive from my job to our house).  So, two days a week, he adds a mile to his commute to pick me up from work, but since I walk the two miles to work in the morning, instead of driving, we are actually saving six miles per week (it would be a four mile round trip drive, if I drove instead of walking). I won't be able to walk to work once it starts to snow, but if I drive Deus Ex Machina's truck and he continues to drive my car, he will continue to enjoy that $15/week savings in gasoline.  It will cost around $1.43 per week in gasoline (at $3.59/gallon) for me to drive back and forth to work two days a week.  If I come home at lunch, the cost will be $3 per week for gasoline.  I will need to drive for approximately eight weeks.  Our total annual savings from changing our habit - his driving the car instead of the truck, and my walking to work - is about $752 or about $62/ month.  So, maybe, $62 doesn't feel like a lot, but ....The average hourly wage here in Maine is $18/hour.  A savings of $62 per month works out to 3 hours of work, saved.  The bonus is that I am getting an amazing amount of exercise and having a lovely start to my work day, and Deus Ex Machina gets to drive my zippy little sports coupe rather than his big, clunky truck.  Seems like a winner of a deal to me.Although ...... I might need to get a new pair of cold-weather shoes that I can walk in, which will be expensive.  If I do get a new pair of shoes, it will be a pair of Birkenstock clogs, at a cost of around $145. The other day at work, I was joking with my colleague that I have a pair of shoes that are older than her son.  He's in the 2nd grade.  I am not ashamed to have been wearing the same pair of Birkenstocks since 2006.Most people have a love it or hate it relationship with Birkenstocks, but the fact is, they are a really good shoe, especially for the thrifty-minded.  According to this article, not only are the shoes superior for foot health, but the same pair could last, \"virtually forever.\"  So, an initial $145 outlay, with an $80 repair bill every 5 to 10 years, means an annual cost of about $22.50 over a ten year period.   A good pair of sneakers, which need to be replaced every year, costs $85.  One pair of Birks saves $62.50/year on the cost of shoe replacement. Now THAT sounds like a good deal to me!"},
{"title": "Ingredients are the Prepper's Gold Standard", "date": "Monday, October 11, 2021", "text": "This was an interesting article.  Basically, what they're telling us, is that we should get used to shortages.  A follow-up article quotes the head-honcho of Kraft Heinz, warning us that we should \"get used to higher prices.\" Shortages of certain foods and higher prices for the ones that will be available.I guess we've been warned ... ??In truth, the Prepper community has been sounding the clarion call for a very long time.  The article on shortages was interesting, because they mention a couple of highly processed items, like Rice Krispy treats, which will become scarce, and it, sort of, made me laugh.A couple of weeks ago, I did an analysis of the cost of purchasing individually wrapped, highly processed, snack cakes versus making my own cakes and sending pieces with Deus Ex Machina to lunch.  It saved $24/year, which isn't a lot, but as Melonie pointed out, thinking in terms of what I could NOW buy (like a tank of gasoline for my car) rather than focusing on the tiny annual savings, gave those values a higher ROI.  When I read that article and thought about not being able to purchase individually wrapped Rice Krispy treats, I will admit that I didn't have even a tiny bit of anxiety.  The fact is that I don't really purchase Rice Krispy treats anyway.I mean, I guess I like Rice Krispy treats, but the fact is they are so easy to make, I can't imagine why anyone would purchase them premade, except as a convenience if one is out and needs a quick bite, but to purchase them as a storage item, or as snack food, seems a little ... wasteful and silly.A few weeks ago, Precious decided she wanted to make Rice Krispy treats and asked me to purchase rice krispy cereal.  At the time, I figured one batch, and she'd be done.  Then, she wasn't, and I ended up making a few more stops at the store than I wanted.  Then, I just picked up a bunch of bags of tiny marshmallows from the grocery store, but in an effort to save some cash, I purchased the cereal, in bulk, from the online bulk foods warehouse, Boxed.com**, where I have been getting most of our groceries for the past several months.  Then, she was done, but we still had a lot of cereal and marshmallows leftover.Buying in bulk is an interesting experience.  I end up with far fewer items than I would get when I would shop at the grocery store, but what I've found is that I have a lot more choices.  I know.  That sounds counterintuitive, but bear with me for a second.I purchase mayonnaise in huge 46 oz containers from Boxed.com.  That's a lot of mayonnaise, which is good, because I use mayonnaise as a base for a lot of other stuff.  I like mayonnaise on my hamburgers.  I use mayonnaise on my French fries.  Add a little bit of Siracha, and it's amazing for a topping on a buffalo chicken wrap.  Add a few seasonings, and I have a salad dressing, a dipping sauce for vegetables, a sauce (like tartar) for fish, or a cole slaw dressing.   I don't purchase salad dressing anymore.  I make my own.  It takes about three minutes to mix up.  My simple recipe is:1/2 c mayonnaise1/4 c cream or half&half1 to 2 tbsp wine vinegar or lemon juice1 tbsp garlic powder and onion powder1 tsp salt and pepperherbs (which ones will depend on what kind of dressing you want)More mayo and less cream makes it more of a dip. For a ranch or house style dressing, I add dill and chives (from my garden).  One recipe I saw for ranch includes equal parts mayonnaise, sour cream, and milk (or buttermilk), which has quite a nice flavor.The amounts given in the above recipe are approximate and to taste.  Mostly, I've made this same sort of dressing so often at this point, that I no longer measure.  I just dump everything in a canning jar, add a lid, and shake well.  Et voila!  Salad dressing.  A bottle of ranch salad dressing is $3.99, and in the end, all you have is ranch dressing.Buying mayonnaise as a base for my homemade salad dressing gives me a lot more choices than just salad dressing.  The key is to see the possibilities and to be willing to experiment.  When Precious wanted to make Rice Krispy treats, I didn't hesitate to get the ingredients for her.  Rice crispy cereal is cereal, which can be eaten with milk, and maybe some fruit, for breakfast.  Marshmallows can be fire-roasted and used for S'Mores, or added to hot chocolate for a creamy treat.  Many cooks will top sweet potatoes with marshmallows.  There are a few uses for both the cereal and the marshmallows beyond *just* rice crispy treats.  And then, there are other options, like this twist on the \"treats\" - just add peanut butter! In short, when I saw the *warning* of shortages with the listing of the types of shortages we might be expecting, it was a laugh-out-loud moment, for me, because those things listed, mostly, are things we, preppers, can often reproduce at home using ingredients that we've either stored, purchased locally, or produced ourselves.This weekend, Deus Ex Machina and I visited the PYO apple farm, where we picked 44 lbs of apples, at a cost of about $1.13/pound.  I will make applesauce today, which I will can, and I will probably make applesauce several more times this week, along with dried apples, and maybe a batch of slow-cooker apple butter while I'm at work tomorrow.I might even make an apple Bundt cake (maybe using this recipe or some variation of it).So many options.   My mantra is \"store ingredients\", and that attitude and practice has proven incredibly beneficial to me and my family.  In these coming times where we might be experiencing shortages and higher prices, stocking up on ingredients and transitioning to a more DIY lifestyle, especially in the kitchen, will become even more important and more valuable than ever before.  While we are still in the midst of the growing season, consider heading over to the farmer's market and \"stocking up\" on some fresh, local produce.  Grab some eggs from that local farmer and pickle them, or do some baking and store the cakes and muffins in the freezer.  And consider buying ingredients in bulk from someplace, like Boxed.com, and learn to cook with whole ingredients.  ===========================Each morning, I write my to do list on the chalkboard in my kitchen.  One of the things I planned to do today was to \"prep soap.\"  A few weeks ago my friend taught me to make a liquid soap base, and \"prep soap\" means that I put the soap base in a jar, add hot water to dissolve the base, and add essential oils, and then, I use it for whatever it's going to be used for.  Today's soap prep is for the dish soap and laundry soap, which I have been making from that potassium hydroxide base my friend taught me to make.One of the items that was scarce last year was soap, and this year - and hopefully for evermore (as long as I can find potassium hydroxide, I guess) - that will no longer be an issue for me, because I learned to make my own. Soap making isn't difficult, and even if you mess up (which I did), it's still usable.  As long as the saponification process takes place, you have soap.  My last two batches of liquid soap base were imperfect, but usable.  One of them was scalded.  It still soaps up, and I'm using it to wash dishes and laundry.  The other \"base\" was not fluffy like it's supposed to be.  I guess I may have either over-stirred it, or added too much KOH.  It's still usable.  I can still dissolve it in water and put it in my soap dispensers.  The next batch will be better.  Or not.  The point is to keep trying.And having ingredients to make soap means that I don't have to worry if Dr. Bonner's experiences shortages, because I have everything I need to make my own. And there is nothing quite so empowering as knowing how to take care of one's self.**This is not an affiliate link, and I get no compensation if you follow the link and make a purchase at the

{"title": "Tools", "date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2021", "text": "We have accumulated quite a collection of tools in the years Deus Ex Machina and I have owned our house.  Most of them are fantastic and are used regularly - like my canning supplies and other food preservation equipment.  A few, though, we purchased for a specific reason, used them, and then put them aside and ... well, honestly, I, kind of, forget about them. Several years ago, I decided that I wanted to learn to make incense, and we found a sweet little kit through Rose Mountain Herbs.  I made a few cones, some of which I used myself, and some I gave as gifts at Christmas.  Then, I put the kit in a cabinet and forgot.  The other day I was chatting with my friend and mentioned I had purchased some incense sticks.   She said something about making my own, and I remembered that I could do that!  I can!  So, I went looking for the kit and found it, and she and I may get together in the near future to make incense ... like we made soap.  When I was making incense, the most difficult part was using the Barbie-doll sized mortar and pestle that came with the kit, and so after making that incense, Deus Ex Machina purchased a real mortar and pestle for me.  It's a gorgeous marble set.  We also bought one for him at the same time.  His is white and also very pretty.I guess we used them a couple of times, and, then, they ended up in a cabinet.When I talked with my friend about incense making, I remembered my mortar and pestle.Later that same day, I was dealing with a salt crisis.  I love Maine Sea Salt, but it is a very coarse salt with huge grains.  It's lovely on something like salted caramel, when one wants those large coarse crystals.  Not so great when I'm just salting my dinner.I have a grinder, but the Maine Sea Salt isn't big enough for the salt grinder to work.  Right?  The salt crystals are too big to salt my food, but too small to grind in the salt grinder.Which is when I had my epiphany, because those crystals can be ground with my mortar and pestle.And that's what I did.  I used the mortar and pestle to grind up the salt, which I, then, put into a salt shaker.Having tools is good.  Maine Sea Salt is more expensive than the grocery store brands, but I like the local aspect of the salt for a lot of reasons.  Buying local means I reduce my personal carbon footprint - which is important to me.  So, I didn't save any money by purchasing the Maine Sea Salt.I did save money by using the tools we already have rather than trying to purchase a new salt grinder, which may or may not work.  So, I will call this a win for $aving, because I avoided a new purchase by remembering that I already have the tools I need to get the job done.  Win!"},
{"title": "Online Thrift Shopping? This is a thing?  ", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2021", "text": "I'm going to be honest.  I actually don't enjoy shopping, just in general.  I don't know that I ever, really, have, especially for clothes or household goods.  I used to enjoy grocery shopping with Deus Ex Machina on Saturday mornings.  It was a whole experience.  We would drop our daughters off at the dance studio, and then, go to the grocery store together.  We were there on the same day at the same time, and we discovered there were dozens of other shoppers who did the same thing.  We started to recognize people, and they, us.  We found out that the employees also recognized us regulars and would give them nicknames.  Like the \"no pants lady\" who always wore a thigh-length, white turtle-neck sweater (no leggings or pants, though) and flip-flops - even when it started getting really cold.  I always imagined that she was a reclusive writer, and grocery shopping was one of those necessary evils, because she needed coffee, but she would have preferred to have stayed at home working on her book.  Deus Ex Machina and I were the \"fun couple,\" because we joked and laughed a lot.  Then, our lives changed.  There was no more Saturday morning dance class drop off.   There were new jobs for both Deus Ex Machina and me.  The pandemic happened, limiting the number of  people allowed in a store, and so only one of us could do the shopping.  It fell to me, which was unpleasant on so many levels, including losing my \"fun\" partner.  I started looking for other options for getting groceries into my house, and finding grocery delivery services solved the problem of having to go to a physical store, but there are other things we need, besides groceries.  At the beginning of the pandemic, many stores closed down, not that I was heading over to the mall for an afternoon of retail therapy anyway, but for a few weeks, between March and sometime in May 2020, while everyone figured out how to respond to this health threat, the second-hand clothing shop I used to go to was just shut down.  I didn't know if it would reopen.  They didn't know IF they would be able to reopen. They did open back up with limited hours, limits on the number of shoppers allowed at a time, and curbside pick-up available.  Like every where else last year, masks were required for in store shopping.For the record, I'm not an anti-mask person.  I wear it, when required, but it is not comfortable, and I do have a difficult time with it.  First, I wear glasses, and not just glasses, I have progressive lenses (which are fairly new to me to begin with.  I've only been wearing prescription glass for about three years, and my first pair, ever, were progressives).  For those who don't know, basically, a progressive lens gives me two places on my glasses to look out of.  I have one prescription for seeing things that are up close (like this computer screen) and one prescription for seeing things that are far off (like when I'm driving).  The mask interferes with my ability to see the close up stuff, because the way the mask sits on my face changes the way the glasses sit on my face.  I have to read labels at the grocery store, because sometimes gluten is hidden in the ingredients (did you know that gummy bears are made with \"wheat sugar\"?), but the way the glasses sit on my face with a mask on makes doing that very difficult.  And then, the glasses fog up, and I can't see anyway.Second, I have two big dogs and three cats, all of whom shed rabbit-sized puff balls.  All of my clothes are covered in fur.  It's just a part of my life.  With no dryer to remove the fur and lint, those things stay on the mask.   When I get the mask on, I invariably inhale a hair, which starts to tickle, and then, I need to cough, and well, don't cough in public these days.  I'm pretty sure there's a tangle of pet fur in my lungs.So, if I can avoid wearing a mask, I do.Which has made online shopping my best option.Amazon is like the online Walmart.  My opinion about Walmart and the fact that I haven't shopped there in more than a decade, is well known.  I don't shop on Amazon, if I can help it.I have purchased items, if I know what I want, direct from the manufacturer - like Dr. Bonner's soap.But I was having a hard time with the whole clothes shopping thing.  Did I mention that I don't like shopping?  I enjoy, even less, shopping for clothes for myself (although I will happily shop all day for clothes for Deus Ex Machina).  I never try things on, because I just don't like taking off my clothes in the store - even in the relative privacy of the dressing room.  I think it's just too cold in most of those stores.  Or ... I don't know.  Is that a two-way mirror?  Silliness, but there it is.  So, I don't try on the clothes, and I bring them home, and too many times, they don't fit.  Or the style looked good in the store, but not on me.  Then, I can either take it back (I hate shopping, remember?  I hate returning items even more), or I can leave it in my drawer until I start thinning my clothes and then donate the never-worn item a few years later.  Sometime during the pandemic, my daughters signed up for this service called StitchFix**.  It's a pretty interesting business model.  Basically, you sign up giving them your style preferences, and they will select clothes that match what you say you like to wear.  They charge a $20 \"styling fee\" to send the box to you, and then, if you choose to keep any of the items, they will apply that $20 toward your purchase.  It sounded fun, and so I signed up.  My first box was a disaster.  Nothing in the box was anything that I would ever wear.  I sent it all back.  They sent another box, right away, at no extra charge, and I ended up keeping two things - a lovely faux-wrap dress and a pair of white capris jeans.  The funny thing is that I would never wear white pants.  But those jeans were so wonderful and fit me so well, that I kept them, and I've worn them half a dozen times. What's also nice about StitchFix is that they are committed to being socially and environmentally conscious, but the clothes are new, never-been-worn, and while new clothes are nice, I have a hard time with the ethics of the fashion industry, in general.  If I can get my clothes second-hand, I will.  In fact, until 2020, all of my clothes were second hand - except shoes (which I will repair rather than replace) and my undergarments, which I always purchase new, because ... sanitation.I was watching a Do It on a Dime video recently, and Kathryn was talking about this clothing service that she uses.  It's, basically, the same model as StitchFix - order a \"goodie box\", and at regular intervals, they will send you a box of clothes.  You try them on in the warmth and comfort (sans the possibility of two-way mirrors) of your own home.  Keep what you like and return (in their self-addressed prepaid envelope) what doesn't fit your body and/or style.  The difference between StitchFix and the service Kathryn mentioned in her video is that ThredUp is an online consignment shop.  Get that?  It's USED clothes, and members can both purchase AND sell clothes.  It's exactly like my local brick-and-mortar designer clothes consignment shop, except I get to try on the clothes here at my house; I don't have to sort through the thousands of clothes they have available to find the one or two things that might fit my body-type and style, because I have a personal stylist who does that for me; and I don't have to worry about things like masks and that girl who keeps crowding me, because I've been standing in the sweater aisle for longer than 30 seconds.  Thrifted clothes without having to go to the store??  I'm calling it a WIN.  I ordered my first goodie box from ThredUp this morning, and I'm looking forward to seeing what they send.If you have used either ThredUp or StitchFix, I'd love to hear about your experiences.On a side note, Deus Ex Machina and I stopped in at Goodwill the other night looking for an old tent for a project we're working on.  We didn't find a tent, or anything else we wanted.  What we did notice was how crowded the store was, and that plates, which we used to be able to purchase for less than $1 each are now 3/$8.  The price more than quadrupled.  I didn't look at any of the other prices.  It's crazy!  Everything is going up.  Even the Dollar Store has decided to raise its prices.  Everything is no longer just $1.  **This is a referral link.  If you sign up for StitchFix using my link, I will get a $25 credit toward my next purchase with them.  ;)."},
{"title": "Stocking up ... in Plain Sight: Foods You Can Store as Fall Decorations", "date": "Thursday, September 30, 2021", "text": "There's a radio commercial out right now.  I don't recall what the product is, but I do recall some of the content of the commercial.  The commercial starts out by saying something about what Mainers say about Maine.  One of the comments is, \"Maine has two seasons: winter and preparing for winter.\"  There is definitely a nugget of truth to it, although we do very much enjoy \"mud season\" and \"black fly season\" also (both are in Spring), and there is no equal to our fall colors, but really, Spring is just \"end of winter\" and in the fall, we're still \"preparing for winter\", which is right around the corner.I think, on some level, most Mainers are probably preppers - whether that's what they call it, or not. Winters are long, and getting ready for winter is just what we do.  Our growing season is really short, and those who have a garden are also canners, because our growing season is really short, and we need to get as much out of it as we can.  Nearly everyone I know does some food preservation.  Here in southern Maine, where I live, there are farm stands on just about every corner, and most them carry the same sorts of things: pumpkins, apples, corn, potatoes.  All the things my family loves to eat.  But those are also some pretty stellar decorations, this time of year, especially.It got me to thinking about the way we, my family, stocks up, and the fact is that we spend a lot, this time of year, building our winter stores.  Since I live in a small house with very limited storage, it's pretty awesome that a lot of the stuff I want to store is also very decorative, and what's also pretty cool, is that, since they are decorative, those food items might be overlooked, on first pass, by someone who is wanting to take my eats. One of my favorite fall \"decorations\" is corn.  I like to grow popcorn, because it's pretty, first of all, and I can dry it from the overhang in my dining room.  It looks pretty - like a decoration - but it's also food.  But since it's not in the kitchen, it won't be the first thing someone sees if they are looking for food.We've also \"hidden\" beans (in their husks), peppers, and herbs strung up to dry, but looking like a decoration.I also love my garlic braids.  These are in the kitchen, but they are hanging up instead of being in some sort of storage bin or in a jar or something.  So, again, it looks more like I'm going for a \"country kitchen\" aesthetic with some Pottery Barn decorations than that I am actually storing something we will eat at some point.Pumpkins are probably my favorite food decoration.  We buy a bunch of jack-o-lantern pumpkins every year.  While they are a bit stringy for eating we do save the seeds, which I roast.  And even if we don't eat them, my chickens do.I also grow or purchase a bunch of pie pumpkins.  These are smaller and denser and are quite lovely as a centerpiece on my table (when we're not using the table as a desk).  No one is going to look at the centerpiece on the table as potential meal.I have a few things in my garden that aren't well known as a food source.  One of my favorite \"hidden\" delicacies is the sunchoke.  It grows 12' tall and blooms with this lovely yellow flower in the late fall.  The good part is underground.  It's a tuber that looks a lot like ginger and can be used much as one uses potatoes.  Sunchokes are incredibly hardy plants and also very invasive.  They are native to this part of New England, and while they aren't one of my favorite foods, I keep them in my garden, because in a worst case scenario, it's food that not many people recognize as food.  The best part is that they don't have to be all harvested.  We can leave them in the ground and harvest them until the ground freezes.  In the Spring, we an harvest them until they start to grow.  I leave the dead stalks, all winter, which tells me where they are so that I can dig them in the spring, but also, because the pith in the stalks is food for the birds that over winter here.  Another popular outside decoration is straw bales.  Interestingly, if done properly, those straw bales can be used as a cold storage for potatoes, at least in the early part of the season.  From this article on ways to store potatoes: In a shady spot outdoors, place a tarp over the ground and cover it with an inch of loose straw. Pile on potatoes and cover with more straw, a second tarp, and a 10-inch blanket of leaves or straw.One can also store the potatoes in a rodent proof container in a hole in the ground and place the straw bales on top of the container.  The straw will serve as insulation to keep the potatoes from freezing, and also be an easy way to find them, when it snows.  We just placed a bulk order for potatoes, and I'm definitely going to be using some of those storage suggestions.  We have several bales of straw outside, which we used as seating for a recent gathering of friends.  Shoving the potatoes into the straw will keep them, at least for awhile, and then, any we missed in the spring, will sprout and grow.  More potatoes is not a bad thing.  And in a TEOTWAWKI situation, who's gonna think to look outside in the straw bales for food?Since storage is a premium and there's just no chance that I'm going to spend money on a storage facility to hold my preps, finding items that can be stored in plain sight is my preference.  Stocking up on fall foods that I can store out in the open as a decoration is a huge bonus."},
{"title": "The Price of a Snack Cake", "date": "Thursday, September 23, 2021", "text": "When I was kid, I used to take my lunch to school every day.  It was a rare and delightful treat when my mother would purchase snack cakes to go in our lunches.  My favorite was Little Debbie's Oatmeal Cream Pies.  Most of the time, though, my lunches were a peanut butter sandwich on sliced white bread and a little baggie full of Chex Snack mix.  I know.  Super nutritious.  Don't judge.  I was a kid.I don't eat Little Debbie's cakes anymore, because they are not gluten-free.  Being gluten-free means that we have a much smaller selection than other folks have.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you.  It's made me a pretty good cook.  And, believe it or not, it's saved us money.Deus Ex Machina takes his lunch to work every day.  I think I've probably mentioned it.  I usually pack his lunch with leftovers, and I usually make enough at dinner to have at least one lunch during the week.  If he purchased his lunch through the cafeteria at work, it would cost between $7 and $15/day.  So, just cooking extra and packing leftovers saves us $55 a week x 48 weeks (allowing for vacations and holidays) is $2640/year in savings. Some days, I really enjoy something a little sweet for after dinner, which is why I like making the cakes I mentioned in my last post.  Dessert AND preserving eggs??  Win/win!!And because I have made so many cakes over the last few weeks, there has been enough for dessert, the freezer, and Deus Ex Machina's lunch.  In fact, the pieces in the freezer will probably end up in his lunch at some point.After I published the post, I got to thinking about how much it was costing to make those cakes each week, and what the difference in cost would be if we purchased snack cakes for Deus Ex Machina to take to lunch instead of my homemade cake with store bought frosting.Each cake is a 9'x11' sheet cake.  Our favorite flavors are applesauce spice cake and pumpkin spice cake.  I was using the applesauce I canned last year for the applesauce cake until I ran out of applesauce.  Unfortunately, I don't have a cost for the jars I canned, and so I can't make a cost comparison.But I do have a cost for the pumpkin cake.I use King Arthur measure for measure gluten-free flour.  I get a 3 lb bag from Boxed.com for $7.99.  Each cake uses 2 cups of flour.  I can make 5 cakes with a 3 lb bag of flour.I use Florida Crystals raw sugar.  I get a 3 lb container from Boxed.com for $5.39.  Each cake uses 2 cups of sugar (although I do cut it a little, because 2 cups is a lot of sugar and makes it just a little too sweet).  I can make 5+ cakes with a 3 lb container of sugar.Each cake uses a 15 oz can of pumpkin.  I can get a can of pumpkin at the local grocery store for about $2.  The cake also uses eggs and a bunch of spices.  I can add raisins and nuts, if I choose. Each cake also uses baking powder.  An 8 ounce container is $1.29.  I use 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder per can, which works out to about 32 cakes.The flour, sugar, pumpkin, and baking powder bring the cost of the cake to about $2.70.  If I assume the cost of the eggs and spices is around $0.30, and round up, the whole cake costs me $3.I don't make a very good frosting.  It's a skill I'm still learning, but I can get a can of pre-made frosting for $1.99 at the little Mom&Pop grocery 2 miles from my house.  I can frost two cakes with one can.Which brings the cost of my cake to $3.99.The cakes I make are 9'x11' sheet cakes, which I cut into 15 pieces.  The cost per piece is $0.26. So, I was curious, and I looked on Boxed.com to see if they carried Little Debbie's Oatmeal Cream Pies.  They do, in bulk.  The have a box of 24 snack cakes for $8.89.  Each of those cakes is 2.6 ounces.  The cost per cake is $0.37.My pieces of cake weigh in at a hefty 4 oz each.  So, my cake is $0.09 cheaper and 1.4 ounces bigger than the Little Debbie's Cakes.  And with fewer preservatives, maybe a little healthier ... ?If Deus Ex Machina took a snack cake to lunch every day, the cost would be $88.80 per year - just for a 2.6 ounce plastic wrapped cake.  Making my own cake, which I send with him for lunch saves $24 per year.  I mean, $24 doesn't sound like much, for sure, but when we figure that the cost of his lunch is free, because it's worked into the price of yesterday's dinner, saving an additional $0.09 per day for his dessert is pretty good."},
{"title": "My Favorite Four Ways to Preserve Eggs", "date": "Tuesday, September 21, 2021", "text": "I love my backyard chickens, as I'm sure I've mentioned a time or two.  I never got chickens as a money-saving thing.  It was really about food security and self-sufficiency.But also, having the chickens is just fun.  Chickens are quirky and funny, and anyone who tells you that they don't have personalities hasn't been around chickens very much.  Each of my chickens has her own little personality, likes and dislikes, and habits.  The only problem with them is that they aren't very consistent when it comes to providing a steady food source.  During the summer, they are egg-laying fiends.  We have 16 laying hens who are six months to 8 years in age.  The younger chickens lay pretty consistently every day.  The older hens, not so much.  We have one very old girl, who is blind in one eye, but still manages to find her way out of the coop regularly.  I found her stealing tomatoes from my garden last year.  She is the only one who lays white eggs.  We get a white egg once a week, or so.  All total, we are collecting 5 to 8 eggs per day, which means there are a LOT of eggs in our refrigerator at any given time.  During the summer, we will have three dozen eggs in our refrigerator, consistently.Sometime around October, when the days are shorter and cooler, the chickens start to slow down on the number of eggs they give us per day.  By December, we'll be lucky if the three youngest hens are laying every day, and in February, we might find 5 eggs a week.  That's just how it is, and it's not the cold, but rather the light.  Some people will provide heat and light to their chickens.  We don't.  We like to keep things as close to their natural rhythms, as possible.Which means we either gorge ourselves on eggs all summer long, or we find ways to preserve them to use over winter.I've seen some suggestions for preserving eggs, like salting them, or dipping them in a lye solution.  I haven't tried those sorts of preservation methods, mostly, because I am not certain of how I would use eggs preserved in such a fashion.  But I do have some ways that I have preserved my eggs for use during the winter.Boiled, Chopped, and FrozenWhen I was a poor college student, I worked at a quick-service to pay my bills.  One of the restaurant's menu items was a seafood salad which was made with shrimp, imitation crab, celery, chopped eggs, a special seasoning, and \"Special T\" sauce, which was basically mayonnaise.  The eggs were boiled and chopped up, and then frozen.  When we used them, we added them to the salad mix frozen, and they thawed before they were served to the customer. I don't use this preservation method as much as some other way, but this would be a good way to save the eggs to use later as egg salad on a sandwich, or something similar.Cracked open, whisked, and frozenI've used this method a few times.  Basically, we crack the eggs into a muffin tin - one egg per hole.  Each egg is about a quarter cup.  Then, we put the tin in the freezer. When the eggs are frozen, we take them out of the tin, and put them in a freezer storage container for longer term storage.To use, take them out of the freezer and allow them to thaw.  The best way to use these eggs is in baked goods.And speaking of:Bake into breads, cakes, and muffins and freezeOne of the only reasons I want eggs during the winter - other than a quick and easy breakfast for Deus Ex Machina - is so that I can bake bread and cakes.  It's taken me a lot of years to realize that autumn is the best time to bake these confections and then freeze them for use during the winter.  Over the past several weeks, I have been baking a cake every Monday and Wednesday, and occasionally adding some bread and muffins to the oven.  Any pieces left from Monday's cake on Wednesday, end up in the freezer.  By full winter when there is snow on the ground, we will enjoy being able to reach into the freezer for a blueberry muffin, a piece of cake, or a loaf of bread.Pickling I have to admit that my favorite way to preserve eggs is through pickling.  I boil a dozen or so eggs, peel them, and then, add them to a half gallon sized jar with bite-sized sausage pieces (like Kielbasa, Chorizo, or Andouille).  I mix up a very simple vinegar-based pickling brine.  Basically, 1:1 vinegar and water, and 1:1 salt and sugar.  For a half gallon sized jar, I mix 2 cups each of vinegar and water, and 2 tablespoons each salt and sugar, bring it to a boil, pour it over the eggs and sausage in the jar.  Allow to cool, and put in the refrigerator.  After about three days, the eggs are pickled enough to enjoy.  The longer they stay in the brine, the more \"pickled\" they become.  I also like to pickle the eggs with jalapeno slices.  I love pickled jalapenos and I LOVE eggs pickled with jalapenos, but I like it spicy. In a powered down situation, I could preserve my pickled eggs by pressure canning them, but at the moment, I don't do that.  I have also, in the past, canned pumpkin bread, which seemed to do okay, but it must be made to very strict specifications, and the use of a preservative, like that found in Crisco shortening, is recommended to prevent botulism.  Since I don't use Crisco oil, freezing is the way I preserve bread, at the moment.  How do you preserve eggs?  As  a note, when I was in college, I was fortunate to be eligible for the WIC program, because I was both a young, poor college student and a young mother with very young children (my two oldest were born while I was still an undergraduate student).  Part of the WIC offerings included a dozen eggs per week.  I didn't use that many eggs at that time, and so I had to figure out what to do with all of those eggs.  I didn't preserve them, because I didn't know how back in those days, but I did have this fabulous cook book - 100 ways to Cook Eggs.  It's been long lost in the decades since I was a college student, and I wish I could find another copy.  Alas!I learned about making quiche from that cookbook, and indeed, one of the prepared, cooked foods, that I still make and freeze from my excess of eggs is quiche.I just mention it, because having a glut of eggs isn't just a result of having backyard chickens.  In fact, sometimes when eggs are on sale, for those who buy eggs, getting some extra and making a few cakes for the freezer isn't a bad idea."},
{"title": "Garden Harvest", "date": "Tuesday, September 14, 2021", "text": "I injured the ring finger on my left hand.  Deus Ex Machina and I were joking about how it's never a cool story - like \"I was fighting the zombie hoards and tweaked my finger!!\"  Mostly it's, I'm a woman of age, and things happen.  We believe it is a mallet finger injury - i.e. a torn tendon.  I'm certain it's not broken, and I am not in any pain.  So, that's a plus.  I just can't straighten my finger.  Ugh!But, I have a special splint (that Deus Ex Machina 3D printed for me), which makes typing hard.So, instead of a long post, I will share today's garden harvest:  beans, broccoli, tomatoes, and grapes.  Two weeks ago, my granddaughter came over and we planted peas.  They're about six inches tall now.  I'm looking forward to an October harvest of peas from my garden.What's happening in your world?"},
{"title": "My Kitchen", "date": "Thursday, September 9, 2021", "text": "A little while ago, Nancy from Little Homestead in Boise asked to see my kitchen, specifically, my food prep areas.  I have a very small, galley-style kitchen.  When we purchased the house, it was listed as having an \"eat in\" kitchen, because on the right hand side of the kitchen (where we now have a pantry cabinet, an upright freezer, a pull-out storage shelf, and our refrigerator), the previous tenants had a cafe-style table with two chairs.  I mean, I guess that's technically an eat-in feature, but I don't think that's what that normally means in real estate listings.  The seller's realtor was trying to be clever, I think.Here's my kitchen.  Nothing about my kitchen is standard, and so we've had to be a little more creative with adding storage and functionality without spending a ton of money.  Renovating the kitchen has never been in the budget, although there has been some painting and some ripping up and replacing of linoleum.  There are no drawers in my kitchen, probably because the counter is not a standard height.  The positive is that I don't have a \"junk\" drawer in my kitchen.  The bad news is that there is no utensil drawer, either.  I have a carousel for the cooking spoons and spatulas, and a cute little square storage box with canning jars for my flat ware.  Both are on top of the dishwasher.  Having non-standard height counters also means that we can't have a regular, built-in dishwasher, even if I wanted one.  I mean, I do want (and have) a dishwasher.  I just don't have a full-sized one.  At the front left of the picture above, on the black metal cart, is our counter-top half-sized dishwasher, which we purchased used for $100.  It is a real bargain.  Also, it's half the size of a regular dishwasher, and it costs about a third of what running a full-sized dishwasher costs.  We don't wash pans or large dishes (like my mixing bowls) in the dishwasher.  Mostly it's for plates, jars, and flat wear.  The dishwasher is portable, and I have to wheel the cart over the sink and attach it to my faucet.  But the bonus of having the dishwasher on the cart is more ... storage!!!  Which is a huge bonus in a small kitchen.At the far end of the kitchen is the ...  Pantry RoomWe actually call this the \"dog room\", because it's where we feed the dogs.  There is a weird little angled wall with a built-in shelf that we use to store canned food and bulk spices.  I'm certain there is something behind the wall, that some previous owner was trying to hide or just didn't want to deal with - probably some sort of plumbing or pipe they couldn't remove (like for an old woodstove, perhaps).  I don't know, for certain, and I'm not going to tear up the walls to find out (yet).Opposite the angled wall is a window.  We added another shelf for more canned goods storage, and we were gifted the bureau.  We use that bureau to store the kitchen towels and linens (like table cloths), cat food, some of my kitchen tools, like the vacuum sealer, and my soap making supplies.  The louvered doors lead to a bedroom.   Our bottle return bin is next to the bureau.  Beside the bottle return bin is a wall that has an access door for the furnace, which is in a little room behind that red curtain in the first picture.  That room also has a water heater, our recycling bin, my mop, broom, and vacuum cleaner, and the cat litter box. Food Prep/counter topThis is my only counter, and I do all of my food prep, canning, etc. in that space.  Sometimes it's a little like playing Tetris, trying to can or cook big meals.   I have a cutting board that fits over half the sink, which I can use to extend the counter space.  I added that shelf to the back of the counter, and honestly, it has made a world of difference in reducing the LOOK of the clutter on the counter, because rather than having a bunch of random jars just hanging out on the back of the counter, everything is contained under the shelf, or stored on top of it.  And it's the perfect place to keep the big jar of coffee for easy access at Oh-Dark-Thirty, when I get up to start my day.  I keep recipes I use a lot on the fronts of the cabinets, but also taped inside the cabinet doors.  Having the recipes at eye level is easier than using a cookbook or my phone, and there's a fun story about that ... .  The lowest cabinet over the counters has spices, mostly in jars.  Christmas 2019, I was making a gluten free, vegan cornbread for a relative, and I had the recipe on my phone, and my phone on the counter.  Glass spice jar meets glass phone face = not good.  I hate replacing things for stupid reasons, especially electronics.AppliancesWe have an upright freezer.  We actually had to purchase a larger model than we had originally, which meant that we had less space along that wall. Originally, we had the appliances pushed up against the cabinet, but refrigerators and freezers put off a lot of heat.  Yeah - that surprised me, too!  The result was that the inside of the cabinet ended up getting warmer than it should be.  So, we moved the refrigerator and freezer over, which meant there was this strange little gap in between the freezer and the pantry cabinet.At first, I wanted to custom build one of those pull-out shelves that look like a cabinet, except ... see air flow issue above.  A wooden \"cabinet\" would impede the air flow for the freezer.  So, I measured the gap, and to my great delight, it was the perfect size for a metal shelf, which I put on wheels, and now I have a pull out storage unit.   I, kind of, love it.  And it's perfect for all of my really big kettles, which I mostly use for canning.I'm reading this book - Housewifery - which was written in the early part of the 20th Century - 1904, I think.  It's fascinating.  The first chapter is about designing a house for maximum efficiency, and I'm pretty certain that the person who wrote that book would be appalled at my kitchen space.  Or, maybe, not. I've spent a lot of time reorganizing and adding cabinets, and deciding the best placement for my appliances, and really, making very conscious choices about the size and type of appliance.  Like, we don't have a microwave, and I have very few small appliances (like food processors or bread machines).  I just don't have the storage space for them, and so I make choices, and I do most stuff by hand, like chopping, which is done with a knife, not a food processor.  I took a lot of inspiration from looking through thousands of pictures of tiny houses, and while it's still not perfect, it works, for now.In the case of my kitchen, the joke \"Size doesn't matter.  It's what  you do with it,\" is completely accurate.  I've prepped dinner for 30+ people, hosted a Pampered Chef party for 10 in my tiny kitchen, and managed to feed my five children and my husband for the past 25 years.  I've also preserved all sorts of things in all sorts of ways including: fermenting, dehydrating, and canning.In fact, just yesterday, we canned 14 pints and 3 quarts of peaches (25 lbs), and while we were canning peaches, I also made a peach cobbler for dinner.   I have actually come to appreciate my tiny kitchen.  Everything is right within easy reach, which makes it highly efficient.  The only thing I would change about my kitchen is the sink.  I would like a deeper sink (or a taller faucet) for when I need to fill large pots.  And there is a small, narrow cabinet under the very small counter space on the right side of the sink.  If I had my way, I would replace that cabinet with drawers.Otherwise, it's a great space, and it is, truly, both literally and figuratively, the \"center\" of my home."},
{"title": "Money in the Bank", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2021", "text": "I got to thinking today, as I was loading up my clothesline outside, about my last post on the savings from washing and ironing the clothes myself.  In that post, I didn't add that I line dry all of our clothes and have been doing so for more than a decade.  This site gives a pretty good formula for determining how much it costs to run the clothes dryer.  Since I don't have a clothes dryer, I will use their $0.45 per load in my calculations of what I save by line drying my clothes.Maine has some form of precipitation on average 131 days per year with an estimated 192 days of sun.  If I estimate that I do laundry every sunny day (and I do laundry on nearly every sunny day), and also during the winter regardless of the weather, it works out to about five loads of laundry per week - which is accurate.  Sometimes, if I get the clothes in the washer early enough, I'll even have time for two loads in one day!At an average of 257 loads of laundry per year, the savings is $115/annually, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's $9/month and $2/week in savings.  If we're still using the $18/hour wage, it would require working a half hour per month just for the privilege of putting one's clothes in an electric clothes dryer.  It doesn't sound like much - it's just a half hour, right?  But every hour one works takes away from other things that most people would prefer to be doing, and certainly, most folks don't *want* to do laundry, but ....I actually find putting clothes on the line pretty meditative, and on beautiful, sunny days, like today, it's nice to be outside, in the warm sun, under that deep blue sky, hanging clothes on the line.  And I would much rather spend 15 minutes outside, putting clothes on the line, than stuck inside an office answering phones or checking my employer's email messages."},
{"title": "Domestics", "date": "Monday, September 6, 2021", "text": "Rumor has it that cats domesticated themselves,  and they have resisted all efforts from humans to hybridize them in the way we have hybridized dogs.  Word is that today's housecat is pretty much the same as its ancient ancestors - genetically speaking. This morning, after I ironed Deus Ex Machina's work clothes, my cat decided the ironing board was a good place to take a nap. I am brewing a post about domesticating myself.  Mostly it's about ironing, which, to me, is one of the most housewifish chores of all, and the one that was first to fall by the wayside when the title \"housewife\" became a pejorative, wives left the home for the workplace, and everyone believed that two incomes were necessary for a good life.  It's probably the least appreciated of all of our chores, but when calculating the dollars saved by having a housewife who does those chores, like ironing, there is a pretty significant savings over sending the ironing out to the laundry service.  I've discovered, much to my surprise, that I actually like ironing.  I invested in the cheapest ironing board I could find, and I'm still using an iron I purchased more than 20 years ago when I was enlisted in the US Army (and ironed my own uniforms, because I couldn't afford a laundry service, and being \"pressed and spit-shined\" was an unspoken requirement of a soldier who gave a shit).   I enjoy the simplicity of the task, and I enjoy the aesthetic of a freshly ironed pair of pants.  More, I guess, is that I enjoy seeing Deus Ex Machina wearing the clothes that I laundered for him.  It's a source of pride, for me, as his wife, to know that he's put-together when he goes to work.  Probably no one else in the world cares, but I do.  And it makes me happy to give him that silly, little thing.As for costs:The average cost for a laundry service to wash, dry, and fold one load of laundry is $7 - wash, dried, and folded (although not put away - I'll get to that).  Driving to the laundromat (at today's $3/gal) would cost him $1.50 just in gas money to deliver and pick up his laundry, and then, he would have to bring it home and put it away.  The cost to have a pair of pants ironed is $5, on average.  I iron Deus Ex Machina's pants every week so that he has a freshly ironed pair each work day - that's five pairs of pants, ironed, every week.  Since he only has four pairs of pants, he would need to have two loads of laundry washed per week.  It would cost him $14/week for washing.  The ironing would cost him $25 a week.  Gasoline to get back and forth to the laundry service would be $1.50 a week.  By doing his laundry and ironing his pants for him, I save $40.50 per week.   He works 47 out of 52 weeks per year.  By having me do his laundry and ironing, for free, here at home, I save him $1905.50 per year.  And as a bonus, I also put away his laundry, which wouldn't happen if he had a laundry service doing the dirty work.  As a side note, I also had to hem his work pants, because they were too long.  The cost to have a seamstress hem one pair of pants is $10.  There are four pairs.  I saved $40 by hemming them myself. The average wage earner would have to work 2.25 hours per week, just to pay for laundry services."},

{"title": "It's What's for Dinner", "date": "Friday, August 20, 2021", "text": "The other day my very good friend stopped by for some coffee and spoon carving.  We were chatting about life, and she lamented that, while she enjoys cooking, she does not enjoy having to decide what to cook every. single. night. I'm, mostly, okay with figuring out what's for dinner.  After two decades of being the head cook and bottle washer, it's just part of the rhythm of my day, and on those days when I'm feeling out of sync, Deus Ex Machina will order pizza ... erm ... make dinner (it's not always pizza ... sometimes it's Chinese food).  But ... eating out is expensive, especially when one has dietary restrictions - like no wheat, which is in EVERYTHING.  But also, I still have to decide what we're going to order, and then, there's the whole wait time and driving to pick it up.  Since we don't eat drive-thru sorts of food (see the gluten-free above - the only menu item in most fast-food joints that's GF is salad, and if I'm going to eat salad, I'll just make that here), it's more often than not faster (and more convenient, actually) to cook something here.  So, those pizza days are rare, which means I have usually decided what's for dinner by noon, and sometimes, depending on what I've decided to cook, I've already started cooking (like if I'm planning on slow-cooker pot roast, it will go on the crockpot first thing in the morning).Meal planning is often a topic of discussion for people in my circles and suggestions for making life easier for those of us who have to make that daily decision run the gamut from meal subscription services to cooking a whole week's worth of meals in a day and putting them in a special refrigerator or freezer.I have a friend who asked advice from her friends on social media regarding how to make answering that daily question What's for Dinner? easier, and one of her friends suggested the latter above - prepping on Sunday for lunches and dinners through the week.  She says it takes her all day, but it's worth the time and effort saved during the week.  She even posted a picture of her prepped meal refrigerator.  I was in awe!  The whole set-up was incredibly impressive.I am confident that I will never achieve that level of organization.When my children were younger, I attempted to do some version of meal planning - to save time and money.  One incarnation of our meal planning entailed writing out on a calendar what we would make for dinner each weekday and who would do the cooking (one of my many failed attempts to get my kids helping with meal prep).  A grocery list was compiled and grocery shopping ensued.  What we discovered is that we are (or maybe just *I* am) the kind of people who decide what we want to eat based on what we feel like eating that day.  So, the meal plan said \"baked pasta\" on Wednesday, but I didn't feel like baked pasta on that day.  It was the middle of August, and it had been a scorching hot day, and there was no way that I was going to heat up the house to bake pasta.  I didn't even want to boil water inside.  I'm pretty sure we ended up making a special trip to the farm stand that day and picking up corn and watermelon.  The corn was cooked on the grill, along with some hamburg patties.I'm also pretty sure that the alt-meal wasn't even one we had considered when we made our plan.But that's the thing I always wonder when I hear about people who make meal plans and prepare a week's worth of meals in advance.  How are they gonna know on Sunday, what they're going to want to eat on Wednesday?Suffice it to say that I am a meal-prep failure.  But I am a very good, figure-it-out-spur-of-the-moment kind of cook.  I was 10 when the television show Three's Company debuted, and every time I cook eggs, I think of Jack Tripper, that first morning, when Chrissy Snow and Janet Wood found him sleeping in their bathtub, and the topic of roommates came up.  He needed a place to live.  They needed a roommate, but the lynchpin to his being invited to stay was that he could cook.  He made breakfast for them using leftover ingredients from the going away party for their previous roommate and a few things from the refrigerator.  I was always impressed with Jack's innovation in the kitchen.And I guess that's the way I decided I was going to cook, because there have been many times in my life, when a very limited grocery budget, WIC subsidies, and food gifts (like frozen raspberries from my grandma) meant that I needed to be creative in the kitchen.  In fact, when I was a poor, married-with-children college student, a glut of eggs from the WIC program prompted me to learn how to make quiche.  Quickest, easiest, fancy food ever! Not meal planning has actually resulted in some interesting meal components.  The other night, I made hamburger patties, but we didn't have any buns or any bread of any kind, and so I cooked the patties with onions and barbecue sauce to make them more like a steak, and less like hamburgers.  It's not something that I have ever had anyone else cook for me, in that way.  Neither is it something that I've seen a recipe for, and so I'm pretty certain that if I were someone who meal prepped and/or planned ahead of time, that particular meal component would never have been part of my diet. Thing is, when I am purchasing food, I don't think in terms of meals.  I think in terms of ingredients.  What things do we need so that I can put it all together, like a tasty puzzle, and make a meal.  Most of our meals are pretty simple and contain some stable ingredients. When I get ready to make dinner, it will have certain components.  Usually, some kind of meat, like hamburg.  I will often have a starch, like potatoes, pasta, or rice.  There will be some sort of vegetable, usually something green, like lettuce for a salad, or cabbage made into coleslaw.  Last night I made fried rice with a 1/2 lb of sandwich steak cut into tiny pieces, eggs from our chickens, broccoli from my garden, onions, and some leftover rice.  I am getting low on Tamari (which is gluten-free soy sauce), which I usually add to my fried rice, and so, instead, I added curry powder for flavoring.  I also add sesame oil.  Sometimes I add fresh grated ginger or other vegetables.  Tonight we're having the above mentioned barbecue burgers with the bread I made this afternoon and coleslaw using cabbage from the garden.  I will add some pickled jalapenos I made the other day to the coleslaw to give it a little zing.  I also make all of my own dressings and sauces (usually a mayonnaise based dressing), which means, I will almost always have on hand: mayonnaise (and I hope to report soon that I'm making my own with our glut of eggs), an assortment of vinegars, milk or half-and-half, and all sorts of herbs and spices.I can make a really good ranch-style \"house\" dressing that just tastes good on almost anything.  Tweaking the herbs makes that house dressing into a creamy Italian dressing, and my coleslaw dressing is good enough to eat with a spoon on some crackers.  For me, having the ingredients to cook just about anything we're craving has been the best solution for \"meal prep\" and planning.  It means a little more daily planning, because I need to start figuring out what's for dinner in the morning to be sure that I have thawed meat, but it's easier, for me, to plan a little each day rather than spend an entire day cooking, or spend a half a day writing out what I plan to cook in five days, only to discover that no wants baked pasta when it's almost hot enough in the kitchen to cook without the oven, but turning on the oven would put the house in the hot-as-the-bowels-of-Hell region. How do you meal prep?  Be

{"title": "Housewives are the Original DIYers", "date": "Friday, August 6, 2021", "text": "My family moved eight times in my first eight years of life.   It wasn't a big deal, because everyone I knew did the same.  We were all Army brats.   It wasn't until I was 10 that I realized that some people never move, and, for them, there is a place that they call \"home\" - a place where they have grown, a place that they leave (sometimes), and (often) a place they go back to ... a place they belong.As an Army brat, I didn't have that kind of home.  I had a different place that was a \"home\" to me.  My dad's childhood was very different.  He lived nearly his entire childhood in the same little house in the same little community, where his parents and several of his siblings, many of his aunts and uncles and cousins still lived.  In fact, still do.  His father built the house my dad grew up in when my dad wasn't much more than a toddler.  The closest place in the world I had to a hometown was that old homestead where my dad was raised.  It wasn't the whole community to whom I connected, but rather just that deep mountain hollow, a few of the neighbors, that house on the hill (my Granny's house), and those many people who lived there.  They were my family.  That was my home.  It was the one place I always felt like I really belonged.  From the time I was around eight until I turned fourteen and my dad retired, my family would make the nine-hour drive from where we lived in the deep south to that little homestead in the Appalachian mountains.  Spending time on my grandma's farm with all of the animals and my cousins, who just lived up the road, was an idyllic summer for this suburban kid.  It was about as quintessentially down-home as it could get.  They had a television set, but didn't have cable TV, because there was no cable TV service back in the hollow.  Neither was there much with regard to television reception, and Hee Haw was viewed through a veil of snow. I couldn't even see it to say who was heeing, and who was hawing.  In short, we had to find (and usually did) other ways to entertain ourselves.Summers in the mountains were warm, not the face-melting hot of central Alabama, but warm enough that by the end of the day, especially after Granny had heated up the house cooking dinner for the many of us, inside was the last place anyone wanted to be, and most evenings, after dinner was eaten, and the farm had been tended, most of the adult males could be found outside on the front porch, in the cool of the evening, chewing tobacco, whittling a stick, and telling a tale.  Honestly, better than TV - not that I had much choice.  See above.Today I spent a lot of time thinking about those nights, sitting on the porch and watching my grandpa and uncles whittling a stick.  I don't recall anything, in particular, that was ever carved out of those wooden sticks.  Mostly, I just think the whittling was a meditation, or just something to keep their hands busy so that they could justify the sittin' a spell and spinnin' a yarn.  As the saying goes, \"Idle hands are the devil's playthings.\"I was channeling those ancestors of mine today - although my whittling was a bit more practical than therapeutic.  I've been planning this project using wooden spoons for a couple of weeks.  I told Deus Ex Machina about it, and I also told him that I thought I wanted to carve my own spoons rather than purchase them.  I know.  Wooden spoons are cheap.  We can get them 3/$1 at the Dollar Store, but this is a very special project, and to me, it felt more right to have this hand-made piece rather than something that was carved in a factory, probably by a machine that is operated by someone who works very hard to churn out these millions of spoons that will be sold for pennies.  I felt like my project needed a more personal touch.This past weekend, while we were splitting firewood, Deus Ex Machina split a birch log into some spoon blanks for me.  Today was sunny and beautiful with a lovely breeze.  I could smell the ocean.  I grabbed my Mora knife, went out in the shaded front yard, and started shaping one of those blanks.  It could only have been better if I actually had a front porch.I thought a lot about my grandpa and my uncles sitting out on that porch and telling stories while they whittled.  I can't remember any of their stories, but I do remember their voices, and their postures, and the comfortable way they carved a big stick into a little toothpick.I found the process quite relaxing, and I knew, probably for the first time, why.  Why they would sit for hours into the dying day and just shave those slivers of wood off the larger piece.  Thoughtfully.  Meditatively.  They had no where to go, and that stick wasn't gonna whittle itself.  At the end of the day, I have a very lovely wooden spoon, and I am happy with the result.  The fact that it actually LOOKS like spoon is pretty cool, to me.  I just need to sand it a little, and maybe use a fancier carving tool than a Mora knife to hollow out a bowl for the spoon.  It's pretty perfect for the project I'm working on.And I am thrilled that I can now add spoon-carving to that growing list of skills I have, and ... you know ... I think I might start making all of my wood spoons. Spending a couple of dollars on a few spoons isn't going to break us financially, but knowing how to do something, how to create a thing, and actually being able to do it ... for free! ... is the one of the most empowering feelings in the world.  That I can make my own stuff is incredibly satisfying - especially from a self-sufficiency/survival point of view.  And bonus, if I ever get lost out in the woods, and I have a knife (and maybe an ax), I can make a spoon with which to eat all of that foraged food I will be harvesting.***********************************Last week, we ordered some pork from a local farmer.  What I asked for was a couple of packages of Italian sausage, a couple of packages of garlic sausage, and several packages of breakfast sausage.  There's a theme here - we like sausage.  Not just charcuterie, but seasoned ground meat.  It's a very small, family-run farm.  We have to pre-order the pork via FB messenger.  Then, they package it up for us, and we drive to their farm (it's not close) with cash in hand, and pay when we pick up the meat.  So, we drove out, paid the farmer, grabbed our bag of pork, and came back home.  There didn't seem to be any reason to check the order at the farm.  I mean, it was typed out ... on FB messenger.When I got home, we had Italian sausage and garlic sausage, but what was supposed to have been breakfast sausage was unseasoned ground pork.It's the same price, and so I couldn't really be angry, except that I didn't want ground pork.  A few days earlier, we had picked up our cow-share, and so we had plenty of ground meat (beef) in the freezer.  I don't need ground meat.  I need sausage.So, I found a seasoning recipe for sausage in the Google cookbook, and I just mixed up my own.  It's delicious!And next time I order pork from that farm, I'll probably just ask for ground, unseasoned, and season it myself.Also, BONUS:  the recipe calls for a couple of herbs that I have growing in my garden - sage and thyme.  So, I was able to add fresh herbs, from my garden, to the mix.  Herbs are expensive, and so growing and using my own saves us a lot of money.  Plus, there's the whole, empowerment and self-sufficiency aspect.  After I mixed the seasoning really well, I cooked up a couple of patties.  It's delicious."},

{"title": "How to be a Frugal Carnivore", "date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2021", "text": "Thirteen years ago, I dragged Deus Ex Machina (and our daughters) kicking and screaming down the Locavore path.  Finding local produce, especially during the summer, proved pretty easy.  We have always had a garden, and so we are able to provide some food for ourselves, but not everything we wanted.  Much to our delight, we discovered, even back in those days, before eating local was what everyone does, there was a thriving local farming community.  We had a Farmer's Market, a smattering of PYO farms for fruit and berries, and farm stands were, and still are, on every corner from late June until early October.  We could get all of the corn, potatoes, cabbage, strawberries, blueberries, and apples we could carry.  We also found seafood (mostly lobster), and a couple of sources of local milk and cheese.  The local dairies also, occasionally, had beef, but it seemed like prices per pound were a lot higher than we were paying at the grocery store. Which was fine.  We adjusted.  I got creative.  We still ate meat at nearly every meal, but the portion sizes got much smaller, and there's no such thing as waste.  Every bit is used, and yes, we do leftovers.  Once we were well and good on the locavore path, we started looking for ways to stretch our growing season so that we could have that locally produced food year round.  We have learned many ways to preserve the harvest.  My favorite way to preserve vegetables (and eggs) is through pickling/fermenting.  I learned how to can everything from strawberry jam to chicken meat and broth.  We have a dehydrator and know how to use it!  We also started looking for bulk purchases.  Finding a local place to purchase 50 lbs of potatoes all at once was a happy discovery.  And, then, we discovered cow-shares and pig-shares.  Basically, we hire a local farmer to raise an animal for us.  It takes pre-planning, because we have to agree to the share well in advance of receiving the meat, and we don't know how much we'll get.  Sometimes we don't get anything, like the time we ordered a turkey, but all of the birds succumbed to black-head disease.  We had lobster for Thanksgiving dinner that year.  Buying a meat-share is a form of Community Supported Agriculture - we give the farmer a down payment to raise the animal, and then, when the animal reaches butchering age, we pay a price per pound of hanging weight.  And we pay the butchering fees.The butcher that most of my meat-share farmers use is the same butcher we have always used for our chickens.  After almost thirteen years of seeing me every summer, they know my name, which is kind of cool.  They also know that I am a good, solid customer, and the result is that if I say, \"Hey, if you hear of anyone who has an extra ____share they'd like to sell,\" I will get a call and be able to stock my freezer.  This past week, I was out at the butchers a couple of times.  Last week, I picked up our cow-share, and a couple of days later, I dropped off and picked up our chickens.  Their facility is a few miles from me down some beautiful, windy, country roads with more trees than traffic.  I dislike driving during the summer here in my tourist-y area, because there are just too many cars on the road being driven by too many people who are here on vacation - with all of the entitled attitude that brings, but this drive - being off the tourist path - is kind of nice.As I was meandering under cool shade of the tree-lined blacktop, I started thinking about the beef and chicken, which started me thinking about the cost.  Above I mention that we had grown accustomed to paying more, but when my mind started wandering and those numbers started adding up, I realized that we are, actually, paying less.Pound for PoundTo get an idea of what other people pay for \"locally raised, sustainably grown\" beef, I found this local butcher shop.   The butcher I mention as \"my butcher\" above is not a shop, but a service.  They do not sell meat.  They process the live animal, which I (or my farmer friend) provide, and I am purchasing their service.  For a chicken, the cost per pound will depend on the size of my chicken.  The larger the bird, obviously, the more cost savings, for me.   On average, our chickens weigh 6lbs, fully dressed out.  When I have my chickens butchered, I get a whole, frozen bird.  I also get the hearts, livers, and necks (for soup).  Everything included (chicks, feed, and butchering), I pay about $1.50 per pound for the whole chicken.  The above linked butcher shop sells whole chickens for $2.99/lb.  The cost for chicken portions, like legs and wings, varies.  The breast meat is $9.99/lb.   We're not, necessarily, talking apples to apples, because my birds are raised, by me, in my backyard.  I know where they've been and what they've done.  I know they haven't been given antibiotics or other questionable pharmaceuticals just to keep them alive long enough to reach butchering age.  They spend time outside walking around in the yard, eating grass, and catching bugs, and drinking from the garden hose.But for a cost analysis, this shop is about as close to what I have in my freezer as I'm going to get.  A six pound chicken at this shop is $17.94.  I save  $8.49, per bird, by raising my own.  We raised 27 birds this year.  Over the course of the year, by raising my own, I have saved my family $229.23.  What I've found is that sourcing local beef has the same sort of cost savings, just in pounds per meat.  We just purchased a quarter cow.  Our portion was 180 lbs, and it worked out to around $6/lb.  Most of it is ground beef, which means, yes, I paid $6/lb for ground beef, which seemed like a lot, but the butcher shop linked above advertises their 80/20 beef at $6.99/lb.  I don't know what the ratio of beef to fat is in the ground beef in my freezer, but what I do know is that it is so lean that I need to add olive oil to keep it from sticking to the pan, and I NEVER have to drain the grease off my taco meat, because there is none.But that's not it.  I paid $6/lb for beef:  ground beef, tenderloin, T-bone steak, filet mignon, sandwich steaks, stew meat, rump roast, chuck roast ....  All cuts, from the lowliest of the low to the high brow choices, are $6/lb.I averaged the price per pound for the different cuts of meat at that butcher shop above, and the average (adding up all of the prices per pound for the different cuts they offer that are also in my freezer) cost per pound is $18.18.  So, if we use that number and say that I was going to buy all of the same cuts that I have in my freezer, 180 lbs of meat at that butcher shop would cost $3240.  Including butchering fees, I saved over $2000 by purchasing a cow share. Just by raising our own chickens and by purchasing a cow share, I have saved my family $2229.23 per year. But that's not all.  We save in cost per pound for the meat, but that's not where the savings ends.Shopping HabitsBuying in bulk, like a quarter of a cow at a time, and raising our own allows me to spend less time in the grocery store.  This past year, I also started purchasing online and in bulk, which means visits to the store are even fewer.  I haven't been to the big grocery store in months.  I have visited a locally owned, small boutique grocery store and the small, locally owned town grocery store (mostly catering to tourists, but there are regular groceries there, too) a few times per month over the past year. According to this article, consumers spend an average of $5400 per year on impluse buys, and 70% of respondents list food as their biggest impulse.  I don't know that we are, exactly, average.  I do know that we spent a lot of money on groceries, when I had to shop in store, and I was going to the store every week.  Sometimes more often, because we \"forgot\" something, or we wanted a meal for which I didn't have all of the ingredients, or we wanted some quick food (which I don't normally purchase), and we were just going to run in and get some frozen pizza.  The \"how's that working for ya?\" question is a good one right here.  How that worked, for us, was that we would spend less money eating out, but we spent a LOT on groceries, and even more, because every single time we stepped into that grocery store, there was the potential, and usually the inevitability, that we would spend more than we had intended.  A trip for a couple of $9 pizzas could end up costing $80, on top of the $250 to $300 from the previous \"weekly\" shopping trip.Buying meat in bulk from a local producer means that I can purchase non-perishables, pet food, and toiletries (like toilet paper) in bulk online, and I can get all of our produce at the farm stand, which means what I need from a grocery store is pretty much, nothing.  If I allow for a quarter of the \"impulse\" buying, because I'm spending only a quarter of the time in the store, I have saved my family $2362.50 so far this year by limiting my visits to the grocery store.  At the end of the year, our savings - if we did, indeed spend the average - will be $4050.In short, between the cost-per-pound savings and the limited impulse buys, we are saving $6250/year.  The average hourly worker in Maine earns $18/hour.  That works out to 347 hours or over 8 weeks worth of full time work to earn the equivalent of what we save annually by purchasing in bulk, raising our own, and limiting our shopping trips/impulse purchases.  Wow!  Who knew being a carnivore could be frugal?**And also, since all of our meat is locally sourced, we are eating more sustainably and eco-friendly than the average American."},
{"title": "Cleaning Up", "date": "Wednesday, July 21, 2021", "text": "I have some very talented and creative friends.  One of my friends has been making soap.  She has become very passionate about it and very good at it.  In fact, she has become such a talented soap-maker that she no longer buys soap.  My favorite of her recent soap-making related quips was to quote her son, who lamented the fact that his mom no longer buys \"normal\" soap.  Hers is better.  So, why spend the money?  I will admit my admiration of her.  She's pretty amazing, actually.She learned to make both a bar and a liquid soap, and even better than just keeping her family washed, the liquid soap can also be used for the dishes and the laundry.I have made my own soap using lye and lard (I included a recipe in my book, Surviving the Apocalypse in the Suburbs: the Thrivalist's Guide to Life Without Oil*), but I never learned to make it into a liquid for laundry and dishes.  I guess I knew that my soap could be used for whatever (grated bar soap can be dissolved in water and mixed with borax and washing powder for liquid laundry soap), but it just never occurred to me to take it beyond washing my body.  Soap can be expensive, and while there are definitely cheaper options than the one we use, as I've aged, I have developed some pretty significant sensitivities.  If I don't want to end up an itchy mess, I have to be very careful about what I smear on my skin.  For personal hygiene, I have been buying Dr. Bonner's bar soap through their website.  I buy 10 bars at a time at a cost of about $5.05/bar including shipping.  It takes a week and a half to get here.  Buying it locally doesn't save me much more.  The bars are around $4 each at places like Rite Aid, but I can't always get the flavor I want.  Since Dr. Bonner's isn't a brand that flies off the shelves, most places have a very limited selection of scents and only stock the most popular scents.  I can almost always find peppermint.  I almost never find almond, which is my favorite, especially during the winter. We use about five bars of soap per month for four people, two of whom use it full-body, including hair.  It works out to about $26.45/month for soap (buying it online). My friend is also making the liquid soap, which can be used like the Dr. Bonner's concentrated liquid.  According to their website, \"Dr. Bronner’s 18-in-1 Pure-Castile Soaps are good for just about any cleaning task. Face, body, hair & dishes, laundry, mopping, pets\" - basically everywhere in the house.  And it's diluted for most uses, which means a 32 oz bottle should last a while.  Thirty-two ounces of Dr. Bonner's concentrated liquid soap is $18.49 from their website (not including shipping).  It's about the same at the grocery store. I have never used Dr. Bonner's exclusively for the above listed tasks, because it's expensive, compared to other cleaners, even diluted.  According to this dilution cheat sheet on the Dr. Bonner's website, one would use 1/2c of Dr. Bonner's per load of laundry, which works out to eight loads of laundry per 32 oz bottle.  I mean, that doesn't sound right, to me, and, at over $18/bottle, it certainly isn't cost effective as a laundry soap, if those figures are accurate.  I reckoned that making my own soap could save us some pretty pennies.  So, I asked my friend to teach me to make her soap.  She was delighted to help me, and we set a date.She stopped by for a few hours the other day with some soap making supplies: a whisk, a dedicated plastic container for mixing lye, some potassium hydroxide (a.k.a. potash (KOH) for making liquid soap), and some molds for the bar soap.  I had purchased coconut oil and lye (Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH), and I always have a good supply of essential oils, which are optional and can be omitted, if the soap maker prefers.The process was so simple.  Basically, melt the coconut.  CAREFULLY, mix the lye or potash with water (it gets hot, so great caution is necessary!).  Blend the two, and stir, and stir, and stir ....After much stirring (my friend uses a stand mixer, which she sets and leaves so that she can do other stuff while the soap is processing), the liquid soap compound takes the consistency of marshmallow fluff.  It is, then, transferred to a container (I reused a polypropylene container that had originally been used for mixed nuts) and sequestered (my friend's word, which she said means just putting it out of the way for a bit).  Overnight, the mixture thickens from a fluff consistency to a mashed potato consistency, and according to my friend, it's done!My friend advised diluting 3:1 (water/soap) for a liquid soap that can be used for whatever purpose.  If wanted, essential oils are added at this last stage, just before use.  It actually smells like soap - clean and fresh.  I think I like it without any essential oils, just the way it is.  The bar soap was pretty much the same steps.  Melt the coconut oil.  Mix the lye with water (again, carefully, because it does get hot).  Allow to cool.  Mix lye water with coconut oil and stir.  When it thickens to the consistency of pancake batter, add essential oils and pour into molds.  We used a silicone bunny-shaped mold, and I was able to remove the soap from the mold the next morning.  It will have to \"cure\" for another two weeks or so before we use it. The recipe my friend used measures in grams.  I used a handy-dandy internet converter.  It's, basically, 30 oz (840g) of coconut oil (I found 15 oz bottles of coconut oil for $3 each at the dollar store); 1/4lb (114g) of lye (Amazon lists a pound container for lye for $11.99); and 234g of water (about 0.99 cups).The bar soap recipe makes around 12 standard-sized bars, which (excluding the cost of the essential oils), works out to $0.75/bar.By teaching me to make this soap, my friend has saved us around $255/year on bar soap.I won't know how much she saved us on laundry and dish soap until I get a good sense of how quickly we go through that container, but every little bit helps, right?Being a real housewife is not a TV drama.  It's also not \"just\" about doing laundry and making dinner.  We, \"Real\" Housewives, are economists, whose the goal is finding ways to be financial savvy in our home care.  Where I live the average hourly wage earner makes $18/hour.  One has to work for 20 minutes to buy one bar of Dr. Bonner's soap.  That's a third of an hour, just to buy a single bar of soap.  While it is true that I spent more than 20 minutes making my soap, I was also able to do other tasks while the soap was setting up (i.e. it doesn't require 100% of my attention for the whole process).  After measuring and mixing the ingredients, for instance, I could take a couple of minutes to put the clothes on the line, or go out in the garden and harvest cabbage for dinner, or go out in the farmyard and collect eggs.  All of those tasks also save us money.  Contrary to what some may believe, Housewifery** is an incredibly skill-based \"profession\", and like so many industries that are hurting for skilled and talented workers, there are very few of us left who are knowledgeable in the true art of keeping a house.  When we lose our homemakers, we will all be dependent on other people to do the task of taking care of us, which means longer work hours and, ultimately, a lower quality of life.The further we, as a society, get from being able to do such simple things as making soap, the more time we will spend trying to make money to compensate for our lack of skill.  ========================================*This is not an affiliate link, but if you purchase a new copy of this book from the publisher's link, I do receive a residual.  **This is NOT an affiliate link.

{"title": "Face Masks and Rice Packs", "date": "Monday, July 5, 2021", "text": "Deus Ex Machina works at a corporate job in a manufacturing facility.  His employer is still requiring face masks.At the beginning of the Pandemic, I made a bunch of masks for my family.  As the pandemic wore on, I made a few more to cut down on having to launder them as often.  Over the course of the last year, I have made just over a half dozen different masks for Deus Ex Machina to use at work.    He has been wearing those masks, one a day, every day, five days a week, for more than a year.  The masks are holding up surprisingly well, given how much they are used, but recently, we learned that his employer does not have a plan for going full mask-free, and so, I made him a few new ones today, with a very summery vibe - one for each day of the week.  These are all reversible (two of them have the same color fabric on both sides) and are made from a quilter's weight cotton fabric - breathable, but with a tight enough weave to keep out virus particles - as was recommended last year when everyone was making homemade masks.Since I have a sizeable fabric stash (much of which was given to me by a dear friend who is no longer quilting), and I save elastic from everything, I didn't need to purchase anything to make these.If Deus Ex Machina had been purchasing masks, he would have paid, for a comparable product, $4 each.  Today's five masks would have cost $20.  I made them, excluding my time and the electricity for my sewing machine, for free. Over the year of making all of these masks, I have cut out extra mask panels on a few occasions, and so I had several fabric rectangles in my stash.  I was looking at them today, thinking, I should sew them all together.  I would have the beginnings of a quilt.Then, I walked into the kitchen to get another cup of coffee.  Many years ago, we bought a set of lavender infused rice packs, which we store in the freezer.  When the girls were young the rice packs were dubbed, \"Cold Things.\"  Every bump or bruise called for the getting a \"cold thing\" from the freezer.  In our house, they're better than band aids for curing what ails you.   And we use them for everything from keeping cool on those wicked hot summer nights when it's hard to sleep in our non-air conditioned home and the fans just aren't doing it to a cold compress o his forehead when Deus Ex Machina has one of his migraines.  Suffice it to say that our \"cold things\" were well used, and as a result, over the years they've gotten a little ragged.  One of them even developed a hole, which someone tried to stitch closed.  It still lost a few pieces of rice with every use.  Also, recently, I noticed that several of them had something sticky on them, probably from something that leaked on them in the freezer.  I hate touching sticky stuff.  But I was at a loss as to how to clean them without compromising the rice that was in the pack.  I mean, I couldn't just throw them in the washer. I was planning to replace the old fabric ... at some point.This morning, after I made Deus Ex Machina's new summer masks, I walked in the kitchen for some coffee, and there, on the counter, was one of the sticky cold things.  So, I grabbed it and brought it out to the table where I had my sewing machine set up.  I, quickly, sewed four mask panels together, cut open the old cold thing, and transferred the contents into the new cover.  I also added a handful of dried lavender flowers we just happened to have in the cupboard - leftover from some salve or soap project were were doing in the past.All total, I made three new rice packs using leftover fabric from my mask making, rice from the old cold things, and a handful of dried lavender leftover from some other project.Out or curiosity, I looked up the cost of a new lavender infused rice pack.  I found these for $19.99 ... EACH.  Today, I saved $79.97 for the rice packs and masks that we didn't have to purchase."},
{"title": "How a non-wage earning Housewife MAKES More Than a Minimum Wage Worker", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2021", "text": "We have this great family story.When Big Little Sister was three or four years old, Deus ExMachina worked for a company that made the equipment used by the CDmanufacturing industry to put the shiny metal on the discs.  Itwas a fascinating process, and the machines were pretty cool looking,too.He was, rightfully, very proud of his work in assisting with theengineering of this machine, and so he brought us into the facilityfor a tour so that we could see it in action.  It wasimpressive.A few days later, out of curiosity and to see if Big Little Sisterunderstood what he did for a living, he asked her, \"Do you knowwhat Daddy makes at work?\" Without skipping a beat, she blurted, \"Money.\"I think about that ... a lot ... because money is something that Idon't make a lot of, and sometimes I feel the weight of a societythat doesn't value people who don't earn a wage.  I've heard it in exactly those terms from more than one person, who intimated that my value - or lack thereof - was connected to whatever I could make in dollars.  I make very few dollars, and so I am not worth all that much, to our society, according to those people.The fact is,though, that I make a lot of stuff, like:this lunch bag (which are going for $6.50 on Etsy);  these masks (compare to these @ 3 for $12);clothes, using recycled/upcycled clothes and my own patterns (5 pack of men's boxer briefs = $34; women's knee-length A-line skirt = $17.97; skirt pattern $9.65);  breakfast every morning (gluten-free bagel with organic, cage-free eggs and provolone cheese = $9) and dozens of other things I do and make on a daily basis.Just those things listed is $73.12 worth of goods.  The minimum wage in Portland, Maine is $15/hour.  Someone working for minimum wage would have to work almost five hours in order to pay for those items I make.  In the doing of those things, in the \"making\",I SAVE money.  If we subtract the cost of the breakfast sandwich, I saved $54,47, because I didn't pay for the materials to make any of those items.  It was all recycled.It got me thinking.  The fact is, my being a full-time housewife saves a lot of money (overall), because I can do things, make things, sew things, iron things, plant things, grow things, clean things, cook things ... that we would, otherwise, have to pay someone else to do.The average annual income for an hourly worker here in Maine is $39,327.   Assuming that's full-time, the average hourly rate in Maine is $18.90.  When I was working outside the home at a local community theater, I earned less per hour.  My job as a fact-checker pays more per hour, but I don't and won't get as many hours as I worked at the theater.  So, there will be less money.But if I am home more, then, we save more, because I can do all of those things that we might end up paying someone else to do, and there are no job-related expenses (like gasoline for the car I needed to travel back and forth to work, which I don't need for that purpose now, because I don't have to drive to work).  Today, I made Deus Ex Machina a breakfast sandwich ($9), packed his lunch ($7.50), did some housework ($40/hour), and ironed work clothes ($3/pants; $1.50/shirt).  The total \"saved\" today was $61.  A person making the average hourly rate here in Maine would have had to work three hours and 22 minutes to pay someone to do what I did today. Oh wait!  I also did some sewing ...... but that will be another blog post.I challenge you to calculate how many hours you must work to pay for some basic products and services.   Then, consider if your job costs more than you could save, by doing those things yourself and not earning a wage."},
{"title": "Fact Checking for the Win", "date": "Wednesday, May 12, 2021", "text": "After the flurry of morning activity had died down, Deus Ex Machina was out the door with his belly full of homemade breakfast sandwich (with eggs from our backyard flock and a slice of ham from a Maine-based producer), a cup of home-brewed coffee-to-go, and his lunch packed neatly in his new lunch bag, I sat down for a couple of minutes of coffee and relaxation before I had to start part II of my morning flurry (tending the farm, showering, and ferrying Precious over to her friend's house).  I have been on the Internet and on social media since its inception.  Back in the early days of human-to-human *computer-interfaced* interaction (what today's folks would call Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.), we had email and message boards.  I learned a lot in those days about how not-to act and react with people online.  It was a lot more anonymous back in those days, and so we could be a little less tactful, and many of us were.  I tried, in those days, to be very aware that on the other side of those printed words on the computer display, the moniker \"H2OColor\" was an actual person and not some faceless screen with disembodied hands typing on a keyboard and refuting my comments.But what I also learned was to be very careful about what I put out there.  If I make assertions, I fact-check those comments to the extent possible, using as many resources as I can find.  I have been caught too may times with my proverbial pants down, by posting something that wasn't, necessarily, entirely, true.  The other day Deus Ex Machina gave me a very high compliment.  He told me that I am a very intelligent person who is inclined to do a lot of research into topics, to be sure that I understand EXACTLY what the issue is.  It's true.  I am fascinated by stuff, but moreover, I just don't like to have someone challenge what I've said.  If I say it, especially emphatically, chances are very good that I've spent some time looking it up.So, this morning, after Deus Ex Machina left with a full belly and a cuppa-to-go, I sat down and scrolled through Linked In, one of the more \"professional\" social media platforms.  I found an article entitled \"25 Random Trivia Facts for Springtime\", which was actually published by a company to which I had applied for a job as a trivia writer.  I mean, who doesn't love trivia?  And as someone who, at one time, had a brain-full of trivial information (like, I could name all of Charlie's Angels, and the actresses who played them), I figured I was shoo-in.  I was passed over for the job, but I am still connected to the company via Linked In.The article caught my eye (there was a pretty picture of bright yellow flowers), and so I clicked on it and started scrolling.  My favorite fact was #13: \"Guinness was first brewed in 1759.  It's older than the United States.\" That was interesting, and I was thinking, as I continued to scroll and read, that I was going to share the article.  Then, I got to #19: \"Lisa Kudrow is the oldest of the main 'Friends' cast members.  She was born in 1983.\"  I paused.  1983?  And I tried to do some quick math.  My son was born in the 1980s.  Wait?  Lisa Kudrow is young enough to be my kid?  No effing way!So, I looked it up.  A 10 second \"fact check\" (and I have a SLOW internet connection).  Not only is Lisa Kudrow NOT young enough to be my kid, she's actually older than I am.  Of the original cast members, only three are younger than I am - Matt Leblanc by only a few months, and Jennifer Aniston and Matthew Perry by two years.  In fact, the \"Friends\" could have been my friends.I stopped reading at #19. Their \"fun facts\", while subjectively fun, were not facts.  Deus Ex Machina and I have been watching Designated Survivor on Netflix (I mean, it's Keifer Sutherland, another of those 1980s/90s heart-throbs who could have been my friend had the stars aligned differently).  Sutherland plays a reluctant US President, and his entire advancement to that esteemed office is shadowed by some controversy or other.  My favorite character is Seth - who is the White House Press Secretary.  What's frustrating is to see the, potentially very real, way that the press, the very folks who should be seeking actual facts and truth - BEFORE they release that information to the public - will run with a half story.It's also disheartening to watch them \"spin\" a story.  And what's the most frustrating aspect is that I know that the show is fiction, but what they are depicting is just too very real.The news media is not interested in telling the facts.  Nor are they particularly motivated to print truths.  What they want are stories.  It's very easy to get caught up in the news and in the media frenzy.  It's easy to fall prey to believing that every thing they say has been thoroughly vetted.But like #19 in the Trivia Hub's \"Fun Facts for Spring\", sometimes things that aren't true at all are presented as if they are carved-in-stone facts.   It becomes very difficult to determine what's real and what's someone's oversight or pure imagination.Next time you see a report that seems very sensational, my challenge, to you, is to stop for one second, take a very deep, Yoga breath, and dig deeper.  I had a conversation with my son-in-law the other day, following the cyberattack on the pipeline.  He'd posted a meme, and it was funny.  It said, essentially, \"When a panic about a shortage, causes a shortage.\"  It happened with toilet paper and canned goods last year, when we were informed, by the news media, that there were shortages on food and toilet paper.  The implication of his meme is that it's happening with gasoline right now.  The question is, IS it REALLY happening, or are the piranha, who call themselves journalists, giving us the information that they think we *want * to know?My comment to my SIL's meme was \"This is exactly why I am a prepper.\"  He replied, in effect, \"Sure, but it's hard to stockpile gasoline.\"  To which I stated, \"Prepping isn't just about stocking up.   It's really about planning and finding alternatives.\"And, it's all connected, I swear - the fact checking and the prepping are all a part of how I navigate my world.  And both of those things - dispelling the worry over things I can't control by looking shit up and taking charge of the things that I can control - empower me, and take away that fear that somehow I am in danger.I don't live in fear.  I live in action.  And Lisa Kudrow is not young enough to be my kid, but Guinness Beer is old enough to be the daddy of the United States."},
{"title": "Five Foraged Foods You Probably Have in Your Backyard:  Adventures in learning NOT to Starve on Sundays", "date": "Tuesday, May 11, 2021", "text": "OnMemorial Day several years ago, Deus Ex Machina decided that every Sundayuntil Labor Day he was going to eat only what he could forage, andbecause I am a very supportive wife, an avid locavore and a lover offood challenges, I agreed to join him.Unfortunately,we have very busy lives.  Deus Ex Machina has always had a full-time,outside-the-home job, and I have always worked part-time from home.  In addition,we were  homeschooling at the time, and even though it was summer, our daughters werestill very busy with lessons and activities that do not follow aschool-year schedule. Complicate the issue by adding our extensivelist of volunteer activities, and what you have is not a lot of timeleft to forage.Wehave read that the average hunter/gatherer spent three hours per dayprocuring food, which seemed easy enough.  Three hours a day does notseem like that much time, until one is faced with a very busy modernlife.   Unfortunately, unlike the typical hunter/gatherer we werealso limited by laws that prohibit hunting certain animals in certainareas at certain times of the year, which means that our food optionswere that much more narrowed, often to just what we could gather.ForagingSundays turned into an interesting project.   Ideally, we would havebeen able to find time to get out during the week for food that wecould enjoy on Sunday, but that was not always what happened.  Ourdaughters called it Starving Sundays, and while we did not, ever,come close to starving, there was more than one Sunday morning whenwe hauled ourselves out of bed wondering what, and if, we would beeating that day.Asluck would have it, we had a few stand-bys that we were able to counton eating – no matter what else we found.  These were plants thatwere growing very close to home, many of them in our yard.  Mostpeople would consider them weeds and work very hard to eradicatethem.  On more than one Sunday over our summer of foraging, we becameincredibly thankful for them, and even if we never thought much aboutit before, we now know that these plants will always have an honoredplace in our landscape.Therewere five plants, growing in our yard, and probably accessible tomost suburbanites, that became central to our diet during thatsummer.DandelionDandelionis one of the most unfairly maligned wild plants out there, which isa shame, because dandelions are tasty, incredibly versatile, andespecially healthful.  What makes the dandelion even more valuable isthat the whole plant can be used, in its time.In theearly spring, the tender greens are harvested for salads and sautés. We also harvest them for dehydrating for use later in soups and as aseasoning during a long Maine winter.  Mid-spring, the flowers areready for harvesting.  The petals add a nice subtle flavor and colorto salads, or the whole flower head can be battered and fried with aflavor and texture a bit like deep fried mushrooms.  The flowers canalso be used to make wine, which can be enjoyed later in the year.Later in the season, the greens become stringy and less palatable,but we used the older, more bitter greens in pesto.  Finally, at theend of the season, in the early fall, we harvest the root, which isdried and roasted, then ground to make a coffee-like beverage.BlueVioletCommonblue violet is one of the first plants to appear in the early spring. Both the leaves and the flowers can be eaten raw in a salad, andthat’s usually how we enjoy them.  The flowers also make abeautiful, edible garnish.  After the Summer Solstice, the violetflowers die back and the leaves get tough and stringy.  At thatpoint, this darling little plant is relegated to lovely ground cover.WoodSorrelAnothergarden pest that sated our hunger over this project is wood sorrel. It has been added to salads and as a garnish for fish to add a richlemony flavor, and on days when there was no been fish and not verymany other greens that are still tender enough for salad, we havemade a soup out of wood sorrel.  With a little butter and salt andsome curry powder, wood sorrel makes a wonderful soup. PurslaneWediscovered purslane, an extremely nutritious and delicious wild weed,quite by accident a few years ago when our daughter noted this oddlooking plant growing in her garden.  Much to her dismay, it competed– and won – for space against the pumpkin seedling, but once Ifigured out what it was, I would not let her pull it.  The weed waspurslane, and it has been favored by savvy gardeners for centuries. We were incredibly thankful for this weed during our project, and ourfavorite way to prepare it is coarsely chopped and stir-fried.BerriesToround out the five foods that we depended on when there was nothingelse we could find is berries.  Most people not only recognizeberries when they see them growing, but they will also have someexperience with foraging berries, either as a childhood treat or as atrail nibble.  Weusually ate the berries raw, but we occasionally incorporated theminto a dish using some of the other plants we had foraged.  Ourfavorite way to cook them was to toss them into our purslanestir-fry.

{"title": "How to Make Coffee Without a Machine", "date": "Wednesday, April 28, 2021", "text": "I'm going to be honest here, and not to sound snarky or know-it-all, but it never occurred to me that there are people out there who don't know that making coffee does not require a machine.  I mean, folks have been drinking coffee for centuries.  How did they make it before Mr. Coffee existed?  This morning, when I was scrolling through FB, I came across a request for a \"free\" coffee maker.  The person posting the request stated that his had started smoking when he tried to use it.  Unfortunately, he didn't have any money \"atm\" (at the moment), and so he couldn't buy a replacement coffee maker, and he was just, seriously, jonesing for some coffee!  He was hoping that someone on the yard sale FB group would have a spare to give him.  I have been drinking coffee for most of my adult life, and for most of those coffee-swilling years, I have made coffee without a machine.  We use a French press, which is a pitcher, usually glass (ours is insulated steel - like a thermos), with a screened plunger attached to a lid.  The coffee grounds are put into the pitcher.  Hot water is poured over the grounds and the lid is put on the pitcher.  After about four minutes, the plunger is pushed down, trapping the coffee grounds at the bottom of the pitcher.As an aside, the first time I saw a French press in use was on the reality TV show, Survivors.  They were off-grid on some tropical island somewhere.  Their French press with coffee grounds was a gifted \"luxury\" item.  They could boil water, and so they could make coffee.  No electricity or machine needed.A French press is comparable in price to an electric coffee maker.  It's possible to get either for less than $30.  It's possible to spend close to $100 or more for either of them, as well.  A local boutique coffee shop here makes \"pour over\" coffee.  There are several different types of apparatus one can purchase for making pour over coffee.  I think the coffee shop uses a CHEMEX style.  It looked fancy.  But the fact is that none of those things are required for making coffee.  All one needs to make coffee are roasted coffee beans that have been ground up; hot (preferably boiling) water; a filter of some sort to hold the grounds; and a vessel to capture the coffee. When I was a very poor college student, I had a (really cheap) electric coffee maker.  It had a basket where the filter and coffee grounds went, and a carafe for the finished brew.  The water was poured into the aquifer at the back of the coffee maker.  As happens, the heating coil fizzled out (that's probably what happened to the FB guy's, too), and since the water wouldn't heat up, no coffee.So, I took the basket off the maker and put it over the carafe.  Then, I boiled water on the stove and manually poured the coffee over the filter and the grounds.  The water dripped down into the carafe, just like it would have if it had been sent through the coffee machine.  And then, I had a nice cuppa.  I was having boutique pour over coffee before it became a thing.  But one doesn't have to do that either.  Since I no longer have a coffee maker, I don't have the basket and I don't have paper coffee filters, but I wanted to experiment using things I have right here around the house.  For my fancy pour over coffee, I used a (clean) cloth napkin and a reused pasta sauce jar.  I folded the napkin into four layers so that the water wouldn't pass through the grounds too quickly.  I laid the folded napkin over the mouth of the jar and pushed some of it inside the opening to create a little nest.  I wrapped a rubber band around the excess on the outside of the jar to hold the napkin in place.  I added two tablespoons of grounds to the napkin filter in the jar.  The amount of grounds depends on how strong one likes one's coffee.Then, I boiled some water and poured it over the grounds.Et voila!  Coffee.  No machine.  No fancy equipment.In fact, using this pour over method, if the water were boiled over an open fire (or on a woodstove, for instance), the only cost to make the coffee would be the cost of the grounds, which means, folks, when your power goes out, you can still have coffee.  All you need is a napkin, some hot water, a jar, and coffee grounds. I considered sharing a link to this article on the FB group - so that the young man, who thinks he needs a new coffee maker to get coffee, can learn that he doesn't have to be limited by the belief that there is only one way to do a thing.  There's a lot of room for innovation and creativity outside of the box."},
{"title": "Upcycled Lunch Bag", "date": "Monday, April 26, 2021", "text": "I love being able to create something from stuff I just have around my house ... and after 20+ years of living in the same place, I'm (almost) embarrassed to admit that we have a LOT of stuff.Most people know that we have a backyard flock of suburban chickens.  They are pretty amazing for giving us eggs and helping keep the backyard tick-free, but since we give them layer pellets and scratch, we end up with a lot of spare feed sacks.  Back in my Granny's day, those feed sacks were made of cloth and were repurposed into things like undergarments for my dad and his siblings.  These days, the feed sacks are made from a (recyclable) plastic material.  Sure, it's recyclable, but as many of us are painfully aware, much of the \"recyclable\" plastic isn't being recycled.  It's one of the reasons we have looked for alternatives to things like bottled drinks.  Sure, we can return the bottles - out of sight, out of mind.  Right?  But the fact is that recycling is the last of the Three R's, because it's the least effective way to deal with our excess of \"stuff.\"  Better is to reuse and/or repurpose.So, I'm always looking for ways to reuse those feed sacks.  We've used them to winterize the chicken coop and rabbit hutches.  I've used them to grow potatoes.  And today, I found a new repurpose - a lunch bag.Deus Ex Machina takes his lunch to work every day.  It's usually leftovers - because I almost always cook too much.  He's had a variety of lunch bags over the years.  The one we purchased for him the most recently (a couple of years ago, now) is starting to show its age in some not really great ways, and so I figured it was time to get him something new.  Making it rather than buying it is one of my favorite things, and so I decided I would try my hand at making him one out of an empty feed sack.The lunch bag he has been using has never been quite the correct size.  We reuse those rectangular, plastic take-out containers, and unfortunately, the lunch bag wasn't big enough to allow the take-out container to sit flat on the bottom of the bag.  I remedied that problem with his new bag.  It's the exact size to allow the take-out container to sit flat.  And it's tall enough that he could take multiple containers (one for salad and one for an entree, maybe) stacked neatly inside the bag.It was a super fun project, and I'm thinking I will probably make a few more, because why not?  What I did:1.  The first step was, of course, to clean the bag, which was easily accomplished by wiping it down with a damp cloth to get the dust from the feed off of it. 2.  Using the take-out container, I measured the sides of the bag.  As it turns out, the bottom strip on the feedsack was exactly the correct size, and so I just cut out the blue colored strip for the sides and bottom of the lunch bag. 3.  For the front of the lunch sack, the picture of the chicken was the perfect size.  With the feed bag still, mostly, intact, I cut two pieces (front and back) using the chicken picture as my guide.  4.  With right-sides together, I pinned everything together and sewed a seam inside the bag, attaching the back and front to the side pieces.  5.  I folded over the top edge and stitched a hem around the top.6.  Then, I put a little stitch in the top corner of each seam so that the bag would sit square.7.  Using one of Deus Ex Machina's old, worn-out, mesh belts, I made a couple of handles, and stitched them on.Et viola!  A \"new\" lunch bag for Deus Ex Machina.At worst, it's a fun conversation piece.  I mean, how many people have a picture of a chicken on their lunch bag?"},

{"title": "Sugaring", "date": "Saturday, March 13, 2021", "text": "We've harvested several gallons of sap at this point.  The sap to syrup ratio is 40:1, roughly.  Today I put 3/4 quart of syrup in a jar.  I also harvested the sap buckets.  It filled the big kettle with two and three-fourths quarts of sap to go into the pan when it boils down a little.We've been boiling the sap on the woodstove.  It's actually a really great use of our resources.  Since we have the woodstove going anyway, it just makes sense to let it do the work.The sap won't get to a hard boil until it gets close to syrup.  Basically, it's more of a slow, evaporating, simmer, which doesn't fill the house with steam and fog up the windows.  It also gives us a much lighter syrup than what we normally get when we boil it outside.  I'm hoping we end up with at least a gallon of syrup.   That would be nice."},
{"title": "How We Survived a Power Outage ", "date": "Friday, March 12, 2021", "text": "A few weeks ago, several of my southern US neighbors experienced a pretty significant winter storm.  They are still cleaning up from the event, from the stories I'm hearing, and some things may never been the same again.  Dealing with a weather event in the midst of this Pandemic, especially for folks who are not accustomed to COLD weather events, would be incredibly difficult, and my hat goes off to those who lived it and survived.  In 1998, a few weeks after Deus Ex Machina and I bought our house in Maine and moved in, there was a massive ice storm here in the northeast.  The entire region from Massachusetts to Quebec was encased in ice.  It was like something out of a Disney movie with some chick named Elsa.  Here on the coast we lost power during that storm, but not for very long - around 24 hours.  Further inland and up into Canada, they did not fare quite as well, and there were places that were without power for weeks.  Yes, plural.Our house had a small, undersized woodstove when we bought it (we've since replaced it and now heat exclusively with wood), and we were able to find a bundle of camp firewood at the local hardware store - enough to keep the chill out of the air.  We moved our mattresses into the living room, where the woodstove is, and all slept out there for that one power-free night.That was my first winter in Maine.  As they say downtown - Bienvenue!  Power outages, while not normal, do happen with a disturbing regularity.  I shared an article about our Thanksgiving Day power outage here.  Thing is, we have days-long events every few years, and so we've learned to deal with them, because they happen.  Sometimes, like the event I describe below in 2008, it's because of really dangerous weather, like an ice storm.  Sometimes it's just because on a beautiful, clear, winter day, there was a lot of wind and something breaks somewhere along the power line.  Sometimes it's because a reckless driver hits a pole.  One time, on a beautifully clear, sunny and HOT day in July we lost power.  I never did find out why that one happened.  It wasn't off for long.  I think we cooked dinner on the grill that night, and maybe made s'mores in the firepit in the front yard.The reality is that our grid system is very fragile, and for those who aren't ready to be without electricity, life will be difficult and uncomfortable.  For us, four days without electricity ended up being just another week.  ==============================Monday,December 15, 2008Ice,Ice, BabyYes,we were among the over 400,000 people in the northeast to be withoutpower following the ice storm on Thursday, December 11.Theelectricity went out around 4:00 am on Friday and came back on about1:00 pm today (Monday).Aftertwo days of being \"powerless\" someone asked me what we didwithout electricity, and I had to think about it.So, what didI do?I baked bread (in a Dutch oven on the woodstove).Idid laundry (using my wash tub and wringer, and hanging clothes on the line to dry).Ifinished reading TheWorst Hard Timeby Timothy Egan (highly recommended!), worked on one of the handmadegifts that didn't require a sewing machine, did dishes, swept the floors,tended the fire, cleaned out the refrigerator and defrosted thefreezer.Thegirls worked in their workbooks by oil lamplight in the earlyevening.Orwrestled with Deus Ex Machina, who had a very much-needed break fromwork on Friday.Myanswer to \"what do you do without electricity?\" was\"Basically the same things we do with it.\"I oftencook on the woodstove. While I don't, typically, hand wash thelaundry, I do always air dry, either on the wooden drying rack set in front of the woodstove or outside on the line.I often read in the evening(or we listen to the audiobook, which we did, using what power wasleft in the UPS to supply juice to the transmitter, which sent theaudio from the iPod into our solar powered radio).And I'vebeen spending quite a lot of time making gifts this season.Afew months ago, over at SeekingSimplicitySasha Cedar talked about voluntarily going without electricity for afew days or a week - it was a kind of \"participate if you want\"challenge. I sowanted to participate, but I knew that Deus Ex Machina would scowl atme at the very suggestion.What's cool about this past stormis that I got my trial without the scowl, and the result was exactlywhat I figured it would be: we survived ... we morethan survived,we livedour lives with barely a change to our normal, everydayactivities.Not much about our lives changed.Exceptthat Precious discovered her favorite way to take a bath was in a wash tub set in the shower stall and filled with water warmed on the woodstove.She calls it the \"shower-bath-thingy\", becauseit's a bath,but it's in the shower.Icall it the \"Farm Girl\" bath.And it's how I bathedfor the three days with no power.We had heat. We had water.We had food. We had fun ... and we stayed clean.What else isthere?Oh, the Internet. Yeah. I missed that :).====================================Fast forward to 2021 ....Since those days, we've done even more to be prepared for a potential outage.  We have solar/USB rechargeable lights.  They are brighter than candles or oil lamps, and better for these old eyes to read by.  We still have the oil lamps, but they are mostly a back-up.  I always stock up on glow sticks for use in the bathrooms.  We have acoustic instruments, and everyone plays.  We have games and books.   Our Internet is through our cellphone provider, and so as long as our devices are charged, we can even have the Internet.  And my laptop computer has a battery, too.  So, I could even do my work-from-home job - at least until my laptop battery died.If the power goes out, we can't just flip a switch and get lights.  I can't cook in the oven in the kitchen.  I can't use my washing machine or dishwasher.  And we'd have to be very careful about opening and closing the refrigerator and freezer.  But we would have lights after it gets dark, and I can cook on the woodstove, on the propane gas grill, in the fire pit, or in my new charcoal fired smoker out in the yard, and I can do laundry and dishes by hand.  And if it's cold enough outside, our refrigerated stuff will be fine outside in a cooler on the front porch.  If we don't open the freezer, that stuff should stay okay, too, for about a week.Mostly, we'd just do what we do.It's a comfort to know that we can be independent of the grid for extended periods and that we would be just fine."},
{"title": "New on the Suburban Farm", "date": "Wednesday, March 3, 2021", "text": "I was on my way home from dropping off Little Fire Faery for in-person classes at the local community college when the phone rang.  My ring tone is the late (and GREAT!) Prince singing, \"Wanna Be Your Lover.\"  The familiar intro blended with the music on the radio, and it took me a minute to realize my phone was ringing. I have a phone holder that slides into the CD player, because I have an older car and luddite-tendencies which mean that even if I could, I probably wouldn't connect my phone to my car's blue-tooth.  Luckily, for me, I don't have blue-tooth in my car, and so I don't have to make that choice, but  Maine is a \"hands-free\" state, which means I can't hold my phone and drive - legally.  I drive a standard shift car - always have in the nearly four decades that I've been driving - and so driving and talking on the phone isn't something I can do anyway.  I need both hands and both feet to drive my car.  I glanced over at the phone, and it was an unfamiliar number.  I've been getting a lot of those \"Hi, this is Beth with Car Warranty Services\" lately.  I assumed that's what it was, but just in case ....I turned off the radio and hit the answer button, but failed to hit the speaker phone button.  I could hear some mumbling.  It didn't sound like Beth from Car Warranty services.I hit the speaker button.Me:  Could you repeat that?Caller:  We have some checks.Me:  I'm sorry.  Who is this?Caller:  It's Bev.  From Long Horn. We have chicks.I laughed.  I had just checked my calendar this morning, and I thought it said that we were expecting our hen-chicks in April.    Me:  Oh.  They're early!Bev:  Well, a little.  They were supposed to be here on the 5th.I told her that I would be there in a bit to pick them up.I drove home and grabbed Precious and a box for the chicks.One of the breeds that I wanted didn't come in, and the breeder wouldn't have them until June.  I ended up substituting with a different breed.So, here they are.  The newest additions to the Brown Family Suburban Farm: two Australorps and an Ameraucana.   The Australorps will lay brown eggs and the Ameraucana's eggs will probably be green.  We haven't named them, yet, except the Ameraucana.  We're considering \"Fluffanutter\" as a name."},

{"title": "Where to Get Seeds - When Everyone is Out", "date": "Tuesday, February 23, 2021", "text": "I was reading this article thismorning.   According to the article, more people are gardening,because of COVID, which is both a positive and negative thing.Obviously more urban and suburbangardeners in our world is a really good thing.  The environmentalimpact of 1000 gardeners with quarter acre homesteads, who arecultivating a variety of plants for a diverse dinner plate, will besignificantly less than one 250 acre monoculture of corn or soybeans.  In fact, replacing lawns with gardens with have a hugepositive impact on the ecological diversity.The negative, as shown in the article,is that the demand on seed companies has been huge, and in the earlydays of the pandemic, many of them had a hard time keeping up, and infact, there are many varieties of seeds that are now very difficult to comeby.Seed companies have had to getcreative, doing all sorts of things from temporarily disabling the ordering function on their websites to less appealing responses – like thatof Johnny Seed, which is favoring commercial growers over home-gardeners, and will not fulfill orders of the latter if there isa conflict.If one is even thinking about (even, ifit's a maybe) adding someedibles to the landscape, the time to order seeds was probably a fewweeks ago, and while it's not too late, finding some varieties (likebeef steak tomatoes or purple carrots) will likely be difficult. Some seed stock may be completely out, which means if the goal was togrow cucumbers, green peppers may end up taking that garden space.While seed companies have provedsomewhat resilient after last years panic buying, they will stillprobably have some deficits, but that doesn't mean that finding seedswill be impossible.  Sometimes, we just need to look closer.I used to love looking through the seedcatalogs.  The variety was impressive, but also a bit overwhelming. The problem for me was a little like a kid at a buffet – my eyesare bigger than my garden, and I would end up with $100 worth ofseeds and only plant a quarter of what I'd purchased.In my novice years, I figured it wasfine.  I could just plant them the next year … and for some seeds,yes, that's true. If the seeds are properly stored,they can be used the next year, but as anyone who sells/saves seedswill tell you, the efficacy of those seeds starts to wane over time. That's why seed packets have dates on them – and some seedcompanies will let you know up front that IF you plant the seeds THISYEAR, you can expect an 80% germination (that is, for every 10 seedsyou plant, you can expect that 8 of them will grow).  The germinationrate will vary (be lower or higher) depending on the type of seed,but the older the seeds are, the lower the germination rate will be.The lesson, for me, was that I couldn'tpurchase a stock of seeds that I could just save forever, becausethey don't last forever.And I stopped ordering seeds throughseed catalogs, because I found that there were so many ways to fillmy garden that didn't include ordering from Johnny Seed.So where do I find seeds?When I started looking, I startedfinding seeds in some places I hadn't never considered that theywould be.Feed StoreI'm not sure whythis one was a surprise to me.  Since their primary customers arefolks who have livestock (and presumably a farm), it shouldn't havesurprised me that they would also carry seeds.  I'm no sure why itdid.  In season, they sell seed packets, but they also have seed potatoes, garlic, and onion starts.  Sometimes I can get deals on other stuffthere, too, like frozen beef, some bulk vegetables, vegetable plants, andlocal honey.Tractor SupplyI usually preferto shop local, as we all know, and I prefer the chicken feed from mylocal feed store, because it's a better quality feed, but the fact is thatthe feed store is less “local” to me than the Tractor Supply with regard to driving distances, andso, sometimes, when I'm pressed for time, I stop at the TractorSupply, because it is on my way.I guess this storeis a cross between a feed store and a hardware store, at least that'swhat it is here.  Ours has an incredible assortment of all sorts ofhomesteading supplies from tools to livestock feed.  They even haveouterwear (like jackets and coats), tee-shirts, jeans, and boots.  Inseason, they have baby chicks and ducklings – with varietiessuitable for both meat and eggs. In a TEOTWAWKI situation, wheneveryone else is heading to the grocery store, I'm going to TractorSupply.  Just sayin'.At my local TSC, Irecently picked up several packets of organic, heirloom seeds fromthe Seeds of Hope company.Hardware StoreNot only have Ibeen able to find seeds at the hardware store, but the seeds I foundwere both local and organic.  My local Ace Hardware carried seedsfrom this company here in Maine.  The Ace Hardware is a locally ownedfranchise and the seed company is a locally owned company, whichfeeds my need to support local businesses.  They also have canningsupplies – usually year round – and real straw brooms. InTEOTWAWKI scenario, I will be stopping at the Ace Hardware, on my way home from TSC.Grocery StoreA few years ago,my local grocery started carrying packets of seeds – in season.  Istarted seeing them around March.Home Improvement StoreI'm not a fan ofshopping at Big Box stores, in general, but last year, when Icouldn't find garlic seed anywhere else, I was able to find it atHome Depot.  It wasn't great seed, and I ended up with a lot of tinygarlic heads.  The seed wasn't well labeled, and after I had plantedand harvested my garlic, I discovered that it was a soft neck garlic(I was waiting for the scapes that never grew ;)).  I discovered thatfor storage purposes, I prefer the soft neck garlic, which can bebraided.  It looks pretty hanging in my kitchen.  So, this year, I was proactive, and when I orderedmy garlic seed – back in September, not from Home Depot – I ordered the soft neckvariety.They have other seeds and plants, also.  I am not comfortable purchasing plants for my garden, because I am not confident thattheir plants are not treated with bee-killing pesticides, likesome of their flowers reportedly are, but in a pinch, I could becompelled to purchase some seed from them.Local NurseryI suppose this oneis a gimme.  Obviously anywhere that sells plants will also have seedfor sale.  Makes sense.  We have several nurseries in my area, and Ihave always been able to find a fair selection of seeds at most ofthem.  I've even found some unique seeds (like nettles) at one of thehigher-end nurseries.But what happenswhen one has exhausted all of those options, and the seed companieshave a back log of weeks?  The growing season is short, here in Maine, and if one has waited too long and ends up on the back-order list, the season may be winding down before the seeds even germinate.  So, what do we do?Buy PlantsThisisn't the most economical option, obviously.  I can get a six pack oftomato plants at the nursery for $2.50, and I have six plants.  I canget a packet of tomato seeds for $1.79, and I could have 20 plants. The issue, for me, is that I don't, necessarily, have the space for20 tomato plants.  As such, some plants are a better option for me, and in fact, I do plant a variety of both plants and seeds.  Also,while some plants will do well with direct sowing, some seeds need tobe planted in a protected place before the last frost to give themthe best opportunity to develop fruit (or produce those tomatoes)during our short growing season here in Maine.   I can direct sowlettuce seeds, and even do subsequent plantings, because lettuce ismore cold hardy, and I can direct sow the seeds earlier than I cantender tomatoes, and also, lettuce matures much faster than tomatoes. I might need 75 days from seed to harvest for a tomato.  From seedto plate for lettuce, I need 28 days.Thatmeans I can direct sow my lettuce seeds in mid-April and have a freshsalad from my garden by Mother's Day.   Common wisdom here in Maineis to not plant the warm-loving plants until after Memorial Day,which means I can't even hope for a tomato until August, if I directsow the seeds.  If I buy tomato plants that have been grown in a greenhouse and hardened off, and put them in my garden onMemorial Day, I might have tomatoes for my Independence Day celebration.Buyingplants is more expensive than buying seeds, but it's still lessexpensive to grow your own than it is to purchase them.Unfortunately,the nurseries only grow so much, and only have certain plantsavailable at certain times.  Once they've sold out of those vegetableplants, that's it for the year.So,what to do if you've missed the boat on buying plants, and the seedcompanies STILL have a back log of weeks?Go to the Grocery StoreI realize I havealready mentioned that the grocery store has seed packets – inseason.  What they also have is vegetables and fruits, many of whichhave seeds or are seeds.  There are a surprising numberof plants that can be grown from scraps or from seeds saved fromvegetable scraps.  For starters, pepper and tomato seeds can beregrown from “organic” peppers and tomatoes purchased at thestore.Ihave grown potatoes, onions, and ginger from grocery store purchases.Lookbeyond the produce aisle, though.  A fact many people don't know isthat the dried beans can also be sprouted and grown.  As this article points out, many of the seeds won't be viable, but some of them will be. In the absence of other choices, a pound of dried beans costs $2.50and might produce several plants. Worst case, the beans that were soaked, but didn't sprout, can be cooked for supper.Anotherpotential food source is raw peanuts, which can be grown from peanuts purchased at the grocery store.  They have to be raw though. They don't have a great success rate, but any are better than none.  Alsocheck out the bulk bins and the grain aisles for chia seeds (remember“chia pets”?) and flax seeds, which might sprout.  And if youhave a health food store near you, you might also find a seedsprouting mix.  If the seeds will sprout, they will grow a plant.Whenplanning a garden, obviously, the best option is to plan the gardenwell in advance of the growing season, and to order or otherwiseprocure any supplies one might need before the ground is even ready to plant.Unfortunately,in our very busy world, sometimes stuff happens, and we don't getdone the things we intended to do.  If that's the case for your seedordering, don't despair.  You still have options."},
{"title": "It's a Good Life", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2021", "text": "Today is overcast and cloudy.  Snow is in the forecast ... again.  I live in Maine.  Snow SHOULD be in the forecast during the winter, and that we're going to get snow, in February, shouldn't be a surprise or an emergency.  I have a friend who lives in Texas, and the news stations down there are warning of the coming snow-pocalypse - according to her Facebook feed.  It's different here than there.  She says the store shelves are bare from people panic buying in advance of the storm.  One of her friends asked if Texan homes even had heat.  It's funny ... but not funny.  Being cold is no fun.We spend a lot of time preparing for winter, here in our Maine suburban home.  During the summer, we spend many weekends working wood for our winter heat.  Some of our wood supply comes from purchased wood we get from a local firewood purveyor.  Sometimes we are gifted wood.  One year we received a couple of small trailer loads of coppiced wood that a local tree firm had cut.  They just happened to be driving by our house and saw our stacks of firewood.  They stopped, on a whim, to ask if we wanted what they had in their trailer.  They'd been cutting trees locally, but didn't have anywhere, close, to dump their truck load.  They gave it to us.  The limbs were varying lengths and widths, and our task was to cut it to length and then split and stack it.  I got to try out my new chainsaw, which was cool.My youngest daughter has really been enjoying our firewood prepping chores over the last few years.  A few summers ago, when were were out at my father-in-law's property cutting wood, she learned to use the gas powered splitter.  We don't have a gas powered splitter here.  Buying one is expensive, especially considering we can borrow the in-law's splitter, but also, we just don't have a place to store it. We do have a manual splitter and a maul.  She's learning to use both.I looked over at her the summer before last, splitting wood barefooted and thought. \"What a suburban-kid thing to do!\", and immediately ran inside to grab my phone to get a picture - which is a quintessentially suburban mom thing to do, I think. Sometimes, I think it's funny that my kids have learned all of the skills that they've learned.  Knowing how to heat a house with wood is just one of the many skills we've forced them to know, because, for us, these skills teach them to do things for themselves.  They can stay warm.  They can eat.  They can survive - in the best of times and in the worst of times.The reality of our lives is that we live in the suburbs.  Our daughters have lived this balance between going to the mall to hang out with their friends and having to do things, like keeping the woodstove going during the winter and collecting the eggs from the backyard chickens.They've been given the opportunity to enjoy the best of being an urban kid (trips to see Broadway shows, eating at boutique restaurants, enjoying a latte from a real coffee shop, shopping for books in dusty, antique bookstores) and the best of being a farm kid (fluffy baby animals in the backyard, a healthy garden, county fairs, meaningful work).Some writers speak of the suburbs as a failed experiment and as the \"worst allocation of resources in history.\"  I don't agree.  I agree that the car-dependence of some suburbs and the unwillingness of some suburbanites to use their land to cultivate food is short-sighted and wasteful, but I also think, with some reimaging, and maybe retooling, the suburbs can be what save us in a powered down future.For now, though, and for my family, I think it's the best of both worlds.  My daughters have been given this amazing opportunity to work hard doing work that has meaning (stacking wood is not easy, but it's absolutely necessary if we hope to stay warm in the winter), but they've also had the chance to live like a normal, suburban teenager.That day, we were working wood, and as Precious split a log, she looked at Little Fire Faery, who was stacking the wood in neat rows against the fence, and asked, \"Hey, do you want to go the mall later?\"And that's our life.  Stack wood in the morning.  Go to the mall in the afternoon.  Eat a home-cooked meal (slow-cooked roast from locally sourced beef, mashed potatoes from our garden, sweet corn from a local farmer, and baked caramel apples) in the evening.Good work.  Good fun.  Good food.It's a good life here in the suburbs."},
{"title": "Coming Home: Revaluing Women's Work", "date": "Tuesday, February 9, 2021", "text": "Iwoke up earlier than usual this morning.  It happens some days. Usually, Deus Ex Machina gets up around 4:45AM.  I don't even hearthe alarm.  Sometimes I feel him get up, and I hear him starting hismorning routine.  I am lulled back to sleep by the familiarity of it:  the soft rustle of him pulling on a pair of sweatpants and slipping into a long-sleeved shirt; the ticking of the dogs' toenails on the laminate flooring in the hallway as they run to the kitchen for their breakfast; the metallic squeal of latch on the woodstove door he opens to feed the fire; the click and whoosh of his opening the sliding glass door to let the dogs into the back yard after they've eaten.  SometimesI lay semi-awake listening to the symphony of my house comingalive.Thedogs scratch at the glass slider, finished with their toilet andready to come back into the warm house from the snowy backyard – perhaps hoping for a secondhelping of kibbles and bits.  I unfold myself from the embrace of my warm bed to let themin.  Sometimes I crawl back under the down and snuggle back into the cocoon.  Sometimes I get up and join Deus Ex Machina in the livingroom for coffee and Yoga.  This morning was the latter.AfterYoga, Deus Ex Machina heads to the shower.  If I'm not awake forYoga, he will gently wake me after his workout, softly caressing my feet and whispering, “Time to getup.  There's coffee”  (and there's always a cup of coffee ready andwaiting for me on the counter), and I go into the kitchen and makehis breakfast.  Usually, something with eggs, because the backyardchickens are incredibly generous – even right now when the sun isstill low on the horizon and living the Benjamin Franklin advice:early to bed … although not so much of the early to rise happeningthis time of year with our days still firmly in winter's grip.Afterhis shower, Deus Ex Machina gets his lunch together (usuallyleftovers from previous nights' dinners – I always cook too much,and he teases me about being an Italian grandma, even though I'm notItalian). Some mornings he wolfs down the breakfast sandwich I'vemade for him before he leaves. Some mornings, he grabs a cloth napkinand takes it with him.Severaldays a week, he drops Precious off at work.  She works at a local café and has to be at work before rush hour traffic (and theirbreakfast patrons).   In season, Little Fire Faery, who is alandscaper, has to be at work at the same time. She grabs her coffee and some fruit for lunch and walks next door to her job.  By 7:00AM, the earlymorning rush to get everyone coffee'd up and out the door ends, andI'm left to sit quietly with a second (or third, depending on themorning) cup of coffee, a warm cat on my lap, and a few minutes tocheck email, read the news, and scroll social media.Mylife as a work from home housewife is slow, and I don't mean that mydays are languorous and long, but rather that the activities thatfill my days are the slow kind of life that people who live alife-by-hand lead.  Sweeping floors with a real broom.  Caring forthe backyard flock.  Cooking from scratch.  Tending the homefires, both literally and figuratively.  In the spring and summer, there is planting and tending the garden, and caring for the baby chicks that will be next years laying hens or next winter's chicken soup.  There's always something to do. Ioften take for granted that what I do every day is just \"normal\" - everyone's every day life - but it'snot true.  I live an extraordinary life, and many people, especiallytwo-income households, don't have the luxury I have every day to bakea loaf of bread or mend a pair of pants.Icall it a luxury, and it is ... ish.  I have heard people lamentingthat they wish they could have my life – to “not have to work” - but *they* don't think they can afford it.That'swhere they are wrong.Itis absolutely possible to support a family on a single income, andmoreover, not having a paid job working outside the home,can actually yield a higher “income” than what most women willearn annually anyway.  But there has to be a willingness to live with fewer conveniences and do more by hand.   A broom costs $8.  A vacuum costs $40.Themedian income for women in the United States is $25,307 (source:https://datacommons.org/place/country/USA).  If that amount is for afull-time job (40 hours a week), the average hourly wage for aworking woman is around $12.  We'll assume that our source is givingus the before taxes rate, which means that the average take home perhour rate is around $10. That's the amount one will have to spend on stuff.  And that's important for calculating whatone is paying just to work.AboveI mentioned that I am able to make a loaf of bread.  What I didn'tmention above about making bread is that we are gluten-free.  A loafof gluten-free bread from the store costs around $6.  Gluten-freesandwich loaves are smaller than normal loaves of sliced bread. A loaf of gluten-free bread is only about 12 slices (or six sandwiches), but thepieces of bread are about three-fourths the size of the piece ofbread of a normal loaf of sandwich bread.  So, basically, for $6, wecan get four regular-sized sandwiches.  Ifboth Deus Ex Machina and I worked full-time and brought sandwichesfrom home for lunch each day, we would need threeloaves of bread just for our lunches (and that's if we each only use two slices of bread and have a three-quarters sized sandwich for our midday meal).  If I earned the average wagefor women in the US, I would have to work an hour and a half just for a few sandwiches.  Eating out would cost a lot more, for sure, but isn't it a little dispiriting to note that bringing lunch to work costs 15 minutes of wages - even when the food is brought from home?  Oh, and we didn't calculate the cost of meat, cheese, or peanut butter to go on the sandwich.  That's just for the bread.Aloaf of homemade, gluten-free bread costs around $3.  If I work fromhome, I don't have to have a sandwich, because I don't need a quickgrab-and-go lunch, and if Deus Ex Machina takes a sandwich to workeach day using my homemade bread, we would only need one loaf.MyNOT having job would save us $750/year (assuming $15/week for thebread times 50 weeks) juston sandwich bread.Andthat's just one, very small example of the cost savings.  The fact isthat having a two income household does not, necessarily, raise one'sstandard of living, when the cost of having a job is figured into thebudget.Thereare so many, other costs that are often ignored or glossed over,because those things are just part of having a job – like puttinggasoline in the car.In January 2018, afterworking from home for 20 years, I took a job working part-timeoutside the home.  I had a very short commute,compared to most people.  My job was 10 miles round trip from myhouse.  Depending on traffic, my total commute there and back was about a half hour perday, five days a week.Mycar is fairly fuel efficient, averaging 32/mpg, which means at 10miles per day, I used one and ¾ gallons of gasoline per week to getback and forth to work.  Gasoline has been averaging around$2.50/gallon for the last three years.  My annual cost for gasolinewas $218.75. That doesn't sound like much, for sure, but I had to work 15 minutes just to pay for the gas ittook to drive my car to work, which means I lost that money and that time - just to have a job.  If I had to pay for parking, which occasionally happened, it was $5/day.  I lost another half hours' wages just to leave my car in a parking lot while I worked.  I can park it for free in my driveway - just sayin'.  Mostpeople aren't lucky enough to live 5 miles from where they work, andneither do they have as fuel-efficient of a car as I have.  Theaverage commute for folks here in the US is around 32 miles roundtrip (so three times my commute), and the average gas mileage for acar here in the US is 25 mpg.  A worker traveling 32 miles round trip in a car that gets 25 mpg uses about 1.28 gallons of gasoline per day.  At $2.50/gallon, theannual cost for just gasoline to travel to and from work is $800.  Theperson who is bringing home $10/hour has to work for an hour and ahalf a week just to pay for gasoline. That's just forgasoline.  That doesn't even include the cost of the car payment(because most people also don't own their car outright), taxes, andinsurance.  It also doesn't include the cost of parking fees or turnpike fees - both of which are a reality where I live.  It costs $2 a day for a commuter pass on the turnpike, which is an additional $10 a week - or another hour of lost wages just to get to work.  Beforestarting my part-time job, I had spent many years working from home.  I was a huge advocate for more people adopting a WAH lifestyle, because I'd done a lot of research on the cost of having an outside-the-home job. I knew the benefits of a one-income family with a SAH/WAH parent/partner.  In 2017, I dissolved my home-based business.  My kids were, mostly, grown up, and like many stay-at-home moms with older kids, I thought, maybe I should get a job outside the home.  In December, the organization where I had been a long-time volunteer announced a job opening for an office manager/admin assistant.  With almost 30 years of experience in office work and business management under my belt, the job description could have been written with me in mind, and since I was alreadydoing several of the job duties as an unpaid volunteer, applying for the job seemed like a no brainer.  But, after almost three years in that job, when I realized how much my job was costing in actual money spentjust to keep going to work (and that's not including any of themental or emotional toll the job took on me and on us as a family),it no longer made sense to keep the working there. What's worse, though, was that the income I earned going to work every day was basically the same amount of money I had earned working from home all of those years (allowing for inflation, I actually made MORE working from home than I did going to the office), but the cost of going to the job each day was significantly higher.Thereis a misconception that is perpetuated by our society that two parentfamilies NEED two incomes to survive, and in perpetuating that mythwe are doing a great disservice to ourselves and our families.Ina 2012 commencement speech to the graduating class of BarnardCollege, then, President Obama told the women in the class, “Weknow … this country would be better off if more Americans were ableto get the ... specific skills and training that employersare looking for today.”The emphasis of his speech was to tell these women that they needed to work, nay, that they should WANT to work - above all else, because working = value.  Paradoxically, his wife, the venerable Michelle Obama, was a stay-at-home Mom through his tenure in the White House.  While she \"worked\", as do many of us SAHM, on various community service projects and served on bunches of committees (unpaid, like my own work as a Board member at my local library and at my local food pantry, and a dog walker and foster care provider for the animal shelter), her professional career was curtailed shortly after her daughters' births and her husband's bid for the White House.Undaunted by the fact that his wife wasn't a wage earner, hegoes further to say that Americans “... arebetter off when women are treated fairly and equally in every aspectof American life — whether it’s thesalary you earn or the health decisions you make.”  No mention of the nobility of eschewing a wage to be a home-maker.There is no room for having a conversation about the unpaid work in our lives or for those who wish to do it full-time in lieu of a having a career making money.Certainly,most of the women he was addressing went to college in the first place because theyintended to be financially self-sufficient, as did I, but the problemwith speeches like this and the ideas that they perpetuate is thatthey validate the assumption that women (and men) who don'tearn a salaryare not “equal” tomen (and women) who do.Well, unless they are the well-educated wives of rich politicians.  Andthat idea is the most egregious lie our society has embraced, and by continuing to conserve the notion that men and women must make money, we will destroy any hope of creating a sustainable future, because the fact is that unlimited growth, as measured in dollars (which is how we do it), is unsustainable in a world with finite resources.  We need more people who can make something other than money, for reasons more noble than the desire to earn cash.We'reheading into a new world – one with diminishing resources – andwe will need people who know how to do more than make money, butuntil or unless our society can start seeing the value in those of uswho have chosen to be keepers of hearth and home, we will continue tolose the skills that we will need when our lives get slower, anddriving 30 miles one way to a job won't be possible, because therewon't be a job ... and there will be nothing to drive."},

{"title": "Where to Shop Instead of Amazon", "date": "Wednesday, February 3, 2021", "text": "Interestingly, James Wesley Rawles and I started blogging around the same time.  He was certainly more focused in his blog topic than I was.  At the time, the purpose of my blog was going to be to promote the work-at-home lifestyle.  Funny where we ended up.  Mr. Rawles has made a very comfortable living with his blog.  He has over a third a million regular readers.  I am awed.  Frankly, I'd be happy with 1% of his readership ;).  A very substantial piece of his income, according to this post, has been his affiliation with Amazon, and so it's actually pretty amazing that he has decided to quit them.Like Rawles and most bloggers, I was an Amazon affiliate in the early days, but Amazon and I split more than a decade ago.  Frankly, as a Mainer, Amazon didn't really treat me very well.  I was an affiliate for many years, when the whole sales tax issue came up, and Amazon decided that they would no longer support affiliates from the States that were suddenly requiring taxes be paid.  Amazon was already big enough that they didn't want or need us Mainer affiliates. They were influential enough that they decided they didn't have to pay taxes.  They dropped me as a link affiliate.  Then, I decided that I was no longer interested in being a Marketplace vendor, and I closed my account with them.  I haven't been a regular customer of theirs for years (even though my family still uses the service).  Even during the pandemic, I found other online retailers from which to order things I could not find locally.  Deus Ex Machina has still used the service, but his more recent experiences have been very poor.  Some of the products are really not what he expected.  That's been interesting.  I'm hoping for a straw, soon, that will prompt him to seek other online vendors. For me, Amazon has become the new Wal-Mart, and I have been boycotting Wal-Mart for more than a decade.  I've taken a lot of flack and heard all of the excuses from my friends and family who still patronize Wal-Mart, because: 1.  They don't have another choice (there's ALWAYS another choice).2.  They can't find what they need anywhere except Wal-Mart (seriously?  See above.  I haven't shopped there in a decade, and I have never wanted for something I needed).3.  They have the best prices (I challenge this assumption.  Some things, perhaps, but I think it all balances out in the end).Usually the truth is that Wal-Mart is just easier and more convenient, and that is a truth I can understand, even if I don't agree with being a lazy consumer.  It's only through very conscience choices that we can make change. Margaret Mead is credited with having said:  \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\"  We all talk about wanting to affect positive change.  Taking Margaret Mead's words to heart and being that \"small group\" who does something different - even if it is just not shopping at a particular store, can make a small difference.  And that's what counts, right?Amazon has the same reputation.  It's easier just to find it on Amazon, because they have everything.  Ten years ago there were a lot of us small-time independent sellers on Amazon's Marketplace.  We depended on Amazon's much larger customer base, hoping that folks would weed through the myriad of choices and find our little store fronts.    I sold used books for a while, but Amazon would only allow me to charge $3.95 for postage - regardless of what it cost me to send the book, and there were so many of us selling books that many titles ended up selling for a penny.  The short of it is that if I sent the book media mail, I might earn $2.50 on the book, but if I sent it media mail, and it took too long to arrive in the buyer's hands, I would get dinged as a seller.  One time I sold a transcriber.  It worked just fine when I sent it.  The mail service didn't treat it kindly, and when it arrived at its destination, it was no longer working.  Not only did I have to refund the buyer, but I also lost the postage - both ways.  Suffice it to say that I didn't earn even a fraction of what Rawles earns on Amazon - not as a link affiliate, nor as a Marketplace seller.  Quitting them as a vendor was easy, for me.Quitting them as a customer has been just as easy.So where do I go?I have found a number of alternatives, and please note that I am not an affiliate of any business.  This is an ad-free blog, and any links provided are for information purposes only.  I don't get a dime (except the Thrive Market link - and only if you use my link - which you don't have to - and place an order).GO STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCEThere are a number of companies and individuals who sell through Amazon, but the fact is that they often have online sales of their own.  I am a fan of Dr. Bonner's soaps.  I use the bar soap for an all over wash, including my shampoo.  I like peppermint in the summer, because it's cooling, but I prefer almond in the winter.  Unfortunately, my local grocery either stopped carrying almond scent or they have just always run out before I got there.  So, several months ago, I went online and I found the Dr. Bonner's website.  They had plenty of the scent I wanted.  I ordered 10 bars for about the same price per bar that I would have paid at the grocery store. Amazon has the liquid castille soap, peppermint scented, for $32.49 for 2 quarts.  It's $18.48/quart on Dr. Bonner's website.  So, yes, it's cheaper at Amazon, but sometimes saving a couple of dollars shouldn't be the ultimate goal.  If cheaper is the primary motivator, there are other options, still.  This company sells Dr. Bonner's liquid soap for $16.99/quart.  Their mission statement includes: \"working to increase ... sustainability and social responsibility.\"  They only sell \"natural\" products.  Giving back to a company that strives to give back could be a better option and make that extra dollar per quart a bit more palatable.  Personally, I prefer to go to the source, because, unless they discontinue the scent I like, the official website of whatever retailer is absolutely more likely to have what I want than one of their affiliates. FIND A LOCAL ALTERNATIVEWhen Amazon first started, they were an online bookseller.  Over the years, their business has expanded to the point that sales really are for them secondary to what they really offer.  According to Rawles' website, Amazon is primarily focused these days on their server farm.  Seems the intent is to control what we buy and sell and think and do on the Internet.  Interesting.I haven't bought books on Amazon for a long time, and even in the midst of the Pandemic, when all of the local stores were closed, I found an alternative to ordering books online.  There are half a dozen locally owned bookstores in my area.  Most of them have an online catalog and online ordering, and started curbside pick-up.Even better, my local library offered borrowing services, and they would ship it to me, at no charge.  I just had to drop the books back off in their drop box.    Amazon wouldn't have offered better service.I know a lot of folks think that Amazon is easier, but what I've found is that they have so many choices and so many vendors, I get bogged down trying to find what I want.  Reading through all of the fine-print is also time-consuming, and then, too often, when the product arrives, it's not what I thought I ordered.  What I've found is that I prefer online shops that specialize in what they do, and the following are some other online shops I have visited that helped me avoid Amazon. Battery Depot - My laptop battery completely died. I ordered a replacement from these folks.  I received my order within a week of ordering it, and it works exactly like it should.  Wild Berry Incense - I really love my Patchouli incense, but finding it locally is always a challenge.  A lot of places that sell incense have started selling blends, which I usually don't like.  I'm very sensitive to smell and the wrong scent will give me a headache and/or make me nauseous.  I ordered (probably way too much) incense from this company. It's exactly the scent I want without the headache and nausea, and the price was pretty decent, too. Thrive Market (if you sign up for Thrive with this link, I will actually get a referral bonus - just FYI).  Amazon now owns Whole Foods.  I've never been a Whole Foods shopper, but in the midst of the pandemic, when our local grocery store was out of the Seventh Generation 100% post consumer recycled materials TP that we usually buy, we started looking around for places we could order it online.  Whole Foods claimed to have it.  So, we ordered.  Then, it turns out that they didn't have it and our order was cancelled - not once, but twice.  The first time, it took them a day and a half to tell us that we couldn't get the next day delivery they promised.  WTF?So, I started looking for alternatives.  Thrive is an online purveyor of organic foods.  Like Trader Joe's, they have their own brand, but they also carry a lot of familiar organic and natural brands of groceries and other goods (including the above mentioned TP).    Royal Silk is a place to purchase high-end men's undergarments.  And we all know that we can get lady's garments from Victoria's Secret, which often has pretty decent sales.  My daughter has her own account with VS Pink.   My friend recently posted a link to this online shop, where I can procure materials and patterns to make my own.   Making them myself is the ultimate in happy-making consumerism.L. L. Bean - This past Christmas, Deus Ex Machina got a fresh wardrobe both underwear and outerwear :D.  I may have saved money if I'd gone through Amazon, but I trust the commitment to service and quality from L.

Bean, and if he didn't like it, we could take it to Freeport and exchange it.======================A lot of people give a lot of lip service to wanting to do better, to save the environment, to whatever catch-phrase they're reciting, but the bottom line is action, not words, is where it's at, and there's no greater revolutionary act in a Corptocracy than telling the corporations to pound sand and spending your dollars someplace else.My point is that if we just look, we can probably find everything we want with very few exceptions someplace other than Amazon."},
{"title": "When Preparing for the Storm is Everyday Life", "date": "Tuesday, February 2, 2021", "text": "We had our first, really significant, snow of the season starting last night into this morning.  It's sleeting now, which means that the beautiful, fluffy snow cover will be a crusted, icy mess.  For the record, I actually love the snow.  I love how clean everything looks after a good snowfall.  I don't even mind clean up, so much, depending on the type of snow.  According to folklore the Intuits had 40+ words for snow, and after having lived in Maine for more than two decades, I can see that.  All snow is not equal.  The first snow of the season is often a heavy, wet snow - like big, floppy waffles.  Later in the season, as it gets colder and the air is dryer, the flakes are small and light, like ash.  Toward spring, the flakes are bigger, but heavier, again, like leaves.  It's the quality of the air that makes the snowflake what it is.  Dryer air = lighter flakes.The worst is the storms that bring both snow and ice.  Not only are they a bear to clean up, but they are also the most dangerous.  Ice storms kill trees and snap power lines, because the snow-covered, iced-over branches and cables are heavy.This particular storm was dubbed a Nor'easter by the newscasters, and in my area, we were told to expect 6\" to 12\".  We definitely got 6\" of snow overnight.  Now, before lunchtime, we have sleet.  It's getting bad out there, and I am very thankful that we were all working from home today, because driving would be a mess - even for those of us who have driven in this sort of weather a lot.  It's just no fun, and it's better if we can just stay home.What's interesting, to me, is the media reporting of these storms.  I guess since we've had so little snow this season it is big news.  Plus, we have a lot of COVID refugees - people who have moved to Maine from away, because it is safer here, presumably.  Maybe our news-folk are playing to their new audience.Whatever the reason, this storm, a 6\" to 12\" storm, was hyped up.  What's interesting, to me, is how much attention has been paid to issues other than driving.  As with almost every storm we've seen this year - rain or snow ... or just wind - the media warns that we could experience \"power outages.\" The fact that we are warned about power outages, though, struck me.  Someone out there knows how fragile our grid system is, and they want us, as individuals, to be prepared to take care of ourselves, because we are going to be without power.  Before we went to bed last night, we made sure our phones were charging ... but all of us plug in our phones before bed every night.  So, that wasn't new. We made sure that our solar/USB lights and head lamps were charged ... but we use the headlamps and such nearly every evening when we go outside to tend to the chickens.  So, that wasn't all that new, either.I washed a load of laundry, which will go on the drying rack, but I frequently take advantage of the off-peak rates by doing laundry and running the dishwasher late in the evening or at night.  So, that wasn't new, either.These are things that we do, because this is the way we live.The fact that we know the power grid is fragile is enough for me to want to live differently, because I don't like the idea of being worried about losing a resource that's unreliable to begin with.  I mean, who wants to live with that niggling worry all of the time?  Not being wholly dependent on 24 hour/365 day access to electricity makes storms, like today's, just a lovely treat - because we all get to stay home and enjoy the day together without worrying about whether the electricity will go out, and we'll be thrust into the cold and dark of a powerless world. We won't be.  And that's a comfort."},
{"title": "Appropriate Technologies", "date": "Thursday, January 28, 2021", "text": "I was helping a friend with a writing project recently.  She was writing this post-apocalypse story.  One of the characters was an engineer before TSH.  For plot advancement, he needed to come up with some very creative and useful thing that none of the other characters would be able to make.  She decided he needed to make a generator using some low-tech mechanical engineering hocus-pocus.  In fact, her solution was a little more dream than reality, which is what I told her.  I told her that what she was describing wouldn't work.The thing is, what she was hoping to accomplish wasn't really necessary anyway, and I find, all too frequently, that people in the prepper world, and especially in prepper fiction, fixate on this one technology that everyone things we need the most - electricity.Which confuses me, because having unlimited access to electricity is new.  My generation is the first in my family to have access to unlimited electricity.   Neither of my parents lived in homes that were electrified for their entire childhoods.  Heck, my grandma didn't even have indoor plumbing until the 1970s.  John Michael Greer has written extensively about appropriate technologies for a powering down world.  One of his commentaries, that has stuck with me, had to do with windows.  The R-Value (that is, the insulative property of a material) of a window is, essentially, zero.  Basically, regardless, of how fancy, multi-layered, or argon gas-filled your replacement windows are, the insulative properties are not much different than if you had nothing there (the glass keeps out the wind and rain - which is good).  Heavy curtains are actually better than fancy windows.JMG suggests, instead of spending thousands of dollars on replacement windows that aren't really going to do much more than the single-pane windows that are already there, insulating the ceilings, walls, and floors - at what is likely to be a much lower cost than those fancy vinyl windows, anyway.  Increasing the r-value of the rest of the house will do a lot more in energy savings and a lot more to keep your home a comfortable temperature than the best windows money can buy.We had a saying in the military - KISS.  Everything is an acronym.  KISS means, \"Keep It Simple, Stupid.\"  Ignoring the pejorative at the end, the idea is that often the most simple solution is the best, and such is more true than not when it comes to the kinds of things we are going to want and need in a powered down future.I spend a lot of time thinking about what I really need with regard to appliances and household conveniences.I need heat, because it gets cold, and while I love cold weather, I prefer it if I can be inside my warm house drinking a cup of hot coffee and watching the beautiful snow flakes as they dance through the air on their way to blanket the ground in soft white.  I like having a woodstove, because while it's a lot of work, year round, and a lot of mess, that woodstove provides my heat, but it also allows me to cook.  I also, very much, appreciate that I don't need electricity for heating or cooking in the winter.In fact, the only two things for which I really, REALY need and appreciate the electric grid are my clothes washing machine and the freezer.  Hand washing and wringing clothes is painful work.  Yes, I've done it - whole loads of heavy clothes, like jeans, and yes, I have a wringer.  It's no wonder that pioneer women had some massive biceps.  And there's just no substitute for the convenience of having a years' worth of food safely frozen until I'm ready to use it.Electricity generation is pretty tricky ... or not.  It can be done in a lot of fairly low-tech ways.  Wind and solar are the most talked about when it comes to home uses, but much of our electric grid is actually powered by steam generation.  Even the fancy-smancy Nuclear power plants are really just simple steam engines.  The fancy part is that the process of splitting the atoms makes heat, which heats up the water to make steam, with turns a turbine, which makes the electricity.  Coal powered plants do the same thing - burn coal to create heat to make steam and turn a turbine to create electricity.    It's curious why someone hasn't come up with a way to create a residential-sized steam engine for home-power generation.  Perhaps it would have to be too big and would use too much wood for too little gain (?).  I don't know the answer.What I do know is that running my freezer uses about .8kWh per day (if I leave it plugged in all of the time, which I do) and running a washing machine uses about 2.25kWh each use, which seems like a lot, but I'll have to believe Google.  If I only needed my freezer and my washing machine, I would have to generate 2 kWh per day, and I'd need to unplug my freezer while I was doing laundry.  So, when I read the stories and hear the preppers harping on generators, I have to wonder. What is it that they are trying to power that is SO important?  What do they need electricity for, exactly?In the story, the idea was to use human power to produce electricity.  If you've been a reader of my blog for any length of time, then, you are aware that we had a bicycle generator a few years ago.  I guess I know a little bit about human-produced electricity.  While it's possible to produce electricity on a bike generator, it requires a lot of energy on the cyclist's part.  A lone cyclist can produce about 100 watts in an hour's time.  If everyone in my house rode the bike generator for one hour per day, we'd have 400 watts of power saved.  If we were able to use 100% of the power that was generated, we still wouldn't even have enough electricity stored after a full day of bike riding to keep our freezer frozen.  So, I had to ask.  What are they trying to power?  What thing could they gain by having the tiny amount of electricity generated by bicycle power?  Maybe some electric lights.  Maybe a laptop, for entertainment.  And, then, I actually recommended something else for the engineer to do that would be awesome and give the characters a sense of \"normalcy.\" I suggested he rig up a shower using hot water from the woodstove.  I was thinking about it this morning, when I was enjoying my own shower.  It bothers me in those post-apocalyptic stories in which everyone is always so dirty, and I always wonder why they can't stay somewhat clean.  Heating up water is useful for a lot of different applications, including making it safe to drink, and while you're sterilizing your drinking water, why not heat up a couple more gallons for a nice, hot bath or shower?I also suggested the shower for a more base and fundamental reason.  There's nothing quite so wonderful in the world as feeling clean, as anyone who has ever been camping ... like, *real* camping, not glamping in an RV or renting an overnight tent plot in a camping resort that includes flush toilets and hot showers.  After a weekend of not showering or having baby-wipe baths, there's nothing quite so wonderful as being full-body under a spray of warm water.  In so many of the stories that I've read told by people who have survived societal collapse, one of the things they report missing the most are those little things, like sweet-smelling soap and maybe a little bit of lipstick ... or deodorant.  In the interest of preparedness, do yourself a favor and stock up on toiletries, or learn to make them.Also in the interest of preparedness, think about the technologies that you most value.  Think about the things you know you could live without, if you had to, and think about those things that really DO make your life nicer, easier, more comfortable, more enjoyable.  Those are the things that you're going to want to be able to keep when the SHTF.  I will want to generate enough power to keep my freezer - which, according to Google is about .8kWh/day, which would cost me less than $1000 to set-up.    Since I wouldn't *need* to keep the freezer plugged in all day, I could have access to the array for charging phones, laptops, and lightbulbsAnd for a showers, I found this nifty little gadget.  It's just a shower pump.  Fill a bucket with hot water, and have a shower anywhere.What we *need* is actually pretty simple, most of the time.  There are a lot of folks who are predicting resource scarcity in the very near future and have been for decades.  We really do have nothing to lose by getting ready.And, in the case of learning to embrace a lower-energy dependent lifestyle, we might actually gain from it. For me, for $1000 initial investment, and a willingness to work my biceps, we could eliminate $100/month worth of expenses."},
{"title": "Positive Effects of the Pandemic", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2021", "text": "I predict that this will be an incredibly unpopular post, because I think people aren't ready or willing to accept that 2020 wasn't a complete shit-show.The Pandemic, which started here in the United States in March 2020, has wreaked havoc with our social fabric.  People have died.  Individuals and businesses have been financially devastated. The economy is, arguably, in shambles, and probably won't recover to what it was before anytime soon. The philosophical, religious, and political (and, yes, I absolutely do mean to lump them all together, implying that they are intricately linked) divide has widened, perhaps beyond any ability to close the gap. I, personally, have lost friends because of the very deep divide between those of us who want better answers than, \"because I said so,\" and those who want to shame us for seeking more and/or better information.  I am not the only one who has been shamed to silence by people who (probably) mean well, but can't hear anything other than their own fear.  Those who were extroverts before the pandemic have suffered from wont of social stimulation.  Those of us who were introverts before the stay-at-home stratagems took affect have thrived in this new world.  There have been some really bad bits, for sure,  but at least from where I'm sitting, there have also been a lot of positives.Let's take a look.More People are Working from HomeI'm sure some of the above-mentioned extroverts will argue that this is *not* a positive outcome.  That's okay.  Argue away, but before you say nay, take a listen. I started working from home in 1998.  Back in those days, there weren't many of us, but the demographic was growing by leaps and bounds every year. With the introduction of this amazing technology - the world wide web! - and all of its accouterments, many jobs that previously required actual bodies in office spaces, could suddenly be done remotely.  I researched and wrote a lot about it, and in fact, my original blog (happilyhome.blogspot) was born from a desire to assist other SAH parents in their search for a work-from-home life.What I found, back in those days, is still true today - maybe even more true - and that is that companies that allow part-time or full-time telecommuting options have a lower overhead (because they don't have to have as much real estate devoted to offices in which their personnel work) and in most cases, their employees have a better work/home life balance and are happier.   Even with that data freely available to anyone who was looking for it, many companies were still stuck in the 19th Century idea that employees needed to be watched, lest they slack off.  Fast forward twenty-two years, and out of necessity, many companies are sending their employees home.  I read an article recently that was discussing the changing nature of the publishing industry (sorry, I didn't save the link), and the gist of the article was that NYC would be the hub of publishing in name only, as much of the actual work would be performed remotely - often from out-of-state home offices. Maine has seen a huge migration of former New Yorkers, who are buying (cheaper) property here and telecommuting to their jobs in the city. Supporting a home-based workforce has some incredibly positive side effects: Less time off for sickness!  Keeping us healthy was (is) of course the primary motivator in adopting 2020s work-from-home paradigm, but it extends beyond the COVID crisis.  In the long-term, with fewer bodies in big office spaces, there is less opportunity for that winter flu to run through the work force.  As such, with fewer people falling ill, there will be a greater productivity, overall.  Hopefully, for that reason alone - this WAH life will prosper.Companies save money on real estate.  When I started my home-business twenty-two years ago, my first client was an out-of-state entrepreneur.  He was hoping to take advantage of the dot.com boom, and he was looking for a local person to be the administrative contact for this business idea he had.  He had some rental property in a very desirable area, and his idea was to use one of his rental units as an office space for his administrative assistant to run the business.  I talked him into allowing me to be a contractor rather than an employee and to use the office space and equipment I already had at my home.   The benefit, for him, was that I already had the equipment and the space, and so he didn't need to buy a computer or peripherals, AND that he could, now, rent the apartment.  The money he made off the rental funded his business venture and paid my contractor fee.  My home is much cleaner.  Which has no benefit for an employer, BUT is incredibly beneficial for my family ... which perhaps indirectly benefits an employer, because everyone is happier.  No commute is better for the environment.  When I quit my job at the theater in December to return to working full-time from home, I completely eliminated my daily commute.  I always use my credit card for gas purchases at the pump, like most folks.  On our most recent statement, I noted that I have filled up my gas tank twice since mid-December, and the last time I put gasoline in my car was January 5.  The environmental impact from reducing/eliminating the commutes of millions of people has proved incredibly (but not surprisingly) beneficial.  Working from home saves money.  I won't go into this one too much here/now, but suffice it to say that working from home, and/or having a full-time at home partner, saves a LOT of money in the long term.  The specifics are a book in the works ;).  Businesses are Supporting a Work-at-home WorkforceI was in Staples the other day, exchanging my CO2 cartridge (because we make our own seltzer with our SodaStream, which also saves us a lot of money), and I saw this pretty cool display.  The sign on the wall says, \"Build Your WFH Haven.\"  WFH is work from home.  Back in the day we called it telecommuting or work at home.  Telecommuters were people who had an employer who allowed them to work at home.  The WAH designation was for those who had home businesses or were independent contractors.I have been working from home for decades, and I have had half a dozen different configurations of a home office - everything from a plywood box-turned-desk in the dining room, to an executive computer desk with a hutch bookcase for storage in a dedicated \"office\" space, which could have qualified for a home-office tax deduction, if we had chosen to take it.  I could always get great supplies from Staples, but the fact is, they never catered to the work-from-home demographic.  Seeing those displays of ideas for setting up a work-at-home space was just so satisfying.  When I dissolved my business four years ago, we turned my former office space into a den/guest room with a sofa bed.  Currently, my WFH Haven is a bit more modest, but considering most of what I do is on my laptop, it's enough.  And I love how portable and streamlined my work space is.  My hope is to get a covered outdoor space so that I can work outside in the summer. Staples isn't the only corporation that has turned its sights on the WAH workforce.  There have also been some businesses that have taken a page from Mr. Bigweld (from the animated feature, Robots) - \"see a need, fill a need.\"  While virtual office space probably did exist pre-COVID (I have had my share of Skype interviews and meetings), companies like Google with \"Google Meet\" and Zoom, have made it possible and fairly easy to have virtual meetings.  Delivery services, like UPS and FedEx, are making bank.  I see a UPS and/or FedEx truck on my road (I live on a dirt road with six other residences - one that is vacant) every day.   And then, there are the businesses that have always offered services that we ... or maybe it's just me ... never looked for, because we didn't know we needed it.  Did you know that the USPS offers prepaid, pre-addressed flat rate envelopes?  Well, I didn't!  And I wouldn't have gone looking for that service, if I didn't want to *not* have to go into the post office.  The envelopes are the perfect size for sending a book.  I received my envelopes the other day, put in my book, wrote the recipients' address in the spot provided, and dropped it into a convenient mail box.  I actually wish I had known about the service years ago, when I was sending out a lot more books.  It was so much easier and faster than standing in the line at the post office, and while I like most of the folks behind the counter, sometimes the whole experience has been draining and very unsatisfactory, for me.  And the best part - the postage is \"forever\" - like the Forever Stamps.  So, if the cost of the bulk rate envelopes goes up before I use the ones I ordered, I get the lower postage price.  Sometimes it's good to stock up ;).The Entrepreneurial Spirit has flourishedWhile there are so many very sad stories about businesses that have suffered and shuttered due to the pandemic, I have also seen an equal number of businesses that have adapted in some pretty exciting and amazing ways. The whole take-out industry is pretty exciting, for an introvert, like me.  Deus Ex Machina and I used to eat out frequently (a few times per month, at least), and when I say \"eat out\", what I mean is that we would do take-out.  I like to eat dinner in my pajamas and enjoy a nice glass of my favorite red wine with my meal.  Unfortunately, for us, we don't do fast food, and the kinds of places from which we wanted to order our dinner, usually catered to people who were dining in.  Our take-out food was not as carefully considered as our meal would have been had we stayed in the restaurant.  Things have changed a little, and those restaurants are adapting to a much greater volume of people who want their food to go.  People, like me, who don't want the hassle of having to put on pants to eat dinner,  are the unintended beneficiaries of this new dining paradigm.  The delivery services, like Uber Eats and Door Dash, are also a nice bonus.  We've owned our house for two decades and before the pandemic we couldn't even pay for delivery - not even Dominos or Papa Johns, which specialize in delivery service, delivered here.  I mean, it's not like we live on the top of Mt. Katahdin, for heck's sake, but for some reason, no one would deliver to our neighborhood.  Being able to have food delivered was a pleasant change. No contact, curb side pick-up where one orders on line or over the phone, pays, and then, drives to the store, where they put it in the trunk or the backseat is next best thing to home delivery.  I sincerely hope that it will remain a thing after this is all over.  I have also seen a whole industry emerge as a result of the pandemic.  Individuals who possess the heretofore underappreciated skill of sewing, are earning a nice income making masks.  I applaud their entrepreneurial spirit - see a need, fill a need.  I have also seen businesses adapt their entire business model.  Hyperlite, which made ultra light backpacking and camping gear pre-COVID, kept their facilities up and running by transitioning into mask making. A local distillery started making hand sanitizer when their tasting rooms were shut down and they couldn't sell their booze.  Several wholesale companies that had previously served the restaurant industry started offering their services to individuals - like me.  Native Maine now offers home delivery of a variety of grocery items.  I am a very happy customer of theirs.  I can buy 5 lbs of locally roasted ground coffee for about $6/lb.  That's cheaper than what I pay for a regional coffee at the grocery store.  We drink a lot of coffee.  The cost savings is big.A local seafood wholesaler is offering weekly \"pop-ups\" at which we can purchase seafood products at the price restaurants pay.  We have to buy in bulk quantities, but hey, I have no problem with vacuum sealing 35 lbs of haddock on a Friday evening.  That's 35 lbs of awesome Atlantic white fish in my freezer.  Prepping has become mainstreamLast August I wrote a blog post about having a difficult time getting my chickens scheduled to go the butcher.  In 2020 more people were home more hours than they had ever been, and the thing that many of them decided to do with their extra time was, basically, what we preppers have been doing for years: gardening, raising livestock (like chickens), canning, stocking up on food and supplies, DIY home improvements. Seeds every where were suddenly out of stock.  By mid-April, here in my local area, every place that sold baby chicks had sold out.  Even Amazon.com was out of canning supplies.  Forget trying to get them locally! Grocery shelves were empty of canned goods and non-perishable long storage foods, like pasta, yeast, and flour.The home improvement stores were deemed \"essential businesses\" and had lines of people waiting to go into the stores - I was in a few of those lines, more than once.   As I do every year around this time, I'm placing my chick order and looking at what we might order for seeds.  I think after the shortages last year, a lot of people will be planning earlier, too.I don't think people are suddenly thinking that we, preppers, have all the answers, and I don't, for a second, think that, for most people, it will become a lifestyle.  I think most people will happily return to their pre-COVID, non-prepping ways once the masks come off and they can go back to on-demand service for whatever their hearts desire.But I think for enough of us, this pandemic is a small taste of what could happen to change, forever, the world as we know it, and those people will be the ones who find new and exciting ways to ensure their future is comfortable - no matter what that future holds. While we, preppers, may not be completely accepted, at least we're not being ridiculed and dismissed these days.  In fact, we are, at least in this article, being celebrated.  I also think that the pandemic has created a few SAH moms and dads of people who never imagined that they could or even wanted to stay home full-time.  There was another article that I skimmed and didn't save.  The gist was, basically, to discuss how mothers have been the unwitting victims of this  pandemic with regard to their careers/income potential (i.e. the pandemic has worsened the gender wage gap), because women are the ones losing or leaving their (thankless, low paying) jobs to come home and be with their virtual-schooling children.  I mean ... as a two decade stay-at-home/work-at-home Mom and an eighteen year homeschool veteran, I'm not seeing the downside to this.  The idea, for me, is very exciting, because I know, from personal experience, that being home full-time benefits my family and myself in innumerable ways:  financially, professionally, and spiritually.  My hope is that the stigma around having a full-time at home parent/partner will be decreased, because we, as a society, will discover that being home is not a bad thing, after all.People are getting healthier  The pandemic, especially early on here in Maine, spurred a huge interest in getting outdoors and walking.  I mean, that was really one of the only activities that was permitted outside of one's home, and so, of course, everyone was out there.  People are still getting out and walking more, which is a good thing. I would also posit that people are eating better, because more people are cooking at home and are learning how to actually cook using whole foods and not just pre-packaged mixes and processed foods.  I had an old high school friend who posted a video of this woman who was making macaroni salad.  It was the best cooking video I've seen since I watched Julia Child as a youngster.  The woman was just so easy-going about the whole process, and I tell you, at the end, I just really wanted pasta salad. My friend was talking about starting a YouTube channel on which she would just cook old timey kinds of meals, and I hope she does.  I would be excited to share her videos, because cooking is not hard or complicated, and preparing wholesome, tasty meals doesn't require a culinary degree.    People had the courage to leave or at least consider leaving dead-end jobs/careersIf 2020 taught us one thing, it's that life is too short and too precious to live it doing activities that rob us of our joy.  Someone very dear to me lost his job due to the pandemic.  He was out of work for most of the year, which actually ended up being a very good thing for him and his family.  Being home full-time gave him an opportunity to do some soul-searching, and what he discovered during those long months of hanging out with his wife and kids, and going for lots of hikes, and planting a garden in their new home, and just being, was that he did not want to return to the high stress and long hours of his former career.  He was able to secure a new job at his same pay level with better hours and a lot less headache.  It was a happy ending, but he would never have looked for that particular job, if his old career hadn't been taken from him.Another friend had worked at a job that she didn't love for more years than she had ever intended.  Her job was discontinued during the pandemic, because her employer had to go virtual, and hers was not a virtual sort of job.  She was employed for some piece work stuff, but mostly, she didn't have a job or an income.  Except, she did.  For a while, she had been working this part-time side gig, and as luck had it, the side gig turned into a full-time permanent thing.  She was able to leave the job that was paying the bills, but robbing her of her spark, and do work that gave her life value and meaning.While the news is full of the stories of tragedy and loss, what I'm hearing on the street is that people have discovered passions they didn't know they had, and this pandemic has allowed people to take a long, hard look at where they were, and where they want to go.  Another loved one is planning a late-life complete career change, and I am so excited to see where it takes him.  And on a personal level, Deus Ex Machina and I realized that my outside the home job was not enriching our lives in any measurable way. The money I earned wasn't greater than what we could save if I were home full-time.  The pandemic gave me the permission I needed to leave the job and come back home to do what gave my life meaning and purpose.I didn't rejoice at the end of 2020, and frankly, I don't hold out a lot of hope that 2021 is going to be so significantly more positive than 2020 was - unless we step back and take a look at the things that made 2020 not so terrible, because those will be the same things that make 2021 good."},
{"title": "Creating a Sewing Pattern", "date": "Friday, January 15, 2021", "text": "What's better than being able to repair or alter clothes?I think I've mentioned the fact that I had to take Home Ec. in school, and it was in that class that I learned to sew.  While I credit Home Ec, and Mrs. Abraham with teaching me to sew, the fact is that I started sewing many years before that.  When I was six, I was a Brownie Girl Scout, and I learned an embroidery technique for embellishing cloth napkins.  I also learned a very valuable lesson when I witnessed one of our scout leaders who had sewed her embroidered napkin to her skirt.  In the seventh grade, as a Cadette Girl Scout, I learned how to hand sew using several different stiches, including a blind stitch for sewing hems.  My Girl Scout troop elected to make our own uniforms, and our troop leader instructed us in using a pattern and sewing that pattern together by hand to make a wrap-around skirt.  I finished my skirt during the HBO free weekend, sitting in front of the television and binge watching movies I would never see on TV in their unedited form, and which I couldn't afford to go see at the theater.  We were binge watching television before Netflix was a thing.  Just sayin'.The six years in between learning embroidery and sewing my skirt, I made a lot of doll clothes and pillows.  So, while my high school Home Ec. class deserves the credit for teaching me to be comfortable with a sewing machine, it wasn't the fuel that sparked my interest in making things using a needle and thread.  That fire was started many years before I was even thinking about high school.Fast forward a lot of years, and sewing has become a happy past-time, for me - not something that I do for enjoyment, but something I *can* do, and mostly, enjoy.  The part that I enjoy the most is the ability to fill a need.  Like making masks.  We needed masks.  I disliked the idea of disposable options (not only do I hate the notion of using something that is meant to be thrown away, but I also just hate the way they look), and so I made my own.  Deus Ex Machina has been wearing the cloth masks I made for him since April 2020, when his employer first mandated them.  He received lots of compliments and comments about the fabric choices, and the recycled elastics ;).  And that's the second bonus, for me.  If I can reuse something to make something new that we need, it's a win-win.Such was the case with Deus Ex Machina's undergarments.The story is that he had some tee-shirts that were still perfectly usable, but he was no longer able to wear them.  They were a custom garment, and so we also couldn't donate them.  The choice was to throw them away, or find an other use. I found another use.  A couple of his old tee-shirts became skirts, for me.  I made this skirt using a pattern I had purchased.  But then, I noticed he had some undergarments that weren't in the best shape, and since I was already sewing, I thought, \"I can make those.\"Unfortunately, I didn't have a pattern.So I made one.Et voila!Boxer briefs that were the perfect fit and were free!  I even reused the elastic from an old pair of briefs.It doesn't get much better than that.How to Create a Sewing Pattern:1.  Disassemble an article of clothing that is the same size and style that you are hoping to create.2.  Trace the shape of the individual pieces on to butcher paper.  Note: it's not necessary to use any special paper, but it is helpful if the piece of paper is large enough to hold the entire piece of cloth.  That is, taping sheets of printer paper together would work, but the tape might get in the way.3.  Label the pieces of the pattern and indicate any special instructions - like how many of that size piece are needed (cut 2), or if the piece can be placed on a fold and cut out.4.  Sew the pieces together."},
{"title": "The Economy of Women's Work", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2021", "text": "Any woman worth her salt hates that phrase, and most of the women I know will hate me for using it. Hate might be too strong a word, but the fact is, many of us bristle at the notion that there is \"women's work\" and \"men's work.\"  The unfortunate reality of our culture and our world is that there are tasks - daily tasks, even; necessary, tasks that, if they don't get done, could actually mean the difference between life and death - that are often undervalued and dubbed \"women's work.\"Like cooking meals, which is by and large considered women's work.  Unless one is a famous chef who makes fancy food and yells at people on television.  THEN, cooking is okay for a man to do.  But the daily task of feeding people is usually a job relegated to the Mom. I was never going to be a stay-at-home mom. In fact, I went to college, because I never wanted to be dependent on anyone for financial security.And then, that all changed.  I still don't like being financially dependent, but over the course of the decades that Deus Ex Machina and I have been married, and that I have been a homemaker, I have learned a few things about the economy of having a full-time stay-at-home partner.My efforts haven't always been appreciated by the greater world, and I can tell lots of stories in which I am featured as a lesser person, and my value as a contributing member of my family is seen as worth much less than my husband, who has a job making money. That's the problem with our society, though, this emphasis, the NEED, for everyone to MAKE money.  I could tell lots of stories about times when I was made to feel worth *less* than other women who work and less than my husband, but I won't tell those stories - today.Today, I want to tell you the story of a pair of pants.Deus Ex Machina is not a suit and tie kind of guy.  He likes a no-fuss wardrobe made up of good quality clothing, preferably comprised of items that just appeared in his drawer. He hates shopping almost as much as he hates having to wear fancy clothes.I have had some negative experiences of buying clothes for other adults, and so, in the early stages of our relationship, I was a little gun-shy about buying pants and shirts for him, but he made it super easy for me.  Being in the military was perfect for him, because he never had to fuss about his clothes.  He had a uniform.  Over the years, since leaving military service, he has embraced the idea of a uniform in his daily work attire.  He likes this one style of pants in a light, earth tone (preferably tan or khaki), and he likes this one style of shirt, in black.  He has multiple pairs of tan cargo pants and a half dozen black, polo-style shirts.  It's what he wears to work every day, and it makes getting dressed super easy.  Tan pants.  Black polo shirt.  Work boots.  The only decision he has to make about what he's wearing is socks and underwear.  As a funny aside: We never thought much about his \"uniform\" look and how other people might see it, until he heard, through the grapevine, that one of his colleagues had expressed some concern about his private life.  The story is that, since he didn't appear to be changing clothes, this person thought he might be having some trouble at home and was sleeping in his car.That story was almost as good as the one about the colleague who wanted to take up a collection at work to purchase a television for us, because she found out that we didn't have one, and she thought we didn't have a television, because we couldn't afford to buy one.  I mean, why else would we not have a television, right?People are funny.Anyway, I was talking about pants.Deus Ex Machina has a half dozen or so pairs of this exact same style of pants.  Like most things, eventually, they start to show some wear, and a couple of the pairs started fraying around the hem.  The good news is that we bought them a little long, and also that I have both the skill and the equipment to make repairs to clothes.  That is, I have a sewing machine, and I know how to use it.We could probably afford to purchase another pair for him, but the fact is that there was nothing wrong with those pants except that the hem was fraying, and so it just makes zero sense to relegate those pants as yardwork pants, and purchase a new pair, when there is nothing wrong with them except the hem.  But he can't wear them to work like that.So I fixed them. FixedThere might be some Super Women out there who are good at both - who are able to do as that 1970s perfume commercial jingle says - \"I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and never ... let you forget you're a man.\"  But given our disposable culture and the number of young people who don't have basic home making skills, my guess is that most women who work full-time don't spend their off-work time mending their husband's clothes.  It's not a judgment.  It's just to say that, because we chose this lifestyle and Deus Ex Machina has the luxury of having an at-home wife, he also is afforded the privilege of spending less money on clothes.He likes spending less money.And because I repaired his pants, rather than buying a new pair, I saved us $65.  Having a full-time homemaker was a very conscious decision for us.  We opted to earn less money, than maybe we were both capable of earning, because we wanted to live in Maine, where potential earnings in his career field are less than he could have earned in other parts of the country, and because we wanted to cultivate a certain lifestyle.  We wanted our children to be raised by their parents rather than by under appreciated and poorly paid childcare providers.  We wanted the option of homeschooling.  Because Deus Ex Machina had me at home to, literally and figuratively, tend the home fires, he was able to grow his career; he was able to travel for work whenever necessary without worrying about who was taking care of the hearth and home; he was able to learn some new skills (like taking flight lessons and guitar lessons) that he might not have been able to pursue, if he had needed to accommodate my work schedule.And because I am home full-time, we are able to be more economical in our lifestyle choices, which, in reality, gives us far more money in cost savings than I would earn if I had a job, even a job using my teaching degree (especially after subtracting the cost of having said job). The added bonus is that, while my on-paper income is a lot less than what my wages would look like - on paper - if I had a full-time job outside of the home, between the income I do earn in wages doing part-time contract work and what I save by doing much of what other people pay to have done for them, I am earning a lot more.There are some huge benefits to having a full-time at-home partner.  The least of which is that buying new clothes can happen a lot less frequently than, perhaps, in the average two-income family. Mother's Helper"},
{"title": "Living the Locavore Life", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2021", "text": "Over a decade ago, I started working toward localizing our diet.  We never achieved 100% local, 100% of the time, but at this point, every meal that we prepare here at home has something local.  For instance, tonight will be chicken tenders (using chicken we raised ourselves) with roasted potatoes (local potatoes) and a salad (not local lettuce, but the dressing is homemade using local ingredients).  Depending on the time of year, the entire meal might be local (sometimes all from our own nanofarm) - a fact we don't even think much about ... until we think about it (like thinking about where tonight's menu items originated).We started our journey toward an all local diet at the beginning of the locavore movement, and our search for local foods coincided with our local supermarket's answering the call for more local goods to be available to a wider market.  As the years past, we found that most what was available in our local food shed had become available at our local supermarket - all with handy labels that identified the items that were \"close to home.\"  It couldn't have been easier.  So, between shopping at the supermarket, direct purchases from local farmers, what we grew ourselves, and foraging, we have been able to enjoy many meals where everything was local, without having to really scrounge for local ingredients.  We just bought local food at the supermarket, and that's what we ate.Unfortunately, the last year has done a lot to change how I shop.  Mostly, I really hate going to the grocery store, and I have been looking for alternatives.  I've tried a few online shopping sites.  I like Thrive Market**, because their products are mostly organic, but there are so many things that I couldn't buy from them (like fresh produce and dairy), and they don't deal in food that is local to me.  So, transitioning to buying all of my groceries through Thrive wasn't going to happen.  **If you use this link to go to their site and shop, I will get a referral bonus - just FYI ;).  There is a local dairy that contracts with a milk delivery guy.  I tried to get on their delivery list, but I was too late.  They didn't have any slots open, and there was no indication of when they would have any availability for delivering to my area.I kept looking, though, and recently, I discovered a company that carries a lot of Maine-based and regional products.  The company is Native Maine.  I think they used to only serve restaurants and grocery stores, but at some point, recently, they started offering home delivery service - and they will deliver to me ... next day delivery!  They carry just shy of 200 Maine-based and regional products, including Pineland cheese and Fox Family chips - both of which regularly appear in my kitchen.  I can also get half&half (for our coffee) and milk from them, if I want.I just placed my first order with them, and from this initial experience it looks like between them and what we can get from local farmers and/or grow on our own property, there are very few things that we have to find elsewhere (mostly snack kinds of foods that my daughters want, pet food, toiletries, and cleaning supplies), which means, perhaps, my trips to the grocery store can be few and far between - a fact which thrills me!  The best part is that I don't have to compromise my hard won Locavore diet just so that I can avoid having to go shopping, and as an additional bonus, I discovered that Native Maine carries both a local brand of peanut butter and a local brand of coffee.  I ordered extra of both ;).Has the pandemic changed your shopping habits and/or food choices?    **Photo credit here"},
{"title": "Paying Homage to My Well-Stocked Pantry", "date": "Friday, January 8, 2021", "text": "There is a common dialogue in my house.  It goes something, like this.Me:  What do you want for dinner?Deus Ex Machina:  Yes.Either that, or he'll say something with pasta.  I'm okay with pasta, but pasta, for me, is not the quick, easy meal prep that Deus Ex Machina thinks it is.  First off, it takes a lot of dishes to prepare, then, there's the actual prep time involved, because I don't just boil some noodles, dump on a jar of sauce, and call it good.  I want meatballs with my spaghetti, and for that, I have to make meatballs, which take a lot of time, and I usually cook my meatballs before I add them to my sauce.  So - even more time.  And dishes!Or I want a baked Mac & Cheese, which means I need to: boil pasta (large saucepan or kettle and a colander), grate cheese (cheese grater), make a cheese sauce (small sauce pan), cube bread (cutting board and knife), brown Italian sausage, and mix everything in a baking pan and bake.  If you're keeping that's two sauce pans, a colander, a skillet, the cheese grater, a cutting board and knife, and a baking dish.  My sink is now full of dirty dishes, and that doesn't even include the plates we eat on or the utensils we eat with.  I love to cook.  I hate doing dishes.  The real issue is that on those days when I am asking what other people want for dinner, what I'm saying is, \"I'm wiped out today - for whatever reason - and I can't think about what I should make for dinner, because I can't even think about what color socks I should put on my feet, and so I am asking for your help in picking something SUPER EASY and fast that I can whip up in about ten minutes.\"  Or, I might be asking for take-out.  Either works.Unfortunately, I don't usually articulate it in that way.  I just ask for ideas, but then, I end up making whatever I want anyway, which is why the conversation has evolved.  I still ask, but recently, the conversation has gone more like:Me:  What do you want for dinner?Deus Ex Machina:  Yes.Me:  Chili it is. A friend recently posted some of the lessons she learned in the 2020 Pandemic.  The biggest thing I learned is that I love the life that I had been building, and my ultimate goal was to get back to that way of life - working from home blogging/writing, homesteading/homemaking, tending the home and hearth.  There's a theme here.  For me, life is about making a home.  Those are the things that feed my soul and make me feel necessary.  We all like feeling necessary, don't we?I also learned that I have an amazing pantry and that I'm a pretty decent cook (in spite of what my son once told me, and which has become a running joke in my family).  Just about any thing I want to eat, I can make - cheaper and tastier than I can get carry out. My fresh from scratch version is often better than the prepared version from the grocery store, too.  Like my homemade ramen.  I use store-bought ramen or rice noodles, but everything else, including the seasoning, is from my pantry.  The broth for this ramen was made from leftover roast chicken.My daughter loves hummus.  She was coming over for dinner during the holidays, and I thought I would surprise her by making some hummus.  I had everything I needed to make the simple, five ingredient dip:  garbanzo beans, garlic, sesame oil, lemon juice, and salt.  That's it.  It was delicious, and she appreciated that I made it - just for her.  That's the benefit of having a well-stocked pantry.  Food is so integral to our human communal experience.  There are special dishes associated with every major holiday.  When people get together, it's food that we share, along with our company and our stories.  Being able to offer a hearty, tasty meal makes me happy.Two nights ago, Deus Ex Machina and I had our usual dinner discussion.  I was looking for ideas on that particular evening.  I wanted chili, but we were low on tortilla chips, which we all like in our chili, and so I didn't want to make that.  But I had ground beef in the refrigerator, and so whatever I made, it would have ground meat in it. Meatballs and meatloaf are time consuming.I didn't want pasta.Anything Tex-Mex was out, because of the above-mentioned tortilla chip shortage.So, I consulted my google cookbook, and I found a recipe for a Japanese dish called Soboro Donburi (I used this recipe).  Donburi means \"something served over steamed rice as a bowl.\"  Soboro is a dish with ground meat (and since making the above version with ground beef, I have seen other recipes with the same name that use something other ground meats, like chicken and pork). The recipe I used called for five ingredients, and I was SO excited to see that I had all five of them:  ground meat, soy sauce (or Tamari, for us, since we're gluten-free), ginger (of which I have a ton, thanks to my Misfits Market subscription), sugar, and frozen peas.  I was actually worried that I didn't have any peas, but in the back of the freezer, under some frozen blueberries, was a bag.  Huzzah!Me:  What do you want for dinner?Deus Ex Machina:  Yes.Me:  Soboro Donburi it is!And it was, and it was DELICIOUS!  Have you ever made something that turned out so good that  you wanted it the next night, too?  That was this dish.  It was so easy and so tasty, I almost made it the next night, too.I don't like fussy meals with lots of exotic ingredients, but what I'm finding is that what used to feel like exotic ingredients to me are now mainstays in my kitchen - like ginger and garlic and sesame oil.  I have an enviable spice cabinet.  The pandemic taught me that I like cooking.  That I prefer eating at home.  That there are very few meals I can purchase as take-out that are as ethically sourced (with regard to ingredients) and tasty as what I can make at home - for a lot less money.  The pandemic also taught me that I can maintain my well-stocked pantry with a lot fewer trips to the grocery store, but also that if I look more deeply into the backs of those cabinets, I will find exactly what I need to make whatever I'm craving.  If you don't do anything else for yourself, this year, build your pantry.  Here are some tips:1.  Sit down with your family and think of ten meals that you frequently prepare or purchase as take-out.  This isn't a \"make a menu\" recommendation.  Personally, the weekly menu thing has never worked for me, because invariably on Taco Tuesday, I don't want tacos, or something similar.  Props to those people who can do it.  It's just not me.2.  Find a recipe for those meals.   I grew up believing that those terrible, square packs of instant ramen were actually what \"ramen\" is.  Then, we went to an actual ramen restaurant, and I had \"real\" ramen.  I liked it so much, I thought, \"I need to learn to make that!\"  And I did, and it was amazing.  I keep rice noodles in my pantry now, so that when we want something like ramen, I can make it.3.  Make an ingredient list.  Way back, before I really learned how to actually cook, I was under the mistaken belief that spice packets - like taco seasoning - contained some fancy and/or mysterious ingredients that I couldn't just purchase.  At some point, I figured it out.  My three youngest daughters grew up with my own way of seasoning taco meat.  Big Little Sister learned to season tacos by the way the taco meat looks when it's properly seasoned using spices in my (and now her own) cabinets.  If you're interested, taco seasoning, for me, is just: chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, sometimes onion powder, and dried cilantro.  I haven't bought taco seasoning packets in, probably, twenty years. All of those spices that go into my taco meat can be used for other dishes, as well.My family LOVES ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, we're almost out, but I'm not due to go to the grocery for another week - if I want to adhere to my bi-monthly shopping trips.  So, I looked for a recipe for ranch dressing, and guess what?  I have all of the ingredients in this recipe, except buttermilk.  Instead, I will use half&half (because we love coffee and we always have half&half or real cream in the refrigerator for our coffee) and some lemon juice, which we also usually have (because I use it in canning and food preservation).  P.S.  Several of the spices that go in the taco seasoning are also used in the ranch dressing.  Life is grand that way ;).4.  Look at what you have in your pantry right now and make either a written inventory or a mental list.5.  Based on those meals that your family most enjoys, make a list of ingredients that you don't have and/or that you are low on. 6.  List in hand, go to the grocery store.  7.  Be sure to buy some snack foods.  You know you will want them, and it's better just to buy the chocolate bar at the lower grocery store price than to sneak over to the 7-11 later for that over priced Snickers bar.Helpful hints:When you're building your pantry, you will want to have more than one meal's worth of most things.  Buy two cans of tomatoes, even if you think you'll only use one.  Those cans of tomatoes will be fine in your cabinet for a couple of years, and you will use it, eventually.  Buy extra.Multi-purpose items or \"ingredients\" are better than processed products (see taco seasoning example above).  Once you start learning to use the ingredients, you can start learning to produce your own ingredients.  There's nothing quite so satisfying as making a meal with food YOU grew.  While all home-cooked, all the time is a noble goal, we all have days when we.just.can't.  Be gentle with yourself on those days, open up the freezer, and grab the tater tots and Freschetta cheese pizza.  It's okay.  No one is judging."},
{"title": "Low Tech Kitchen", "date": "Thursday, December 17, 2020", "text": "I'll be honest.  I don't like doing the dishes.  It is my least favorite household chore.  When my children were younger and we were still homeschooling, there was a lot of eating happening at my house.   Way back, Deus Ex Machina worked close enough to home that he was able to have lunch with us.  Three meals a day for five people.  Even today, for the most part, we eat most of our meals here at home (and our grocery bill shows it!).  I make breakfast for Deus Ex Machina before he goes to work every day; Deus Ex Machina takes lunch (usually leftovers) from home; if my daughters have the day off, they make their own breakfast and lunch here at home, and I make dinner every night for the four adults who still live here.If I weren't careful, all that eating at home would generate a mountain of dishes, and in the past, it had.  To combat that potentiality, everyone has his/her own plate, bowl, and mug.  We use jars for glasses.  I used to have a bunch of kitchen appliances, too.  I had a bread maker, but we didn't like the cubes of bread, and so I started making bread by hand.  My favorite was one-hour French bread, which, literally, took an hour and baked on a cookie sheet or the pizza stone - not in a bread pan.  I had a food processor until the motor burned out, and I never replaced it.  I had a pasta maker, which was cool, but then, we went gluten free, and by the time I learned to make gluten free pasta, I no longer had the pasta maker. The problem with all of those amazing appliances is that they take up a lot of space.  None of my appliances had a home on my counters, because I only have a very tiny amount of counter space.  So, before I could even use them, I needed to make room for them on the counter, and then, get the appliance out of its hidey-hole.  Additionally, while they might cut the prep time down, they increase the clean-up time.  It takes a lot less time and effort to wash a bowl and the cutting board than it does to deal with the bread maker - wait for it to cool off, wash and dry the pan and the paddle, and then, put it all away.  I still have to clean the bowl, cutting board (for kneading), and pan when I bake bread by hand, but everything just takes less time, for me, and there's no bulky appliance to deal with.The other issue, to which I have already alluded, is that I have a very tiny kitchen with no drawers and only a few cabinets.  Space is at a premium, and I just can't afford to have things that only serve a single purpose and are only used intermittently.  As such, I have learned to do a lot of things with very simple tools.  Like peeling carrots.  In the 20+ years that Deus Ex Machina and I have been married, I have never owned a carrot peeler.  I use a knife.  It works just fine.  Granted a carrot peeler is small and doesn't take up space, but having a few really good, sharp, paring knives work just as well, and I can use them for other things, too.  Like slicing the carrots after I've peeled them.  One tool.  Two jobs.  I have a hand mixer, but for a lot of things, I've found that mixing with a wood spoon works just as well.  No need to pull out the electric appliance, find the mixer blades, plug it in, whip the potatoes, disassemble the machine, wash the paddles, and put everything away.  Instead, I just get the wooden spoon and whip the potatoes by hand.  Then, I use the same spoon to stir in the butter, and to serve the potatoes.  One tool.  Three jobs.  The other day I posted a list of last minute, hand-made Christmas gifts.  One of them was a DIY seed sprouter using a repurposed glass jar.  The one I used was a Classico pasta sauce jar. I like those jars, because the jar lid is the same size as a regular mouth mason jar.  In fact, the jars Classico uses are \"mason\" brand jars.  I reuse the jars for everything from drinking glasses to canning ... and now seed sprouting.It actually works pretty well for seed sprouting.  I still have my Bioset sprouter, and I will still use it, until it breaks, which it will, and when that happens, it will be nice to know that I have an alternative, that won't take up any more space in my kitchen, and uses something that I already have in abundance.What are your favorite low-tech kitchen tools for which everyone else has a fancy alternative?"},
{"title": "Here's to All You New Preppers", "date": "Tuesday, December 15, 2020", "text": "I saw an article this morning.  The headline was \"Maine Fireplace Businesses See Boost Amid Pandemic.\"  Much of the article is focused on the fact that due to the pandemic more homeowners and businesses are investing in outdoor heating.  Here in Maine, heat is necessary, of course, and since there are restrictions regarding indoor gathering, restaurants are trying to adapt to stay in business.But there was also a section of the article that focused on home heating, with the comment that \"more people are staying home and doing projects.\"Well ... maybe people are trying to make their homes more pleasant by adding a fireplace.And maybe, like so many of us in the prepper world have mentioned - a few times ... and then a few more - being prepared to live without electricity and other \"modern\" conveniences is not a bad idea.  The worst thing that will happen is, there's a nice fire in the fireplace to take the chill off and help save a few dollars in heating costs during the winter.  The best thing is, if the power goes out, there's a way to heat one's home.The Organic Prepper published an article recently by J.G. Martinez, who survived the economic and social collapse in Venezuela.  Mr. Martinez writes about the four things he wished he had known prior to experiencing that collapse.  The first is about supplies, and it's very much what many preppers have been recommending.  Skills are better than things.  Ingredients are better than items.  For instance, knowing how to source and purify water could, in reality, be a life saver.  Knowing how to make soap from wood ash (to make lye) and animal fat is superior to storing a dozen bars of Ivory soap.  The reason, as Mr. Martinez points out, is that those bars of soap will run out, because the emergency will likely last longer than you anticipated.So, the fireplace article was interesting, and I wonder how many of those people who have been having fireplaces and woodstoves installed or updated in recent months have done so because they are starting to see something unsettling in what's happening in our world. If any of you are new to the prepping scene, welcome!  Please feel free to ask questions.  Either I, or one of my regular readers, probably knows the answer :)."},
{"title": "Five Last Minute Gifts from the Homestead", "date": "Tuesday, December 8, 2020", "text": "I am notoriously bad at holiday gift buying.  The fact is that I don't really like to shop, especially these days.  I get overwhelmed at the store - at all stores, really, especially when I am trying to shop for someone else.  I'm just not very good at it.  There are too many choices, and most of it just costs too much.  The truth is, I would rather give homemade gifts, anyway.  With a homemade gift, I have to spend time thinking about what I can make for THAT person, and price is never the final consideration, because a lot of the time - most of the time, really - when I'm making a homemade gift, it will be from things I have here at my house already.I am actually quite thankful that I never fell into the Marie Kondo lifestyle.  While I do appreciate the idea of clutter-free, I also value the ability to make what I need from what I have.  The ability to do so is the basis of preparedness.Sometimes, though, I need inspiration.  I need ideas on things I could make.  One of the problems, for me, with most of the articles featuring homemade gift ideas is that the gifts are usually food centric, personal hygiene items, or are tchotchke-kinds of gifts - especially the ones that upcycle or repurpose materials.  Those are all great things, except ...These days, giving food is challenging.  Everyone has some dietary restriction or choice that limits what can be made for them. In just my family, we have vegans, locavores, several gluten-free folks, and a couple of people who don't eat sugar.  It's the same deal for personal hygiene items.  Bath bombs would be great ... if I took baths.  I don't.  Most of the people I know don't.  Most of us shower.  I also have very sensitive skin, and I'm particular about the soap I use.  So, fancy soaps or bath additives just don't work.  As for trinkets, honestly, I have absolutely no use for a snow globe made out of a baby food jar, and while that snowman made from an old pair of socks is wicked cute, for me, it just takes up space on my bookshelves that could be used for books.  Since I wouldn't give something that I wouldn't use, most of the usual suggestions don't work, for me.  So, I tried to come up with some things that I would use, that I could also make.  Here's my list:Storage BoxesI actually adore storage boxes, baskets, and little wooden crates.  What I don't love is how much they cost, especially given that the storage boxes one can get at the craft store these days are made of cardboard.  Just like a shoebox, right?I've been keeping shoeboxes, because they're great for storage, and I thought, what a fun gift to cover the boxes in a snazzy paper.  One could use old maps, sheet music, pages from magazines or old catalogs, construction paper, actual wrapping paper, pages from old books, etc.  I mean, the possibilities are pretty limitless with regard to what one uses to cover the box. For my box, I used some fancy scrapbooking paper.  I used regular old Elmer's glue and a paint brush.  Worked great.  Here are a couple of finished boxes.  These are mine.  If I were doing it for someone else, I would probably take a little more care to smooth everything out and take care where I put the seams.Tin Can SafeBack on my old blog, I wrote an article about hiding valuables in plain sight.  The idea is that most people take things at face value.  That's the idea behind this gift.  It's just another can in the pantry, right? Making this item requires a can opener that slices open the side of the lid rather than opening the top.  The lid will, then, fit back down on the can, and depending on how often one opens it, it could be sealed with a little bit of glue or rubber cement.  Book SafeIn keeping with the hide-in-plain-sight theme, this gift can be a good place to store valuables.  Most people don't even look at the books on the shelf.  Making the book safe takes a bit longer than the others, because it takes time for the glue to dry.  For this project, just find an old hard cover book, glue all of the pages together (for this book, I used a spray on glue, but regular white glue brushed on with a paint brush or even a glue stick would also work really well), cut out the center, et, voila!  Book safe.  For a really special gift, it might be fun to find an ironic title, like Treasure Island or The Hiding Place.  Seed SprouterI love sprouts, especially during the winter when I don't have fresh greens in the garden.  Sure, I can purchase lettuce at the store for salads, and I do, occasionally, but it's also nice to be able to make a salad with sprouts from my own kitchen. I have this sprouter from Johnny Seed, but just a jar with a lid would work just as well.  This jar was from marinara sauce.  I just punched holes in the lid using a finishing nail.  One could also drill holes in the lid.  Then, I put a piece of cheese cloth over the jar and attached the lid.  The cheese cloth will keep the small seeds from dropping out of the openings in the lid.  I added a tablespoon of seeds and filled the jar about halfway with water.  I probably added too much water, but it doesn't really matter.  What matters is: 1.  the seeds get wet; 2. the water is completely drained.   I had to shake the the jar to get the water out, and then, I laid the jar on its side on the counter.  I will add water to the jar, and then, drain the water every day.  I should have sprouts big enough to eat in three days.If one were to add some seed packets (radish, broccoli, alfalfa, clover, kale, mung bean), it would be a lovely gift for a friend who wants to get into sprouting, but isn't 100% committed to the idea.  It will give him/her a chance to see if he/she likes sprouting before investing in a fancy (read: expensive) set up.Oven Mitt/Pot HolderI taught a sewing class at my homeschool co-op one tri-mester.  The first project we tackled was oven mitts.  It couldn't be simpler.  I used an old pair of blue jeans and an old towel.  I traced around my hand in a mitten shape.  I cut out two of each material for one mitt.  The blue jeans are on the outside and the towel serves as an extra insulative layer inside the mitt.    I sewed each towel layer to the blue jean layer.  With right sides together, I sewed the blue jean layers together, and then, turned the whole thing inside out.  I used one of the belt loops for the loop to hang up the mitt.Including stopping to take pictures, the whole project took about an hour.  One could make a set with a pot holder, too, using the same technique, except with only one inside towel layer sandwiched between the blue jean layers.  I love to give gifts, and I really love to make things, too.  It's nice when I get to be creative and give someone something that is useful and homemade - but also didn't take six months of planning and preparation to get done.  Nothing on this list would take more than a day - from start to finish - except, maybe, the book safe.  What are some of your favorite last minute gifts to make?"},
{"title": "If Poverty is a Disease, Prepping is the Antidote", "date": "Tuesday, December 8, 2020", "text": "I was a very poor college student - married with kids and never, quite, making those ends meet, no matter how hard I pulled at the strings. I don't really know where I fell in the economic spectrum, but income-wise I was probably well below the mark that divides people who are (supposedly) financially independent and those who aren't making enough money to subsist at any level. It was, literally, a matter of shuffling the bills and paying the one that was most urgent (like paying the past due rent so that we wouldn't get evicted and letting some other bill lag). As a full-time college student with children and a job, I didn't have to time to sit at the social security office waiting for a case worker who would scowl at me, ask me a lot of very personal questions, and then, decide if I was worthy (or unworthy) enough for assistance, and frankly, I didn't want to. It was bad enough applying for food stamps, which I did, once, as a graduate student, when a promised summer job fell through and I was unemployed for a few months.Being poor is demoralizing, because, as a culture, we tend to take a pretty negative view of those who can't seem to take care of themselves or their families. We always assume that they're poor through some lack of moral fortitude that enables the rest of us to hold down a well-paying job. Over the past decade (starting with the 2008 housing market crash with a huge exacerbation created by the 2020 Pandemic), the face of the poor has been changing. Our middle-class perceptions of who and what poor people are were never entirely fair, but what's happening now, as discussed in this article, entitled The Growing Problem of Suburban Poverty is that previously middle class people, those who formerly had steady jobs and incomes, some savings, and a 401K plan, are the new poor.Sadly, however, unlike those who were living just above the poverty line, the average middle-class suburbanite is woefully ill-equipped to handle poverty-level incomes. Perhaps the worse is their own perceptions of poverty that don't allow them to seek the help they need early enough for that help to be useful, but rather begin to draw on their personal resources (which prove to be woefully inadequate), including a positive credit rating that allows them to try to borrow their way out of poverty. Of course, when we're thinking logically the notion that incurring more debt will somehow, magically, help us get out of debt, is ridiculous, but when faced with mounting financial issues and no income ... we do what we feel we have to do.For many years my daughters and I would visit our local library on a weekly basis.  The library is an amazing place with so many incredible resources.  Everyone knows they have books, but there are also music CDs, movies, and magazines, subscriptions to online learning services, access to a computer or just access to the Internet for those with their own computers, and lots of other incredible - FREE - offerings.  Back in the day, my youngest enjoyed borrowing movies.  One of her favorite finds was the film adaptation of Beverly Cleary's book series Ramona and Beezus about a third grader, her older, high-school aged sister, and their family. In the movie, Ramona's family is a typical suburban family living well, but slightly above their means (I am assuming that they live above their means given that there is a mention of how many bills they have and how overwhelming those bills are). The dad, a Vice President of something well-paying and important, loses his job when his company is bought-out by a competitor. Ramona's mother takes a part-time job at a doctor's office to help stem the tide of bills, but her income isn't nearly adequate to cover the standard of living they have come to expect. Couple that with the fact that they've just applied for and been approved a home improvement loan, believing that the dad's job was secure.It's a kid's story, and so while the whole economic crisis part of the story is downplayed for the audience, the fact is that things aren't good in the Quimby household. We get glimpses of the seriousness of their troubles: a chat with Ramona's friend whose parents are divorced, reportedly because of similar financial problems; the dad sleeping on the pull-out couch; rumors that they might lose their house (and Ramona's ill-fated attempts to earn enough money to keep that from happening); the car breaking down; dad's continued failure to find a job. The problem with the average suburbanite, and what gets them into so much trouble in situations like this is the idea that things will get better, and that this little problem is a very short-term and temporary problem. Like in the movie. Ramona and her family don't make any real changes to their lifestyle. The dad keeps going on job interviews and keeps not getting the job, and the whole time, their bills keep mounting, and they keep digging further into that hole. So, what could they have done differently?Well, for starters, the Mom should never have taken a job. She was the primary care provider for the kids, and while the dad did an adequate job taking over for mom (in his spare time, i.e. when he wasn't actively seeking employment), their family dynamic was to have one, full-time care provider at home. With the loss of his job and the subsequent employment of his wife, the dad became responsible for more of the household responsibilities, which caused a lot of problems. But here's the thing - if that family intended for the dad to be the primary wage earner (which they did), he needed to have the freedom and flexibility to find a job without having to worry about the safety and security of his children. Because his wife was working, he didn't have that freedom or flexibility, and it cost him a few interviews. Second, they should have canceled the home improvement loan, or at least changed how they were using it. Instead of employing the contractors to do the work, maybe the dad could have enlisted the help of a few friends to do the renovation, and paid for just supplies, rather than supplies and labor. DIY is a lot cheaper than having someone do the work, and that applies across the board - not just in construction.Third, the dad made the classic blunder of trying to find a comparable job. He should have listened to his eight year old daughter, who had a wisdom no one seemed to notice. She kept suggesting jobs she thought he could do. Perhaps with some training (which can often be paid for through reemployment programs), he would have been eligible for some of her more radical suggestions (like fire fighter, a job the dad, rightly, said he was unqualified to do - but the fact is that EMT training can be completed in a matter of weeks). Or better, he could have taken the opportunity this job loss afforded him to seek employment in a field in which he really wanted to work - like art. To them, this job loss was not an opportunity, but a hurdle. Reframing the problem in a different way would have made their situation a lot different.Fourth, the family should have started, immediately, cutting back, and the movie didn't show whether or not they did this, but it is common, in similar situations, to try to keep up the ruse that nothing has changed. Too often when faced with a job loss or other economic SNAFUs, the people involved will just keep living as if it will all be better when they wake in the morning. The day the event takes place is the time to sit down and start making changes, cutting everything from the budget that is not, absolutely, essential. The fourth is the hardest, because so many of our day-to-day activities, we see as being very much a part of who we are, and it's hard to give those things up, but it would be imperative.I think about this possibility all of the time, and it's not that I don't trust Deus Ex Machina's ability to financially support our family, but that I know anything can happen - and it usually does. Given that situation, the only bills we would continue to pay would be ones related to our housing - like a mortgage and property taxes. As I've said dozens of times, as long as we have our house, our basic needs for shelter, food, and water would be met.If the Quimby family had tightened the belt, immediately, anticipating that there might not be a job for a while, then, they would have been, potentially, better off (although, as a kid's movie, things never really got very bad, and of course, there was the requisite happy ending). Preppers have become the butt of a lot of jokes. Between the Doomsday Prepper television show and myriad of bloggers and authors speaking on the subject, there is, perhaps, some fuel for the comedy train. If nothing else, preppers are certainly passionate about what they're doing, and the need for it. The problem is that because some preppers (and survivalists) are seen as radical and fringe, and perhaps a bit ... fanatical, the average person, like Ramona's family in the story, aren't listening. They're not listening, because they don't want other people to look at them and laugh. No one wants to be the butt of a joke. So, most people don't prep, at all, and when they are visited by hard times, they also don't share what's happening - for fear of ridicule.For many preppers, though, it's not about preparing for Lucifer's Hammer or nuclear war or an EMP strike or the oil running out. It's about preparing for those things that happen every day to ordinary people, like the suburbanites in the article linked above. There is nothing radical or fringe or fanatical about having food available and in one's home. I can't imagine having only enough food to get me through a day or two. With as busy as my life is most of the time, I can't imagine not being able to whip up something from my cabinets or storage for dinner without having to visit the grocery store first. Other prepper suggestions are similar. There is nothing radical or fringe or fanatical about having a Berkey container of filtered water (and it tastes better, too) on the counter, a few extra blankets (don't you ever have company?), and flashlights with batteries that work. It's true that a three-day supply of food or a 2 1/2 gallon pitcher of filtered water on the counter won't help if one is unemployed for six months or more, but it's also true that beginning to think in terms of it could happen to me gets us thinking about how to make things less of an emergency when it does happen. It's a difference in mind-set more than a difference in what one has in one's garage.In 2008, the world went into an economic recession, from which *I believe* we never truly recovered.  From jobs reports, from prices at the grocery store and the gas pump, from listening to my friends and family, even if the Recession did end, we never really got back to \"normal.\"  Then, the Pandemic destroyed any pretense of normal we might have been courting.  Everyone, now, is talking about the new normal, and they don't just mean wearing masks. In much of Suburbia, the new normal is called poverty, and it's not a lack of moral fortitude, and it's not a shameful horror that we should hide - because the reality is that friends and neighbors usually know there's trouble a long time before that foreclosure sign ends up on the front lawn.The antidote to poverty is not more money or better jobs, but rather independence. There's that saying, \"Make hay while the sun shines,\" and the gist is that if we squander the happy days, when the bad days come, it's too late. In real terms, a farmer who does not hay his field while the sun is shining will lose the hay, which could be a devastating blow and result in a loss of livestock. In the same way as the farmer, if we don't prepare for the possibilities, we stand to lose it all. The sad fact is that we don't have to. In the 1930s, those folks who were, even marginally, self-sufficient suffered a great deal less than those who had been living high in the Roaring 20s.  The same was and is true of those who have been prepping this year.  I never ran out of toilet paper or soap.  When the store shelves emptied of pasta and tomato sauce, I went home and made spaghetti for dinner, because I had what I needed in my cabinets.  We spent the summer growing a garden, raising our chickens, and stacking the wood we use to warm our house over the winter.  In short, we did what we normally do.  The only thing that changed for us during this emergency was that we have to wear a mask.Falling onto hard times happens to all of us at some point.   Being poor doesn't make us bad, and accepting that hard times are a fact of life and preparing for when (not if) they happen could be difference between keeping that suburban home or ending up at the park living in a tent."},

{"title": "Renewal", "date": "Tuesday, December 1, 2020", "text": "According to my Google Blogger profile, I have been on Blogger since 2005.  That's a long time.  My original blog was happilyhome.blogspot.com.  I spent over a decade on that blog, and a long the way I met some pretty amazing people, and we shared some pretty amazing stories.  I guess, that's what social media should be about, isn't it?  Instead of the rapid-fire, opinion-laced, dehumanizing experience we all end up having on FB, we used to have this, Blogger, where we shared our stories and our lives and supported each other.  It was a different world.A year or so ago, I deleted my old blog, but Blogger refused to erase my footprint.  I guess I'm thankful for that, because my old blog list is still there.  I took the opportunity, today, to go down the list and see who's still around.  Most of the folks I knew back in those days are no longer blogging and haven't been for five or more years.  Sad.  But I get it.  We were part of a movement of people who desired a self-sufficient lifestyle, outside of the norm, on those proverbial fringes, and we didn't find much community or support for what we were doing locally, but many of us found camaraderie here.  Then, Facebook happened, and a lot of people left blogger to go to FB.  It took me five years to jump on the bandwagon.  I have, indeed, lived to regret that move.  What's interesting is that FB has become less than what we wanted, and none of what we thought we needed, and many folks are coming back here.If you're back on blogger, and we knew each other back in the day, please leave me a comment and let me know what you're up to these days.I would also love for you to share some of your favorite new blogs.  I'm rebuilding my reading list, and I'm looking to make some new connections. The Pandemic has me trying all sorts of things I never thought I would try.I'm doing some online shopping, although I have been steering clear of the big A conglomerate website portal-of-all-things-want-inspired, and I go directly to the manufacturer.  I found some great syrups to go with our Soda Stream from a company in Michigan.  While they aren't \"local\", they are definitely a better choice (in my opinion) than supporting the Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola Corporations, and I can order my syrups with cane sugar rather than HFCS.  So, there's a bonus.  We don't drink a lot of sugary soft drinks, but using the syrups and our own carbonated water has saved us a lot of cash over purchasing from one of the cola companies.  Plus, we can reduce the amount of syrup, which means we use less syrup (which saves money), and we use less syrup (which means we consume less sugar).  Win/win!I also just bought soap from Dr. Bonner's.  Ordinarily, I would just buy it at the grocery store, but my local grocery store hasn't had the almond scented bars in a very long time.  The cost was pretty much what I would have paid at the grocery store.  There was no savings ... except that we will have all of that soap in the scent that we want.  Dr. Bonner's bar soap is an all-in-one, which means that Deus Ex Machina and I use it both on our bodies and for our hair.  So, while I spend $4.79 for one bar of soap, I am only buying ONE BAR OF SOAP, and not soap AND shampoo.  So ... savings, right?I know my above online shopping adventures don't sound like I'm saving any money, but here's the deal, as every prepper knows, that having a store of supplies on hand, IS cost savings, not necessarily, because we got some smoking hot deal when we bought it, but because every visit to the store costs more money than one intended.  No matter how disciplined one is and how well one plans and how careful one is to adhere to one's list, there will always be an impulse buy.  There is also the time spent driving to and fro, and the cost of the gasoline to get to the store.  If I don't go to the store, I don't spend that extra cash.  It's that simple.  All that aside, the current reality, for me, is that I simply don't want to go to the grocery store any more often than I absolutely have to, and while I do love a bargain, what's more important to me, right now, is not having to mask-up and endure the palpable tension and angst that has become too much a part of today's shopping experience.  The anxiety and fear hang in the air like a fog ... and I swear I can see it.  Or, it may just be my glasses fogging up, because of the mask.  Either way, I don't enjoy going to store.A trusted friend recommended Misfits Market, which is a service that delivers \"rescued\" organic produce for a per-box fee.  Basically, they find produce items that are not going to be sold in the store for whatever reason.  Sometimes it's too small or too big, or just misshapen, i.e. \"ugly.\"  Sometimes it's at that age when the store wouldn't be able to sell it.  It's still edible, but not as \"fresh\" as Hannaford is going to require, given that it might spend a week on Hannaford's shelf.  I have the option of how often I receive a box, how much produce (by weight) is in my box, and what day of the week my produce is delivered.  I am now also able to customize my box and choose produce that I know my family is more likely to use. The big question, for Deus Ex Machina, was, does it save us money.  After my last delivery, I made a list of everything that I had received.  When I went to the grocery store, I compared prices.  We did not save money.   That is, the cost of my box was not less-than what I would have paid, if I had just purchased those items at the grocery store.   But we didn't spend more money either.  The prices were actually comparable.   Breaking even is not better than saving money, but when one considers all of it, I think we actually did make out ahead of the game.  The convenience of having it delivered to my door, the unintended savings from not shopping as frequently, the savings in gas and time from not going to the grocery store, all mean that there is some passive savings aspect to the experience.And, we're eating food that might have been thrown away - organic food.  So, that part feels

{"title": "Thanksgiving ... from the Pantry", "date": "Saturday, November 28, 2020", "text": "I didn't go shopping for Thanksgiving dinner.  On Veteran's Day, a full two weeks before Thanksgiving, my local grocery store had a special 10% off for Veterans.  So, I went shopping.  I would have gone shopping that week - not that day, but that week, and so it wasn't like I made a special trip, but that day was a little different, because I intended to get what we would need to get us through until after Thanksgiving.My thoughts were:  the days leading up to Thanksgiving would be a mad-house at the grocery store because of the holiday; the Governor's newest mandates would make people anxious and in survivalist mode, which would make the grocery store a mad-house; and fewer trips to the grocery store saves us money.With the goal of NOT returning to the grocery store for two weeks, I headed out, list in hand.  Thing is, I already had most of what we would want for a \"traditional\" Thanksgiving Turkey dinner, and the only thing I purchased, special, for the meal was a pecan pie with a gluten-free crust from a Maine-based company, and turkey - I bought two turkeys, which ended up being a very good idea. I keep butter and cream on hand at all times.  I have a store of things like evaporated milk.  I have pumpkin, both canned and fresh, for pies.  I always have potatoes, onions, and garlic in the pantry.  I had some cabbages and home-grown sprouts for salads/slaw with ingredients for all sorts of dressings (we had standard cole slaw).  I have canned corn, if we'd wanted that.  We roasted butternut squash and acorn squash.  I also made homemade cranberry sauce from the cranberries in the freezer.I even made \"stuffing\" - or my version of a savory bread crumb dish that's all as good as that \"Stove-Top\" stuff from the box.  I didn't run out of anything.  I didn't have to go to the store for last minute stuff, and I didn't have to substitute anything.  Six of us enjoyed a homecooked meal - most of it from scratch (including the whipped cream made with heavy cream and powdered sugar).And my youngest adult made beignets - from scratch.  There was nothing super fancy about any of the food.  But that's not what it's about, is it?  It's about being thankful that we aren't starving; thankful for a successful harvest; thankful that we have enough food to get us through good times and bad.  What I already knew, but was able to confirm from this Thanksgiving meal, was that we have enough, and for that I am incredibly and eternally thankful.**My oldest daughter had originally planned to be with us on Thanksgiving, but had to change her plans last minute.  Unfortunately, it was VERY last minute, which meant that she couldn't get to the store.  I was able to give her turkey, potatoes, and cranberries from my pantry without sacrificing anything we wanted to have on our dinner table.=====================================Easy Stuffing - from the Pantry1/2 stick of butter1/2 onion, chopped4 small cloves of garlic minced (optional)2 tsp of dried sage (or to taste)1 tsp celery salt (or to taste)6 to 8 slices of bread - cut into small cubes1/2 cup water or brothDirections:1.  Melt butter in a sauce pan.  Add onion and garlic.  Cook until aromatic.2.  Add herbs/seasonings.3.  Add bread crumbs and mix well to thoroughly coat the bread.4.  Add broth, just enough to soak bread, but not make it soupy. I serve it right away without any extra cooking.  I have also used this same, basic, recipe to stuff acorn squash."},
{"title": "Using What I Have", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2020", "text": "I hate wearing a mask.  I have trouble breathing, which makes me pant, and then, my glasses fog up.  It's a real problem.There's a lot of advice out there about things I could put on my glasses to keep them from fogging up, but what happens when I clean off my glasses - with my shirt tail, because that's how we do it, right? - and the anti-fogging stuff wipes off?  One of the problems was that my mask didn't fit tight to my face.  It's a simple, homemade cloth mask.  If I had put wire across the bridge part of the mask, I could cinch it down, or if I had a way to adjust the ear loops, maybe I wouldn't have that problem.There are little things we could buy - little loop tightener-thingies.  I've also been advised that I can get a frame for the inside of my mask that will keep the mask off my face.Here's the thing - and frankly I don't care if you agree with me or not - I REFUSE to support this industry that has sprung up around this virus.  I REFUSE to purchase masks (well, except the Halloween one with the big vampire smile, because ... well, it was funny!) or mask associated apparatus.  Way back, in April, when masks became required attire in public places, I put my mad skills to use and made a bunch of masks.  I used materials I had on hand - elastic from old bed sheets and panties; and fabric from my stash.  The recommendation was two layers of tight-weave cloth, like quilter's fabric.  Flannel was also recommended/preferred.  I had a lot of both.  Unfortunately, masks really aren't one-size-fits-all, and while Deus Ex Machina had no problem with the masks I made, I found mine were a bit loose.  But it didn't matter all that much, because I only need to wear it when I'm out shopping - which is rare - and I figured it wouldn't be long before the mask was a bad memory.Enter: The dreaded SECOND WAVE and the MASK MANDATES.So, here I am, with ill-fitting masks, foggy glasses, and a bad attitude.Instead of grinding my teeth to nubs, I decided to do the soldier thing:  suck-it-up and drive on.  In other words come up with a workable solution.I started thinking about what I had that could fix my problem.I could pull out my handy-dandy needle and thread and sew a loop in the ear pieces. Or I could fashion one of those loop adjuster thingies using materials that I have on hand.As a homeschooling mom with very crafty kids, I have accumulated a lot of stuff over the years.  We practiced \"strewing\" in our unschooling household.  \"Strewing\" is a technique wherein the educational facilitator (i.e. Mom and Dad) leaves items for the kids to find and explore.  Posters showing cursive handwriting, mathematical orders of operation, and the times table?  Check.Books about every topic in the world?  Check.Paint and painting supplies?  Check.Beads for jewelry making?  YES!I thought about what I had, on hand, that could work - the beads!  Then, I had to think a bit more about how to get the elastic through the bead.  The bent paperclip was a perfect tool. And it works!  The mask fits snugly to my face, without putting pressure on my nose, and keeps my glasses from fogging up.I am pretty thankful that I never mustered the energy to do a full-on Marie Kondo of my home.  Too many of the things I might have donated or tossed, have come in handy - especially these last few months. That's not a recommendation to keep the clutter, but for me, there are definitely some things that I will think twice about simply jettisoning. And I love that I can usually find what I need, right here, where I am."},
{"title": "Not Feeling \"Powerless\" on Thanksgiving", "date": "Friday, November 20, 2020", "text": "Thanksgiving is next week.  Thirteen years ago on Thanksgiving, we had an all local meal.  We were interviewed by the newspaper, because in those days, the Locavore movement was still pretty new, and eating a whole Thanksgiving meal using ONLY food sourced from Maine was a novelty.  I was looking through my blog archives for that post, but I didn't find it, or the one where we made Acorn Pie (using a modified pecan pie recipe) and our Thanksgiving dinner was a lot of homegrown and locally foraged foods.  I didn't find that one either. What I did find was a post from 2014.  That year, we also had a local Thanksgiving dinner, but with a really interesting twist.But I'll let you read it.  And then, let me know what you would have done .... :)================================Originally posted on Survive the Suburbs November 30, 2014.IT SNOWEDOn Thanksgiving Eve much of the northeast was pummeled with a huge snowstorm. I say that with a bit of tongue-in-cheek, because only a few days before this, parts of Upstate New York really were pummeled with snow in a storm that put more snow on the ground than most people are tall. They had an emergency. With less than 12\" in most places, we had a bit of inconvenience.What made this snowstorm newsworthy was the fact that it was a very heavy, wet snow - which is actually kind of typical for this time in the season. The first few snowstorms and the last few snowstorms are always that heavy, wet stuff that no one likes to shovel, and it's the best snow for making snowmen and snowballs, because it's the kind of snow that really sticks together.I heard, once, that the Inuit people had multiple words for snow, which makes sense, because snow has different characteristics depending on the time of year, the temperature, and the humidity in the air. But I digress.On Wednesday night, our electricity blipped off. No one panicked, because, well, there's nothing to panic about. It's just electricity. It's not like the roof caved in.We lit some candles, stoked up the woodstove, and pulled out the Scrabble board. No electricity? Family game night! Woot! After an exciting hour of word-smithing, I decided to see if I could get the mobile hotspot on my phone to work and was able to successfully connect my laptop to the Internet. I didn't stay on for very long, because I wanted to save my batteries. Big Little Sister and Little Fire Faery treated us to some music. What's that commercial? Instruments = $$. Music lessons = X dollars per month. Private concert = priceless. Beautiful voices raised in song accompanied by an acoustic guitar with the fire in the woodstove crackling in the background was perfect. It's exactly what every summer camping trip is all about - getting off the grid and just enjoying the moment.Thanksgiving morning we woke up, and there was still no electricity. We made coffee and fed the dogs and cats. The girls went out and took care of the animals outside. I turned on my laptop and connected up to the Internet for a couple of minutes. Then, I cut a squash in half, took out the seeds, put one half in the Dutch oven with a bit of water, and put it on the woodstove to cook. I took the cranberries out of the freezer, put them in a pan with a bit of water and some sugar and put it on the woodstove to cook. Deus Ex Machina plugged our on-demand propane water heater into the jumpstarter (ours is similar to this one, but not this exact one), and we took hot showers. Big Little Sister had volunteered to walk dogs at the animal shelter on the holiday, and so Little Fire Faery, Big Little Sister, and I hopped in the car and drove up to the animal shelter. We charged our phones on the drive up and back. While Big Little Sister walked dogs, Little Fire Faery and I sat in the multi-cat room and petted the cats. While we were gone, Deus Ex Machina prepared the bacon-wrapped rabbit, which we planned to have for dinner. Also on the menu was the wild turkey Deus Ex Machina took with his bow back in October. We decided to spatchcock it and cook it on the grill. He got that ready while the girls and I were at the animal shelter. The grandbabies showed up around dinner time. We lit the oil-lamp wall sconces in the living room and a table top oil-lamp in the dining room. Plus, we had some candles, which I've been collecting and purchasing whenever I find them at Goodwill. Another item that I've been collecting, partly for situations just like this one, but also for when we have our family parties, are \"glow sticks\". I can usually find them on clearance right after Halloween, and I buy as many as I can find. They're a lot of fun for the kids when they're playing nighttime hide-and-seek (also called \"Manhunt\") during the summer.  When we have power outage, I like to have them for use in the bathrooms rather than leaving an untended candle, and they put off a surprisingly bright light. We had our Thanksgiving dinner and cleaned up the dishes using water we heated on the woodstove. The girls ate all of the ice cream in the freezer, because it was starting to get soft. The girls played some games and drew some pictures. I did some reading by oil lamp. We all went to bed early. The grandbabies stayed the night and really enjoyed their glow-stick bracelet night lights.Friday morning we woke up without electricity. We made coffee and fed the dogs and cats. The girls took care of the animals outside. I put the cast iron skillet on the woodstove and made some breakfast sandwiches. We went to music lessons. We stopped by the library. We came home. The girls folded clothes. I swept the floors and cleaned up the kitchen. The electricity came back on around 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday. We had been electricity-free for about thirty-nine hours. And nothing, really, about our daily lives changed. There was no emergency, and we didn't sit, fearfully huddling in a cold house and waiting for someone to save us. We joked with the librarians that, of course, this power outage wasn't an issue ... and since I wrote the book, if it were an issue, they would have to induct me into the Preppers Hall of Shame. The reality is, though, that even if I hadn't written the book (which is, really, just about how we live our lives anyway) that this power outage wouldn't have been any different for us than it was. The power grid is fragile, and most of us have experienced a power outage at some point in our lives. Most of the time it's a blip and then the lights come right back on, but on more than one occasion, in the seventeen years I've lived here in Maine, the power has been off for more than twenty-four hours. For this reason, we have created a lifestyle that allows us to easily transition when the power goes out.But it's not about having a 72 hour Bug Out Bag or emergency supplies. These things we have are things we use, and not *just* when the power goes out (except for the oil lamps, and pretty much, we only use those when there's no power). We heat with wood and during the winter, we often cook on the woodstove to save electricity. We use the jump starter battery to inflate our car and bicycle tires. We always use a French press for making coffee. We have consciously moved away from complete dependence on the electric grid, because we have seen how fragile it is, and we wanted our home to be that safe place we could go to - no matter what.It snowed on Wednesday, a typical, heavy, wet late fall snow that bowed the power lines and caused them to snap. We lived, our normal, every day lives, without electricity for thirty-nine hours. And on the other side, with the exception of no longer rationing computer time, not much has changed. **I linked to several products in this post - not as an advertisement, but to show those who might be curious what the things I mention look like.

{"title": "5 Best TEOTWAWKI Novels for Preppers", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2020", "text": "I am a bibliophile.  I often share the quote attributed to Erasmus, \"When I get money, I buy books.  If any is left over, I buy food and clothes.\"  It's not entirely true.  As my shelves have filled and overflowed, I've curbed my book buying - a little - but I still love a good book, and my favorite genre is post-apocalyptic and/or dystopian fiction.As you can imagine, since it's my favorite genre, I have read quite a few books on the subject, and so I have a pretty good pool from which to choose the best - or at least the best of the ones that I have read.I don't really like the ones that are pure \"prepper\" fiction - you know, where there's some guy who always knew something was going to happen, and had a bunker - or whatever - and fights off the hordes of ne'er-do-wells ... with aplomb!  We LOVE that guy, right?  In fact, we preppers are all imagining that we ARE that guy.I actually don't love that guy, because that guy is the one who shoots first and asks questions later.  I'm not a shoot first kind of gal.  I really need a reason to break out the firearms.  Probably, one doesn't want to give me a reason.  Just sayin'.Too often those pure prepper novels follow a predictable course.  There's an \"event.\"  The protagonist survives the event.  The protagonist goes on to become the \"leader\" of the other survivors, because he/she has some previous survival experience (usually from the military), and he/she will pick and choose who is worthy of his/her band of the survivors.  There's an antagonist who attacks the group, but he/she is thwarted, and the \"good guys\" prevail.I guess I bristle at the good guys vs. bad guys, because too often we are all a bit of both, and what's good or moral, especially in a survival scenario, can be incredibly subjective.  Defend your family?  Yes!  Of course!  Kill someone else to do it?  Is that good or moral when everyone is just trying to survive?  Anyway, the following list is my favorites for post-apocalyptic fiction, because these books gave some really good advice on specific things we could do to ensure our survival in a TEOTWAWKI scenario.1.  Oyrx & Crake, by Margaret AtwoodThis book is probably the most disturbing of the the ones in the list.  There are a few scenes in the book that are definitely NOT recommended for young readers.  This book also isn't one of those that starts in our \"normal\" world - or at least in the actual, current, reality in which we find ourselves.  We meet Jimmy, the Snowman.  He is a human, who lives among a group of genetically enhanced humanoids that were created in a laboratory.  Their creator - Crake - is a mad scientist who was attempting to create the perfect human and combined genetic features from various other living organisms (like the ability to heal using a cat purr and the ability to digest rough fibers by ... well, in a rabbit-like way).  We quickly discover that the world has ended, and the only \"people\" left are Jimmy, and this tribe of genetic anomalies.  The human race has been destroyed, and all that's left of human-kind are Crake's people.  Without giving it away, the story is a cautionary tale about believing too much in \"science.\"  It is a caution about trusting big corporations, especially when money is involved.  As prepper fiction, it warns us to be wary about \"drinking the proverbial Koolaid.\"  While I'm pretty certain that I was standing on the cliff already, this was probably the novel that pushed me over the conspiracy-theory edge and into those dark waters of distrust and extreme caution.  I don't eat genetically modified food, if I can avoid it; I don't take OTC medication; and I don't trust our corporate-owned government.  2.  Lucifer's Hammer, Larry Niven and Jerry PournelleLucifer's Hammer is an asteroid that is hurtling toward Earth.  Some in the scientific community believe that it will miss us.  Others warn that it's the end.  Since there is not a general consensus in the scientific community, when the asteroid actually DOES hit, too many folks are unprepared.What I loved about the novel was some of the very creative last minute preps that the authors described.  For example, one of the protagonists, finally deciding, hours before impact, that he believed his astronomer friend, went shopping at the last minute, and like the johnny-come-lately shoppers in March 2020, he found a lot of bare space on the shelves where all of those non-perishables had been.  Unlike those folks, who left empty handed and angry, he shifted gears and thought, \"What CAN I get?\"He bought a couple of huge beef roasts, a lot of pepper and salt, and a butt-load of alcohol.  No, not the kind to make hand-sanitizer.  The kind to drink - rum, vodka, whiskey ....  Then, he took it all home, sliced the meat thin, seasoned it with salt and pepper, and dehydrated it all.  Beef jerky, man!  It was genius!  As prepper fiction, it encourages us to be more creative when it comes to our preps, and to remind us that there's still time to do SOMETHING.  Just start.3.  One Second After, William ForschenThis is probably my least favorite of the books* on this list, because it's a little too much the formula prepper novel, but since I included, you can be sure that there was something I found intriguing and useful in the story.  The story is set in the US southeast.  A retired military officer lives in a semi-rural Appalachian community with his children.  At the beginning of the story, the US is attacked by an EMP.  This story is very similar to Pat Frank's Alas, Babylon.   Frank's story is much better written, and Frank's characters deal with some issues that many preppers may not think about - like the lack of salt and the importance of the mineral for food preservation - but I included the Forschen novel instead, because in the latter novel, the protagonist's daughter is a diabetic.  I don't think that Forschen handles that medical issue very well, but because he does make it a story-line, it prompted ME to look for solutions for insulin-dependent diabetics so that at the end of the world as we know, they wouldn't be facing an automatic death sentence.Thankfully (even though it really is all theory, and he admits it), Dr. Bones from the website, Doom and Bloom: Survival Medicine, did an entire series on how to deal with and treat diabetes in a powered down world.  We hope we never have to test his theories, but if the SHTF, at least here's something to try.From a survival standpoint, this book made me look a bit more into survival medicine, and treatments for ailments, I might not have looked into.*I was really annoyed in the beginning of the book when the grocer started barbequing all of the meat in his cooler after they lost electricity, and it has always bothered me that they didn't try to preserve the meat for the future use rather than having a big gorge-fest at the beginning of the emergency.   4. Eternity Road, Jack McDevittI'm not sure that most preppers would even consider this prepper fiction.  It is post-apocalypse, though, and it is actually really well written.  McDevitt spins a fascinating tale.The story takes place a few centuries AFTER the human race has been destroyed by plague.   Nature has all-but wiped out most traces of human existence, and those few survivors live in small colonies.  They are illiterate - that is, very few, written documents survived, and then ones that did are incredibly precious.  Like the Monks of the Dark Ages, scribes have been employed to recreate those stories of old.There's a rumor that a whole library of books was stashed in some bunker on what used to be the East Coast, near the ocean, and this story is the trek back to the Atlantic in search of these old books.McDevitt's tale is fascinating and beautifully written.  It's a shame this his book isn't more popular, just for the fact of how beautifully woven the story is.  As a prepper novel, it made me take a really hard look at books, and how important they are, and more importantly, how important they will be for helping to preserve our history, but also, the knowledge we have.  We have forgotten how lovely sitting down with a good book is, because sitting and watching television or playing on our phones is just so much easier.  Eternity Road is a good reminder that if the SHTF, we won't be able to depend on our electronics.  Those old books will be all we have.  5.  World Made By Hand, James Howard KunstlerThe first book I ever read by JHK wasn't fiction.  It was The Long Emergency - the book he wrote that predicted - or rather WARNED - about just the kinds of things we are currently experiencing.  In the Prepper world, we like to think that the \"end\" will come in a big bang, and then, those of us who are smart and prepared will survive to create a new world.  Kunstler does not ascribe to that notion, and in fact, The Long Emergency cautions us to not become frogs in boiling water - complacent to our inevitable demise because we ignore the rising temperature.While JHK's non-fiction talks about the long-con, his fictional TEOTWAWKI is a little faster.  The story opens 10 years after an \"event.\"  Well, not just one event, but a series of unfortunate events (with a nod to Lemony Snicket for the wording), that include the bombing of DC and a flu pandemic.  Can I say that word?  It takes place in a small town in upper New York State.  There are a lot of things to really like about the series.  At a minimum, JHK is a good story-teller, but what I really liked about the story was the community aspect.  Too much of prepper fiction focuses on keeping out the bad guys.  In this story, while there are some pretty bad guys, the reality is ... well, reality.  People are people, and there often isn't a truly clear distinction between really \"good\" and really \"bad.\"  There is room for a lot of gray in the world.What makes the big difference in TEOTWAWKI will be our ability to come together as a community and work to support and protect each other - not just those we deem worthy.  I loved that not everyone was perfect.  Obviously, there are a lot of other really amazing post-apocalyptic stories out there.  What's your favorite?"},
{"title": "Good Neighbors", "date": "Monday, November 9, 2020", "text": "I've been working on this project with the group Real Voices Media.  The goal was to flood social media and the Internet with \"good vibes\", especially during the election process.   Basically, I am given a list of topics to choose from each week, and I make a 1 to 3 minute video on the topic.This week the topic was about neighbors.  In the past I've written a lot about my neighbors.  And, honestly, I do have AMAZING neighbors!  Maybe I'm just lucky.  Maybe it's a two-way street.Either way, I am very fortunate that I live among some amazing people.When Deus Ex Machina and I bought our house two decades ago, the first neighbors we met were the ones across the fence.  We bought our house in December, and in the spring, when things had thawed a bit, we were out in the yard.  They made a point of introducing themselves.  I still have their business card for the \"Born Again Christian Sanctuary.\"We didn't agree philosophically about everything, but they were amazing neighbors, and we were incredibly fortunate to know them.  The Missus didn't drive, and when the Mister started showing signs of age-related brain fog, I was just on the other side of the fence if they needed a ride.  One winter, it snowed ... a LOT ... I mean, it IS Maine.  They were worried about the vents on their heating system getting covered with snow.  Deus Ex Machina went over and shoveled for them.  When they knew they weren't going to can anymore, I inherited all of their canning supplies.  What a bounty!  And they told amazing stories, too.  They knew the original owner of my house.  He was a close friend, and in fact, they had sold him the land to build this house.  I am eternally grateful to them for their generosity to and friendship with Barney.The first spring we lived here, we had a two-week stretch of gorgeous, warm weather in mid-April.  So, I took my tomato starts outside and put them in the ground.  The Mister saw me starting that first garden, and he inquired as to what I was doing.  When I told him, he cautioned me that, normally, we didn't plant those tender plants until after Memorial Day, at the end of May.  I scoffed.  It was so warm!  It was time!That night, there was a killing frost, and I lost all of those plants.  He never said, \"I told you so.\"  I don't think he even ever mentioned those plants or that first little attempt at gardening in Maine.  They both passed away a couple of years ago.  I miss them.  They were (are) wonderful people and very good neighbors.  When our neighbors across the street moved into their house in the middle of a February snowstorm, I headed into my kitchen and baked some muffins, which I took over to them and introduced myself - asking if we could help them out with anything.  They are great folks and have been a huge part of our journey.  Sometimes in the summer, when I would be out in the yard working in my garden, the Mister would be playing his guitar.  He had been a professional musician in the 1960s, and the music was that early folk rock sound.  I'd be tying up tomato plants or making a cage for my potato towers and listening to those electric tunes, and I could imagine myself on a commune in those back-to-the-land days, working the garden with a live music accompaniment.  It was meditative - my hands in the dirt planting something that would feed us or doing the physical work of tending my \"land\", while his music transported me to someplace higher - such as good music is wont to do.  On those warm days, when I knew he'd be practicing with his windows open, I would find something to do out in the yard.  I have lots of stories about my awesome neighbors.  We may not share holidays together.  I don't know when their birthdays are.  We don't even get together regularly for summer barbeques, but when we need something, we're there for each other.  A huge part of preparedness, for me, is that cultivating of kinships with my neighbors.  There is safety in numbers.  Moreover, those who have lived in a place for a long time, know things about that place, that maybe we don't know, and further, those who have lived long, know much.  They may not always be able to share their knowledge in some linear or succinct way, but if we listen to their stories, they will tell us what we need to know.I have been blessed to live in a place with very good neighbors, and I do know that I am fortunate.  And yes, every day, I am thankful."},
{"title": "Food Thrift", "date": "Sunday, November 8, 2020", "text": "Friday, November 6 was \"National Nachos Day.\"  Usually I don't even pay attention to that sort of thing, but when I heard it on the radio on my way into work, my tummy grumbled, and I decided, we were having Nachos for dinner.  Don't judge.  They were delicious.In addition to the Nachos, I made Spanish rice and refried beans.I went a little overboard and forgot that I was only feeding four people.  So, there were leftovers.For lunch on Saturday, I threw the leftover rice, refried beans, and the seasoned ground beef into a sauce pan, added a bit of water, and heated it up.Deus Ex Machina was skeptical, but when he'd finished his first serving, he said, \"Okay.  It was good.\"The phrase, \"Waste not.  Want not.\"  means, if you don't waste stuff, you won't need stuff (be in want of).   I like that phrase, because it speaks to abundance rather than depletion.  It's a mindset.  Like \"poverty\" is a mindset.  A friend told me that when he was in high school studying Maine History, the teacher said they'd be skipping the whole Great Depression.  When asked why, the teacher said, \"Maine had already been in an economic depression for YEARS before the 1930s.  The thirties weren't worse for most Mainers than what they had already been living.\"What I hear a lot from people who lived in rural states and communities, was how they didn't realize they were \"poor\" until someone told them, because they had everything they needed, and what they didn't have they couldn't make.Most of us already have an abundance of whatever.  We just have to remember to be thoughtful in how we use it, and those things that we already have will keep us rich."},
{"title": "Thrifting", "date": "Saturday, November 7, 2020", "text": "I didn't grow up being thrifty or frugal.  Even when we hit some pretty tough times, financially, I don't recall that we were \"thrifty\", necessarily.  What we did was to just not spend any money.  There was a moratorium on ALL spending that wasn't absolutely necessary. So, we didn't get new clothes or shoes that year.  We probably ate a lot of cheap canned food.  When my parents' friend went fishing and caught a lot of fish, we thankfully accepted his gift of fresh fish.  It was delicious.  But we never went to the Goodwill or the Salvation Army store, or really, very many other Thrift stores ... well, except the used book store, and that was different.I grew up believing, like the \"rich girl\", mentioned in this video, that Thrift shopping was something poor people did, and that was sad.  It was sad that they were destitute, desperate ... needy.  It wasn't a character judgment.  It just was what it was.  Even when my family actually was destitute, desperate, and needy, when going to the Thrift store could have meant that I was well dressed in quality used clothing we'd purchased at a fraction of its SRP for a new garment, instead of wearing out-dated, hand-me-downs from the family in the cul-de-sac just up from my suburban home (and being embarrassed every day, because my polyester pants were \"Mom\" clothes from the 1960s), we didn't thrift store shop.In college, as a young mom and poor college student, I still didn't thrift shop.  It was that same mental block.  It was \"charity,\" and I didn't do charity ... accept I did for other things.  Just not clothes.As the saying goes, I wish I had known then, what I know now.  I was in my thirties the first time I met someone who had a discount card for Goodwill.  At first, I thought, \"Why would someone want a 10% discount on used stuff?\"I've come around to her kind of thinking.In fact, now, most of my clothes are from the consignment shop.  Like the mom in the above video, I have advised my children that the only new clothes they should buy are shoes and underwear.  Shoes, not because they are inherently unsanitary (I mean ... bowling), but because our natural gait will wear the soles of shoes in ways that may point to an unhealthy gait.But also, because the kinds of shoes that we're going to wear, and wear a lot, I want to last for a very long time.  I'm not a fan of yard sales, but I am LOVING the yard sale groups on social media.  I just bought a cabinet for my living room for a quarter of what it would have cost new. The video linked above is a spoken poem by Kelly Zimmerman, \"Ode To Thrift Stores\", and what she says resonated so much with who I am now, and how I feel about consumerism and stuff acquisition.What's funny is that what she says in much of the poem is exactly the Prepper mantra.  \"Make the Thing You Have, the Thing You Need.\"  As a prepper, that's exactly what I do, and after many years of spending too much time and too much money trying to buy what I thought I needed, I will take a few extra days to figure out if I already have what I need, or if I have something that could be modified to be what I need.  It's a good life.  And moreover, the knowledge that I am able to create something that can fit my needs is incredibly empowering.One of the best things about shopping at a thrift shop is, just as Kelly Zimmerman's mom advised, it changes.  What they have today will be completely different by tomorrow or the next day.  It's a revolving inventory, and so there's always something new, or interesting to see.If there's some reason why you don't thrift shop, if you think it's for poor people or that it's sad, please visit a thrift store.  You will be incredibly surprised, and maybe you won't find it the treasure trove so many of the rest of us have discovered, but I'll bet you enjoy looking through the books, CDs, or vinyl records!  Wait.  What?  Where do you think people send the stuff they don't need or want anymore?  Unless it's a consignment shop dedicated specifically to garments, clothes are just a portion of what can be found at the Thrift store.  Everything you can imagine can be found at the Thrift store - just not always in the color or size that you want, which is why you have to go back.  Go often."},
{"title": "Five Overlooked Pantry Staples You Should Buy Now", "date": "Tuesday, October 27, 2020", "text": "When the SHTF in March, grocery store shelves were stripped bare.  I walked into the store and got everything I went in to get in the brands that I usually buy.  I guess I don't shop like normal people, though.  We have some dietary restrictions and food choice preferences that change how we purchase food.  Specifically, we are gluten-free, which means when everyone else was looking for flour, I could not have cared less that that shelf was bare.Unfortunately, for the most part, the items that were most popular are still pretty popular, and my grocery store, at least, still has huge bare spots.  They haven't fully recovered and those shelves haven't been fully stocked in months.Predictions are that we are headed back into another similar, possibly worse, scenario.  The virus seems to be making another come-back.  Countries in Europe are already starting their second round of lockdowns, and with the increasing numbers in several states here in the US, we are, likely, not far behind them.  In addition, this is an election year.  Over the past 20 years, I have seen election years grow more and more divisive between the far right and left wings of our political spectrum, but the last few years have seen an even wider chasm between the ultra conservatives and uber liberals.  Compound that with the fact that the first lockdown caused a very real financial strain on individuals and the economy at large.  The restaurant industry is still trying to imagine ways to stay in business.  The farmers that supplied them food have had to become more creative and figure out ways to reconfigure their distribution to get direct-to-consumer sales.  In Maine, our economy is based on tourism, but we were still in lockdown for half the tourist season.  Most of the businesses that cater to tourists are struggling to stay afloat - if they haven't already buckled.  Federal and state grants and low-interest loans were helpful, but how much longer can we just count on tax dollars propping everything up?So between the very palpable political tensions which are being exacerbated by the pandemic (we're becoming the star-belly Sneetches - only with masks or flags or hats) and the economic collapse that we are in the midst of, thanks in a large part to our response to the pandemic, things are getting really ugly out there.At this point (and not to diminish the fight in Harlan Co.), but we're all singing Florence Reece's tune, Which Side Are You On?  The whole US has become those southeastern Kentucky coal fields, and it's only a matter of time before we truly pick up arms.  Harlan Co. was nicknamed Bloody Harlan.  It's not a place we should really be hoping to go, but it feels very much like that's where we're heading.In the Prepper world, we are on high alert. I mean, to be fair, Preppers are always a little more on edge than the average person, because we've accustomed ourselves to not being complacent.  Frankly, for me, it's been a good thing, because prepping = planning for the worst, and so when those \"worstcase scenarios\" (like a job loss or an extended power outage) kinds of things happen, we don't panic, because we're ready.Preppers are always in a state of readiness, but this feels a little more tense than even our normal tenseness.  Looking back on what happened in March and the very real possibility that next week things will be similar or worse, I've put together a list of things that most people won't consider adding to their preps, but that could make a world of difference.1.  Cornmeal/grits/popcorn.I am a history buff of sorts.  I am very interested in studying difficult times and how the folks living during those years handled things.  I really enjoy historical fiction and reenactments, because I like seeing how people lived before they had the modern amenities that we have today.  I get lots of ideas.In the 1800s Ireland was under British rule, but they weren't really protected by the British government.  So, basically, there were millions of Irish people living on their ancestral land, but with no right to use that land to feed their families or to earn a living.  I mean, sure they were tenant farmers-ish, but almost none of the food that was grown (and there was quite a lot of it, actually) was theirs.  What they could grow was potatoes, but as it happens, during that time period some crazy fungus drifted across the Atlantic and infected the entire potato crop, rendering it inedible.  The result is that millions of Irish people died a horrific death.In 2019 13.7 million US households (not people) were considered \"food insecure.\"  What that means is that those folks don't really know where their next meal is coming from.  That number has very likely increased - probably doubled - in 2020.  We could find ourselves in a \"Potato Famine\" kind of scenario where people are starving because they don't have access to food that they can eat or the money to purchase it.  Here's the thing, though.  During that potato famine, the Irish received aid from the US in the form of \"Indian corn.\"  Indian corn is a meal corn, not a sweet corn.  It's not boiled or grilled on the cob and slathered with butter.  It has to be processed to be digestible, and this usually entails soaking it in a lye solution.  Hundreds of thousands of native Americans survived for centuries on corn.  It is edible and nutritious, but because they lacked the understanding of how to make it so, the Irish suffered from eating the improperly processed grain.It's a pity.  Being a southern girl, I very much love corn - in all of its incarnations.  I even love grits.  My favorite breakfast is a bowl with one scrambled egg and grits, both swimming in butter.  I like grits with just salt and butter, but some people prefer it sweetened with a bit of sugar or syrup.  I like grits better than oatmeal, because grits are gooey, like, oatmeal.Earlier this year, when other cereal grains and flours were flying off the shelves at the grocery store, I still found cornmeal, grits, and popcorn.  Those three items can be a whole days worth of delicious meals and snacks.   Cornmeal is amazingly versatile.  It can be made into pancakes, bread, (my favorite) hush puppies, polenta, or just served boiled as a mash with salt and butter, or sweetened with some maple syrup.  I appreciated cornmeal before, but since going gluten-free, having such a versatile alternative to flour is wonderful.  2.  Roasted or raw nuts, seeds, and peanuts.My daughter adopted a big parrot named Spike two years ago.  I love the late fall at the grocery store, because that's when they start stocking the in-the-shell bags of mixed nuts.  I stock up on them when I find them, because they're good treats for the bird.For those who do not have allergies to tree nuts or peanuts, I can't stress enough how valuable these could be.  Properly stored and in the shell, they can last years.  And we all know what a great source of nutrition (especially protein and \"good\" fat) they are.  The pandemic saw runs on most fresh meats available at the store, but even worse, as the emergency wore on into the summer (growing season), and people who normally tend those animals got sick, we saw processing plants and factory farms closing down.  I'm not sad that factory farming took a huge hit, but at the same time, those people who depend on grocery store meat that is raised at those farms will find it more difficult to get cheap cuts, like hamburger and chicken legs.  Nuts could be an alternative.I do recommend stocking up on the nuts rather than the nut butters.  First, there's the whole long storage issue mentioned above.  In the shell, nuts last a lot longer than nut butters.  Second, nut butters can be more expensive than the whole nut and with a blender or food processor, one can make one's own butters.  Third, the whole nuts can be used in lots of ways other than just as a spread.  Here's a list of ten ways to enjoy nuts.  There's a little more versatility with whole nuts.  3.  Olive Oil.I buy the largest container of olive oil that I can afford, at least once a month.  We use olive oil for all of our cooking.  It can be used in place of butter on bread and with some vinegar and spices on salads as a dressing.  It can be used to make mayonnaise, it's a great moisturizer for one's skin, and it can be used as a preservative.   Olive oil is one of the \"good fats,\" and while most Americans probably don't need more fat in their diets, the fact is that if we're looking at food shortages, getting the best nutrition possible out of the fewest food items should definitely be a priority.4.  Cured meats.There was this funny meme going around Facebook not long ago.  It was a screenshot of a tweet from a twenty-something woman who said she wanted to make a \"Shark Cootchie\" board.  She, of course, meant \"charcuterie,\" and I actually found it even more funny, because the word, chatcuterie doesn't mean, \"a platter with meats and cheeses.\"  It actually refers to the process of curing meat, like guanciale, pepperoni, and salami.  The practice of making these shared platters has certainly increased the appeal of some of these cured meats, but I think there's still a bit of trepidation about stocking up on them, even in the prepper world, because they feel like snack foods, or something to put on pizza.  The thing is that they can be a whole lot more.  This page gives 17 different ways to use salami.Curing meats is a time-honored way of preserving meat for long storage that doesn't require refrigeration.  In fact, many cured meats are shelf stable until the packaging is opened, which makes them great back-packing food and a favorite among hikers.  So, while everyone else is trying to claim that last package of fresh chicken wings or fighting it out in the canned meat aisle, smart preppers are quietly filling their carts with links of salami, pepperoni, and summer sausage. 5.  Canned pie filling.When I went to the grocery store on that day before Maine went into lockdown, I was shocked by the bare shelves where canned goods, sauces, and pasta would normally have been.  I don't buy a lot of canned foods, in general.  We're more likely to buy it fresh, and then, I can it myself.  Sometimes, though, having a few commercially canned foods as a back-up isn't a bad thing.  A couple of years ago, I had this very unexpected craving for cherry pie.  I went to the store, and there in the baking section, I found this whole shelf of pie filling options.  Yes, they are full of sugar, but this particular brand is also marked with the 'non-GMO' symbol, and so, HUZZAH!  I bought a couple of cans of cherry pie filling, which I ate straight from the can, with a spoon, because I can't have pie crust anyway.  Delicious!Then, I thought, I would try the peach, which led to picking up a couple of cans of blueberry, and even though I make my own canned applesauce, I decided to try their apple pie filling, too.  It's definitely not an every day food.  But when all of the other canned food items were flying off the shelf, I still found pie filling, which is interesting.  Of course, there are more gems in that pie filling section than just the sugary options.  There are also cans of pumpkin, that can be made into pies, breads, and SOUP!  So, when everyone else was stripping the aisles of every canned fruit, vegetable, meat, sauce, and soup, I moseyed on over to the baking aisles, walked past the empty flour section, grabbed a couple of packages of cornmeal and added several cans of pie filling to my cart.  Dinner at my house may not be traditional, but it's filling and tasty.  And when everyone else is fighting for the same stuff, I'm standing in the corner laughing and licking the blueberry pie filling off the spoon. BONUS Suggestion:A couple of years ago I read the book, Lucifer's Hammer.  The story opens with scientists seeing an asteroid heading toward the Earth.  They won't just say it's going to hit.  Instead they hem and haw about it.  Some people are certain it will, and they begin prepping.  Some hold off for several days, and then, by the time they are ready to believe that IT is actually going to happen, what they find at the grocery store looks a lot worse than March 12, 2020 here in Maine.  To say pickings were slim is an understatement, as this character discovers.I was impressed with what he chose.  He picked up some expensive cuts of beef, like roasts, and salt and pepper.  He took it home and made jerky.  Wowsa!  What an idea!But it got me thinking - not about making jerky, but about seasonings, and since then, I have always been very careful to have a fully stocked seasonings cabinet.  I always have salt and pepper (I prefer very coarse ground pepper, and usually buy peppercorns, which I grind myself).  We also use a lot of garlic and onion.  Cumin, chili powder, cayenne, and paprika are favorites.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves are always in my spice cabinet.  And I have a lot of both dried and fresh herbs from my garden.  I never buy spice mixes (like taco seasoning).  I just always make sure I have the ingredients on hand to make my own.  Food is necessary, but it should also be something that we enjoy.  When the SHTF, I didn't have any trouble finding spices and seasonings, which was great - for me!  But if I am giving advice to preppers, I say, stop in the spice aisle.  Learning to use whole seasonings will add a layer of something wonderful to your diet.  You'll thank me.  I was very lucky that I've been doing this a while now, and so we never needed to stock up.  I just needed to keep my pantry stocks level throughout the whole mess.  I still haven't stocked up, per se, but I might add a couple of cans of pie filling to my cart every other shopping trip, and I might have a few vacuum sealed jars of popcorn in the pantry."},

{"title": "Things I Learned about Prepping from Working in a Theater", "date": "Saturday, October 10, 2020", "text": "I have been working as a manager at a local community theater for almost three years, and before that, my family and I volunteered at that same theater for over half a decade.  The Theater was and is as much a part of our lives as our homestead.One day, I realized that the two activities were actually a lot more similar than one might think.  In fact, working at the Theater has, in a lot of ways, made me a better prepper.  Here's how:It is not hoarding if you're going to use it someday. There's a joke in Theater that The Phantom of the Opera couldn't possibly be real, because any director/theater manager worth his salt would find that hidden cavern and use it for prop storage. At the Theater where I work, we have a huge prop room with floor to ceiling shelves, and it's so packed with everything from fake flowers and baskets to old books and teapots that there's just a three-foot wide path from one door to the other.  That's just what's at the Theater.  We also have a separate storage space for additional props and set pieces.   Our costume storage is three times the size of our prop storage, and we try to keep everything from custom-made vests worn by the monkeys in The Wizard of Oz production we did to the donated mink \"scarves\" complete with faces.In Theater, we never know what we will use, because we don't have a crystal ball telling us what shows we might do in five years, or even next fall, which is why we keep everything we can find a place for, and why we are shy about turning down donations.  Sometimes what someone else might discard can be incredibly useful for us.    The same is true of prepping. We never know what we might need, which is why we preppers often get mislabeled hoarders, but here's the thing.  I have (probably too many) boxes of old clothes.  I save t-shirts and jeans that are too stained or ripped, or sometimes if they were from a personal, very specific event (like a t-shirt from a dance show my daughters performed in).  I also keep things, like, elastic from panties and boxer shorts.   Every now and then, I will go through my stash and clean things out, but I almost always regret it.Recently, two things happened.  We ended up in a pandemic that resulted in a statewide mandate to wear a mask in public places.  I work very hard to avoid disposable products in my home.  For instance, we don't use paper towels or napkins.  Instead we have a bunch of cloth napkins, for when we use them, and I have old towels and t-shirts cut into rags to replace paper towels.  So, using a disposable face mask was also not happening.  Not to mention that at the beginning of the Pandemic, we couldn't even buy disposable masks. We also couldn't buy elastic, which means if I hadn't been a hoarder of strange things, like old underwear, I wouldn't have been able to make masks.  Deus Ex Machina wears his masks with the elastic that says, \"Victoria's Secret\", and he gets a few chuckles and sideways glances from his co-workers. The second thing was that in the middle of the lockdown period, my daughter had a birthday, and I decided to make her a quilt for her birthday using old shirts from her dance days.  I had enough shirts that I was able to make a large couch throw.  I even had enough material hoarded … er, stored … to give the quilt a back and some batting in between the two layers.Sometimes, trying to find something in my house can be frustrating, because I have so much stuff, but those times when I need what I've saved, I am incredibly thankful.Skills can really make the difference.In Theater we often have to customize things.  For example, we did a show and was having trouble finding a costume that was the right size for the actress.  We needed a costume for her that was from the late 1800s, and we were doing a \"Steampunk\" inspired version of the show set during that time period.   Having someone on staff who could actually sew was invaluable.  Our costumer/seamstress made a custom dress for this actress in less than a day. For that same show, we also needed aprons – not just any apron, but a very specific design, because it theater, it is all about making things LOOK a certain way.  So, it's not enough to just put an apron on the actress.  It has to fit the overall theme and style of the story. But it also has to fit.  So, we made three aprons, all custom fit to the actresses who wore them.  A custom dress from the Victorian Era can run over $300 and the aprons that we made would have been over $30 each, if we had purchased them, and then, they might not have fit properly. Sets are also custom made for the shows.  Finding a piano that is ornate enough to sit in Mr. Laurence's parlor in Little Women, but that can also be moved off and on the stage by just one or two people would be impossible.  Having someone custom make a piano (not one that actually works, but that's another topic) is what we do here.  Fake furniture can't look fake, and having a talented set designer who is also a finish carpenter is incredibly valuable.But it's not just the stuff that happens before the curtain goes up.  There are often little mishaps during the run of the show that need attention – like a zipper breaking during a costume change or a button popping off.  Those things do happen, and having someone back stage who can fix them on the fly is incredibly useful.  Maybe it doesn't save the show, but it certainly makes it less worrisome for the people on the stage to know that their zipper is fixed.Skill building – especially those basic skills that allow us to customize – is essential in prepping.  Above I mention making masks.  Because I can sew, I can repair and make clothes.  I can make quilts.  I can make feminine hygiene products and diapers that are as good as (comfort-wise and absorbency-wise) as the high-tech disposables. The hallmark of a successful prepper is someone who can be self-sufficient.  Having carpentry skills, sewing skills, cooking skills, and other DIY skills means not having to pay someone to do little projects, and that, alone, is incredibly valuable.  Most people won't look too close, if what they see at a glance looks real enoughThere's this common understanding in Theater that if a thing looks good from ten feet away, then it will be fine.  For instance, stage make-up close up can be startling, but from the audience, it can actually make the actor look better.  It's all about the façade.I started to call this item something about camouflage, because that's what it's about.  It's about showing one thing, when that thing is actually something else.  In Theater, we have real working doors on our sets that go nowhere.  Well, they go behind the set, and the room into which the character disappears is implied.  A lot of stuff is implied in Theater, but that's okay, because the audience is willing to fill in the blanks and make whatever isn't there, appear.In prepping, sometimes we have things that look like one thing, but are actually something else.  Hollowed out books for storing valuables.  Pretty flowers that are actually food.  Bean bags filled with dried beans that are actually edible.  Storing supplies right where they can be seen, but in such a way that it's over looked, is a fantastic prepper technique. What's happening behind the scenes is as important as what's being shown.In Theater the folks on the stage are only a piece of the show. There are about a million things happening in the background that the audience never sees.  When Roger Debris runs off stage after accepting the fact that he's going to have to perform the lead in the play-within-a-play in the musical The Producers, the actor (not the character) has less than 5 minutes to become the next character.  As an audience member, what you will never see is that person who is standing in the wings, holding a wig, a mustache, and a bottle of water, and while the actor is chugging the cold water, that person is tucking pants in boots and fixing wigs.  That person is a \"dresser\", and for really fast changes, they are an essential piece of the success of the show.  There often isn't enough time for a full costume change without someone to help zip zippers and remember hats, gloves, and scarves, but when the music starts, the actor, fully changed, needs to be on the stage to sing those opening notes.  It's all about timing and stealth.  We can't let the audience know that we're back there holding the wig.  The actor just needs to magically appear on the stage with the wig on.  It's magic.  There's a kind of magic in prepping, too.  It's not the \"show the world this\" and \"hide this from the world\" kind of magic that happens in Theater, but it is the kind of magic that happens when everyone is working toward the same goal and we all know that we can depend on each other.  In Theater, the actors need the stage crew to keep things running smoothly.  The crew assists with costume changes and set changes, keeps track of props, makes sure there is water or other needs met, and keeps the chaos that is backstage in the middle of a play from erupting.  Every day preps – ordering the seeds, weeding the garden, canning the harvest, darning a sock, tending the flock of chickens, setting up the rain barrels in the spring and emptying them before it gets cold enough for them to freeze.  It's those little things, those unsexy tasks that someone has to do, and for which there is no spotlight and applause, but it has to be done, and when it is all working in sync, when the backstage crew is doing its job, no one, sometimes not even the actors, know they are there.  And that's the magic.Stay calm. Live Theater isn't like film.  There are no second takes if mistakes are made or mishaps occur.  What happens on the stage, happens.  Live theater is kind of like life, in that respect.  We can practice our lines until saying them sounds like we're talking to an old friend rather than reciting words someone else wrote.  We can sing the songs until the lyrics become our daily soundtrack.  We can sew beautiful costumes and have sets that are so realistic, we want to move into that living room.   And then, it's opening night, and there are people clapping and laughing (we hope), and something happens.  A shoe breaks.  A zipper gets stuck.  A china cup gets dropped and smashes on the stage. Someone forgets the words to the song or the next line.  Things happen.  The key is to stay calm and just do the next thing.In the decade that I have been involved in the Theater, I have never seen anything so bad happen on the stage that it ruined the show.  One time, in the middle of the show, the actor's guitar string broke.  He and the other actors on the stage stayed calm.  They ad-libbed while he tried to fix the string, but as soon as he got that one fixed, another one broke.  Finally, he says to the pianist (who was also the music director, and so obviously knew the score), \"Hey, man, how would you like to accompany me on this next song?\"  It worked!  The audience was none the wiser, and the show went on.    That is absolutely the best ever advice for Preppers, but also just for life.  Things happen, and even after we've made as many solid and sound plans as we can, things happen, and we just have to take a deep breath and get to the next thing.   Improvise, be flexible, but most of all, stay calm.    It's funny how much being a prepper has made my work in the Theater so much easier.  Or maybe working in the Theater has made me a better prepper.  Either way, it was fun to realize that these two, seemingly contradictory activities that dominate my life, are actually complimentary. How has your job complemented your prepper lifestyle?"},
{"title": "The Future We Were Promised?", "date": "Thursday, October 8, 2020", "text": "I have been doing some freelancing for a non-profit.  The job is to make a one to three minute video each week using a prompt, and the goal is to flood the Internet with something other than poison politics.A couple of weeks ago, the prompt I chose asked me to respond to the question:  Where is the future we were promised?  The question has to do with the Jetson-style future many of us grew up believing we would inherit, and the intent of the prompt seemed to be asking us to lament the fact that we don't have flying cars and robot maids.  Where is that amazing high tech future we were promised?  It implied.Me, being me, I put a twist on it.  I actually explored the notion that we ARE living in the future we were promised.I mean, compared to MY youth, the youth today have things pretty high tech.  Little computers in their pockets, for one.  I didn't have all of the knowledge of the world available to me with the swipe of a screen small enough to fit into my hand.  I couldn't connect in real-time with my friend, Donna, when I moved to Kentucky and she still lived in Alabama, or my friend, Gregor, when he moved back to Germany.  I couldn't place an order at 8:00AM on Monday morning, get a confirmation of that order by 8:10AM on Monday morning, and be opening the package and enjoying my stuff by Wednesday.  Back in those days, we were conditioned to expect a four to six week wait for anything we ordered.  We didn't have voice activated computers that could tell us the weather or play our favorite song, or even help us figure out the artist and title of a song of which we could only remember a snippet of a line. We couldn't watch movies on demand.Our cars didn't talk to us, and if we needed \"route guidance\", it meant we either stopped and asked directions, or we learned how to read a map.In my opinion, we are living in a pretty high-tech future, even if we don't have flying cars.We do have self-driving cars, though - like Johnny Cab from Total Recall.  And we have talking houses - like in Blade Runner.  As for the real future we're living versus the one movies and books told us we'd get, in my opinion, we're also living out the warnings we failed to heed.  We have dying oceans, over population, a huge wealth divide (the rich keep getting richer), and genetically engineered foods, like in Soylent Green.  We have resource scarcity resulting in \"water wars\" like in Mad Max.And, like Stephen King's The Stand, we have our own pandemic that has ushered in TEOTWAWKI (the end of the world as we know it).  I mean, the world as I knew it this time last year did not include shortages of toilet paper, pasta, and tomato sauce; stay-at-home orders; a shuttering of Broadway and most live theater across the world; and government mandated face masks.I guess the real question is, which future do we think we were promised, and how is that vastly different than what we are living?As I say in my video, I think we are living the future we were promised, and the more we lean on technology to make our lives better, the more dystopian our future will become.  =================================This is an ad-free blog.  I have looked at different ways to monetize this blog, because (obviously) as a writer, I would prefer to get paid for my craft, but I dislike advertising, as I feel it is invasive, and frankly, I gave up my television, because I was tired of feeling like there was something wrong with my life because I lacked A, B, or C product.  I also dislike thinking of my readers as the \"product\" rather than the \"customer\" in the way that Facebook users are the product for the paid advertisers.  It changes how we relate to one another.As such, I have decided against paid links, pop-up ads, and services like Ad Sense.   That said, if you like what you see, please feel free to donate.  ======================================Any products mentioned on my blog are things I actually use and find useful.  They are not paid advertisements.  If I'm mentioning it, it's because I want you, my reader, to know about it."},
{"title": "Prepping at the Party Store", "date": "Tuesday, October 6, 2020", "text": "My youngest daughter developed a passion for special effects make-up.  Make-up artistry is not a skillset that I have ever thought to cultivate.  In fact, I barely wear street make-up, I never paint my fingernails, and the first time I ever colored my hair was during the COVID lockdown (and that was because my daughter needed to practice and the only people she had access to who had uncolored hair were me and Deus Ex Machina).As a homeschooler, I like to encourage my daughters' passions - even if (maybe especially if) they don't align with my own, and what that means is, when she asks if we can go to the Party Store, because she needs a bald cap, I don't say no.  Besides, she has a job and she's spending her own money.  All I'm doing is providing transportation.Well, that's not entirely true.  When she asked if I could take her there, I immediately thought of the one thing that I know I can always find at the Party Store, and that's really useful - especially during power outages.  Chem Lights!From a prepper standpoint, these lights are pretty cool.  The first time I used these during a power outage, I was surprised by how much light they actually put out.  It was plenty of light for brushing my teeth.  I found the display of chem lights, grabbed a few packages, and continued to wander around the store while she stocked up on her FX make-up.As I wandered around, I noticed that there were actually quite a few things that are useful for preppers.  I was surprised, and then, I thought, \"Of course there are!\"  Because Prepping doesn't have to be about specialized equipment.  It really is about seeing the usefulness in every day items. So, I started taking pictures of things that I saw that I knew were incredibly useful \"prepper\" items.  Here's my list of 9 prepper items I found at the Party Store.1. BandanasEvery hiker, survivalist, and prepper knows that bandanas are incredibly useful.  They can be used for all sorts of things, from pressure bandages to water filters.  Today, with the pandemic raging, bandanas are a popular face covering.  The Party Store has lots of options for bandanas, and what I found particularly aesthetically pleasing was that the bandanas were sorted by color with other fun things that were all the same color.  I'm particularly fond of purple.  2. Socks.I love socks.  As a soldier, I learned the value of dry socks, because dry feet are healthy feet.  Later in life, when I moved to New England and quickly figured out that wearing sweaters and socks was cheaper than paying for heating oil, I learned the true value of a good pair of socks.  The best advice for keeping warm in cold weather is to start small - with one's own body.  Layering clothes is the oft given advice in survival circles.  When I'm cold, instead of turning up the heat, I put on socks.  It's amazing what a difference it makes.  I don't know why I was surprised to find socks at the Party Store.  I'm sure one can find cheaper socks, but if the Party Store is the only option, they have socks, and socks are good.  3.  Tee ShirtsRight under the socks I found tee-shirts.  Like a bandana, a nice, cotton tee-shirt has dozens of uses - including the fact that it can be worn as, well, a shirt.  In a survival situation, clean, dry clothes can help prevent hypothermia and provide cover from the sun, and *clean* clothes can help prevent body lice.  Body lice are parasites that feed on humans, but they LIVE in clothes.  Changing clothes, frequently, can prevent lice.  Just FYI.  4.  Hats!I love hats!  I can't wear hats, because I don't look good in hats, but I still love them, and I dream of someday being a little old lady in a big purple straw hat tending my garden or putting laundry on the line.   I never really appreciated the value of hats, especially for providing shade, until I was in the military.  For keeping the sun off one's head and out of one's eyes, there's not much better than a hat with a wide brim.  As a prepper, hats are great for sun shade.  They can also be good as a collection basket when foraging.   5.  Lip balm.I apologize for the terrible pictures.Lip  balm is great for its intended purpose - to provide a protective layer on one's lips.  It's good for helping to prevent/sooth lips chapped by the cold or sun.  6.  Magnifying glasses.Magnifying glasses can be used as a fire starter.  They can also be used in first aid.  Ever get a stubborn splinter?  That magnifying glass can be very helpful when trying to get it out.  In addition, for those of us with \"old\" eyes, a magnifying glass could be very useful if something happens to our glasses.  6.  A whistle.For those of you who haven't seen Titanic, spoiler alert!In the film, Rose is lying on a piece of a door in the frigid north Atlantic waters.  She is suffering from hypothermia and likely to pass out and die at any moment, when she hears rescuers slowly moving through the debris of the shipwreck looking for survivors.  She tries to call out, but she can not speak.  Then, she sees a whistle around the neck of a floating corpse.  That whistle saves her life.  Survival manuals recommend a whistle in one's gear for that reason.  We can't always count on the ability to call out if we're in danger, but blowing a whistle - we can do that.  7.  Hand SanitizerHand sanitizer may not be a usual offering at the Party Store, but it was there (along with face masks, which I am not including in this list).   While I don't, under normal circumstances, like using hand sanitizer, in a survival scenario, it can be useful.  Keeping clean without soap and water can be difficult.  Hand sanitizer is also made mostly of alcohol.  It could be used as an accelerant for fire starting. 8.  Carving tools.Pumpkin carving tools are likely seasonal, and for survival purposes, there are probably better cutting tool options, but if one only has the Party Store as a resource, this cutting tool could be useful.  9.  Lights.For the same reason that I like to stock-up on chem lights, I also look for lights, like these.  They are safer to use than candles, but provide enough light for basic tasks.  In a powered down scenario, I would love to have these lights under my kitchen cabinets or running down my hallway.  ================================One of the most useful attributes of preppers is our ability to look at every day items and see their value in extraordinary circumstances.  As I walked around the Party Store, I found a lot of great prepper supplies.  There are definitely other things I missed or didn't include, because they were no brainers (like all of the napkins, plastic spoons, and paper plates).  What prepper items have you found in unusual places?"},
{"title": "How to Make an Herbal Tincture", "date": "Sunday, August 30, 2020", "text": "Herbs arehighly valued for both their nutritive and medicinal value.  Addingherbs to foods can enhance the flavor and make what might be a blahmeal a wowza!In addition,herbal medicine has been used for centuries to treat health issues.  Herbs as medicine can be prepared as infusions (like a tea), salves,or tinctures.   There are different qualities for each of thepreparations.  For instance, infusions are often considered to bemore nutritutional than medicinal, in that they will be used as atonic or immune-boosting supplement, rather than to treat an illness,although they can be used in both ways.  A tincture ismost often considered a medicine and should be used with great care,as the process of making a tincture involves the extracting andconcentrating the medicinal qualities of the herb.  In short, atincture is like a turbo-charged version of the herb.  A tincture ismade by steeping herbs in alcohol, usually vodka or rum. According toSusan Weed, the process of making a tincture leeches the nutritionalvalue out of the herbs, but it enhances the herb’s medicinal value. As a Prepper,I wanted to learn to use herbs both in my kitchen and in my medicinecabinet.  It's not so much that I think herbs are inherently betterthan pharmaceuticals (although I do believe that herbs are a moregentle and more natural remedy for most non-life threateningailments), but as a Prepper, I am keenly aware that things happen. Systems break down.  Resources become scarce or depleted.  And thingsthat we take for granted, may not always be so readily available.  Inthe event that finding a doctor or getting OTC rash cream, becomesproblematic, I wanted alternatives.  When we first bought ourproperty, Deus Ex Machina and I resolved to only grow plants thatwere medical or edible.  What we found is that they are often both. For instance, everyone knows that Oregano is wonderful when added toMediterranean/Italian cuisine.  Oregano oil (which is extracted fromthe oregano plant using a distillation process) is also a powerfulimmune booster.  Cloves are fantastic in pumpkin pie, but the cloveoil can be used for dental issues, like a toothache.  It's thesemulti-purpose plants that found a home in my garden.  Jewel weed is awonderful pot herb when its young, but it's a really good treatmentfor poison ivy.Of course,growing the plant is only a portion of the process.  Once I figuredout what and how to grow it, then, I needed to figure out how to useit.

{"title": "Returning.", "date": "Tuesday, August 18, 2020", "text": "If I had to look back on the last six months and pinpoint the things that wildly deviated from our normal lifestyle, I couldn't.  There have been little things that were different.In July, I called my butcher.  We have been raising meat chickens for just about as long as my youngest daughter (who will be an adult this year) can remember.  I asked her before I wrote that, and she verified that she doesn't really remember not having chickens in our yard.  She was five when we got our first three hens.  That was the year that everything got all shook up, we started seriously looking into homesteading our quarter acre, and I started finding ways to transition us from a typical American diet to a mostly local diet.  During those early days, it was a challenge to have even one item in a meal that was local.  Creating a meal with ALL local foods was a huge and blog-worthy (with pictures) accomplishment.  Last night for dinner, we had pork chops (from the pig share) with cheesy baked potatoes (from our garden with cheese from a local creamery).  The night before that, we had tacos.  The only thing that wasn't local were the shells and the seasonings.  Everything else, including the homemade salsa, was Maine grown.  Last week we had chicken (we raised), cole slaw (cabbage from my garden), boiled eggs (from our hens), and buttered potatoes (from our garden with butter from a local creamery).  It was all local, except the dressings, and most of it was from my own yard.  In \"locavore\", we call that the 100 foot diet ;).  As the saying goes, \"We've come a long way, baby.\"So, when I called my butcher in July, and he hesitated before scheduling me that was a new thing for me.  In the decade - or more - that we have been raising meat birds, he has never hesitated to put me on the schedule.  This year, though, so many people, worried about the future, worried about their finances, worried about getting food from the grocery store, started to raise their own.  In March, just as I always have, I filled out my chick order forms at the local feed store.  I had my birds on order, just as I always have.  Then, I started hearing stories about people trying to find laying hens and/or meat birds, and there just not being any available.  All of the usual places where baby chicks are sold were completely out-of-stock.  I was lucky, I guess, that I have always pre-ordered mine.As with all years past, we split up the meat birds into a couple of different groups.  We only have a quarter of an acre, and so we can't really raise 50 birds at a time, like most folks do.  We place two to three orders of 10 to 15 birds each, to be received at intervals throughout the summer.  This year was no different.  I placed an order for hens in early April, for my first set of meat birds to arrive mid-May, and for the last set of meat birds to arrive mid-June.  The first group of 15 meat birds were ready to go to the butcher in early July, and so I called on a Friday to schedule for Monday, because my butcher only does chickens on Mondays.  He told me that the summer is usually their down time.  Not this year.  This year, they were full out, every Monday, butchering chickens, because so many people had decided that now was a good time to start learning to raise their own.While it makes me happy (really, it does) that so many people are finally getting bitten by the self-sufficiency bug, it's also a little sad, to me, that it took this emergency to spur people in this direction.  It's also a little ... annoying isn't exactly the right word, but it fits ... to come up against shortages for things that I have always done, because suddenly everyone else wants to do them, too.  But worse are the people who, then, act as if it's some new and great idea that they came up with.  Um ....  Yeah.   So, I scheduled my first set of 15, and my butcher asked if I would have more later.  See?  He knows that I raise meat birds, 10 to 15 at a time, over the whole summer.  I told him that I would.  He advised me to schedule to bring them in and gave me a date in the middle of August.  \"If they start to get too big,\" he told me (because Cornish-cross, which is the breed of meat chicken I raise, and he knows it, tend to grow really big, really fast.  It's exactly the reason I, and so many other people, raise them for meat), \"give us a call and we can see about fitting you in sooner.\"I didn't call.  The average meat chicken in the grocery store is around 3 lbs.  It's the same breed of chicken that I raise, but those birds are butchered at between five and eight weeks.  My chickens were probably ten to twelve weeks old when I took them to \"See Ken\" - our family's euphemism for taking the chickens to the butcher.  The largest was over 8 lbs fully dressed.It's not unusual for us to have such large chickens.  We've done it before. What is unusual is for us to have such large chickens, because the butcher was too busy to take my birds. Because I was home more, I had the best garden I have had in years.  I was able to do things this year that I have always wanted to do, but just didn't have the time - like successive plantings.  I planted lettuce in the spring.  We ate salads for a month.  Then, the lettuce started to bolt, because it got too warm.  I recently replanted lettuce for the fall.  I've never done that before.I also planted more potatoes.  I plant my potatoes in old feed sacks.  My first crop was planted in May.  I planted a second set of bags in June.  In July, I started harvesting potatoes from the bags I had planted in May, and because I had empty bags, I planted more potatoes.For seed, I used potatoes that were sprouting in my kitchen.  If I were a commercial potato farmer, I probably wouldn't want to plant those potatoes, because the crop is unreliable, and the potatoes are often small, but for my home garden, food grown from free seed is no small potatoes.  Also in the garden, I was able to really nurture a few of the volunteers.  I ended up with yellow squash that was growing from seeds thrown into my compost pile.  And my tomatoes, which were planted in buckets this year, THRIVED, because I was home more and was able to water them more regularly.Spending more time at home, I have been doing a lot more cooking.  Between not wanting to be out in public anyway, and there just not being any really good choices for take-out for us, because of some dietary restrictions (we are, by doctor recommendation, gluten-free), I've really had driven home the fact that my home cooking is just better than restaurant fare.  Not that I'm such a great chef, but mostly because when we eat at home, I have total control over what we consume.  So, locally sourced, organic, or home-grown ingredients were on the menu almost every day this summer.  The real benefit to my being home more was to our pocketbook.  Cooking at home saves us a lot of money.   Limiting trips to the store and/or shopping with a grocery delivery service eliminated most of those impulse purchases, which saved us a lot.  We also had time, this summer (usually we are really busy with work and volunteer stuff) to think about later in the year.  For the first time, in a long time, we have all the wood we need for the winter ... and then, some.   We heat, exclusively, with wood, which means a lot of wood.  We had five cords delivered, and it's stacked and ready for this winter.  We have a full freezer.  We have plenty of toilet paper.  A couple of projects that needed doing, but weren't a priority, got done, too.And, because we are uncertain of what this winter will hold, we've already started talking about holiday gift-giving, and we have some ideas of what we want to do.  For certain, we know that we will be shopping early for things we plan to buy, and starting earlier than usual with things we plan to make.  For me, this year has been a reminder of why we started doing things the way we do, and I have been given the opportunity to return to the lifestyle that makes me feel fulfilled."},
{"title": "Flashback - I'm a Prepper", "date": "Tuesday, July 7, 2020", "text": "The following is an essay that appeared on Surviving the Suburbs blog (my original blog) in 2017.  Given the current COVID-19 pandemic with the shortages in so many surprising and not surprising resources, I felt that highlighting those of us who've been doing this for a long time was appropriate.Enjoy the flashback ... and feel free to comment ... and invite your friends to comment ;).===============================================I'm a Prepper.I'm accustomed to that suspicious, sideways glance from people who learn that I'm a Prepper.  I'm accustomed to being judged for writing about the very real possibility that some catastrophic, life-changing event will happen in my lifetime - what we preppers like to call TEOTWAWKI (the end of the world as we know it) or when the SHTF (shit hits the fan).What I haven't gotten used to, however, is being openly ridiculed, called names like \"mouth breather\", labeled a luddite, or accused of having only a 5th grade education, simply because of my certainty that our way of life is neither sustainable nor non-negotiable, and because I refuse to become a victim, but rather choose to be proactive, and yes, prepared.   In 2015, Canadian writer, Leslie Anthony, who clearly believes himself to be of a superior stock, wrote exactly those things about the Prepper community.  In what was little more than a insult-laced, lazily researched essay full of nothing more than degrading epithets meant to characterize anyone who believes that things might be going to shit, Mr. Anthony derided an entire group of people - people who run the gamut from, as he calls them \"meth-fueled, neo-Christian, anarchist bow-hunters\" to professionals in all fields from accountants and teachers to doctors and engineers.  I'd also like to point out that some of the folks in the latter group are also bow-hunters ... and some in the former are also college-educated professionals.  Former President G.W. Bush owns an off-grid ranch in Texas that includes a 25,000 gallon cistern for storing water.  I'd call him a prepper.  Yours truly is just shy of a graduate degree (significantly more than a 5th grade education) and is married to an engineer with a degree from an Ivy League college.  I feel like Mr. Anthony doesn't really know what a prepper is, in spite of his insistence that he has a full understanding of what that term means and the kinds of people who wear the label. So, let's discuss who preppers really are, and why more people should strive to be like us. First let's start with the definition from the Oxford English Dictionary, which Mr. Anthony refers to as \"that most authoritative tome.\"  The definition of a prepper, as published by Mr. Anthony, from the OED is:  \"a person who believes a catastrophic disaster or emergency [edited to add: *cough* COVID-19 *cough] is likely to occur in the future and makes active preparations for it, typically by stockpiling food, ammunition, and other supplies.\" I don't disagree with that definition, and I would also like to point out that no where, in that definition, is a prepper defined as someone with no education who hopes for disaster.  Rather, by definition, a prepper is someone who is pretty sure that something bad is going to happen, and strives to be ready for it ... whatever the *it* is. So, let's talk about some of the \"its\" that have occurred recently.Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas causing severe flooding and massive damage, and Hurricane Irma, after thoroughly thrashing all of the islands in that area of the world where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean meet, descended on southern Florida with a fury only matched by a little league parent who is certain the referee has slighted his little star.Both of those events could be described as \"catastrophic disasters.\"  Prepping in the sense of stockpiling goods might not have done many people in the path of those hurricanes a lot of good, but Mr. Anthony also pokes fun at the \"Bug-Out Bag\", which is, usually a backpack filled with provisions and ready to be grabbed as one runs out the door.  There were many areas in Florida that were under mandatory evacuation.  So, you tell me, when is it better to plan for an evacuation - when you're being shouted at by the police to leave the area, or now, when you're sitting, calmly, in your living room reading this article?  When are you more likely to be able to think, rationally, about what you might need in the event of an emergency?When I was in college, the university provided low-cost housing to students who were married and/or had children.  It was a trailer park, and I lived there.  One evening when I was home alone with my two children, the police rolled through my neighborhood telling all of us that we needed to get out ... now!  A tornado had touched down nearby.  We were being evacuated.   I grabbed my kids, shoved a couple of diapers and a quick snack in my purse, and snatched up a ball - as something for my kids to play with.  It was a warm late spring day when we evacuated to the basement of a nearby building. Inside the bowels of that building, sitting on the marble floors, it was cold.  My children and I weren't dressed for the chill of the cold floor in the air conditioned building.  I didn't have a blanket.  I didn't have extra clothes for any of us.  Heck, my daughter didn't even have on shoes or socks (she was still a baby).  I didn't have water.  I didn't have any money.  The list of what I didn't have was pretty long, and thankfully, after two hours, we were sent back to our homes.  Nothing happened.  We were fine.  The house was still intact.  I hadn't lost anything except two hours of study time.  It could have been worse, though.  It could have been a lot worse.  That tornado could have destroyed my home, and I and my children could have been left with nothing more than the clothes on our backs, and the few silly things I hastily grabbed on my way out the door.  I didn't even have any identification for them, and I certainly didn't have any of my important papers.  If back then, I'd had a bug-out bag, we would have had everything we needed, plus a lot more, and those other people who were stuck in that cold basement would have been really grateful when I pulled out blankets and snacks.    Later in my life, I experienced other SHTF events.  These, like the tornado evacuation, were always short-lived, but the fact that I was prepared those times made my life a heck of a lot easier. In 2008, much of the northeast was hit with a significant ice storm.  It was the second such storm I'd experienced since I'd moved to Maine a decade earlier.  The worst part of this storm, for my family, was that we were without electricity for a few days.  So, imagine.  It's the middle of winter.  There is no electricity in your house.  Quick!  What do you do? Can you heat your house?  Can you cook meals?  Do you have candles, flashlights, or oil lamps? Would you even be able to stay in your house for the duration of the event?  Would your pipes freeze? Would you be able to care for your pets or, like too many people did during the recent hurricane emergencies, would you be forced to abandon them? Some folks ended up in a hotel or a motel ... if they could find one that still had power and vacancies.We stayed home.We played games.We read books.We even rigged up the FM transmitter that we keep in our car (and is usually powered by the car lighter) so that we could listen to an audiobook through the solar-powered radio. On day two of our power outage, Deus Ex Machina's nephew came over to our house to spend the day, because there was no school.  He asked us what we did all day with no television, and so my daughters showed him.  They played some games.  They made origami animals.  They colored.  They danced and sang.   I made lunch on the wood stove.In the mornings, I heated water on the wood stove.  We had hot baths.  We had coffee.  We were able to wash dishes. In the evenings, we had plenty of light with my stockpile of candles, oil lamps, and flashlights.  Dinner, including fresh baked bread, was cooked on the wood stove. On day three of our power outage, Deus Ex Machina went to work in the morning, just like usual, and I hooked my computer and transcriber up to the car jump-starter and did my job, too. The day the power company crew came to my neighborhood to restore our electric service, I was hanging my freshly laundered clothes on the line outside. Not much about our lives changed significantly ... because we are prepared.  We don't have a generator, but we know for a fact that we can survive without electricity without any hardship at all.And without scrambling to buy a generator or running to the store for supplies, because, thanks to our prepper mind-set, we usually have most of what we need.There are some Prepper-fantasy scenarios that are a little far-fetched - more likely to occur in fiction than in real life.  All sorts of novels cover the possibility of a solar flare or an EMP attack that completely destroys all electronics, or a viral plague that wipes out 90% of the human race. Mostly those events are fiction, but both of them can happen, and have-ish. To wit:  a solar storm (coronal mass ejection or CME) known as the Carrington Event knocked out telegraph transmissions in 1859.  If a similar event occurred in the US today, it could destroy significant parts of the electrical grid, and knock out power in some parts of the country for months ... maybe longer.  Such an event could happen and would be catastrophic.  It probably won't, though.  And, while an EMP, which would have a similar effect, can be accomplished by detonating a nuclear bomb up in the stratosphere (or, you know, up in the clouds, up there someplace), it probably won't happen, either.  You know, it's not like North Korea has nuclear bombs or anything, or that they don't like us.  Oh ... wait.As for plagues, those have also happened.  In the Middle Ages, the Bubonic Plague wiped out much of Europe (although some research is also suggesting that it wasn't just the Black Plague, but a combination of pestilence, including bacillus anthracis, or Anthrax).  Of course, that was a very long time ago, and we have a vaccinations these days.  But ...Ebola is pretty awful.  There's no vaccine.  It probably won't spread to the rest of the world, but from 2014 to 2016, several West African countries fought to keep the disease from spreading. People were ordered to quarantine themselves in their homes.  So, imagine that you can't leave your house.  Can you feed yourself?  Do you have water?  Can you cook your food?  Can you heat your home?  Ebola probably won't happen HERE, where I live, but it did happen somewhere.  The Preppers in West Africa were living well in their quarantined, well-stocked homes. Let's talk about some other possibilities that are not just crazy, \"out there\" ideas that are just never going to happen here, but rather some real scenarios that really could happen, over which we would have absolutely NO control, but for which we could be somewhat prepared. In the 1990s, the USSR collapsed.  The USSR, or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was a massive entity in Eurasia that was formed just after World War I.   Land wise, it was huge.  We collectively referred to them as the Soviet Union, and most of us here in America thought they were all \"Russians\", but the USSR was actually made up of 15 different countries with several more countries, sort of, being controlled by the government in Moscow. So, when the USSR collapsed, it was pretty catastrophic for a lot of people.  The Russians retreated back to Russia where there were shortages of everything.  Dmitry Orlov, who grew up in the US, but visited family in Russia, tells great stories about what he saw during his visits behind the curtain of how the people were dealing with the financial collapse.Argentina, Cuba, Greece, and Venezuela have all recently experienced their own financial collapses, and lest you think it can't happen here, please note that Venezuela is one of the top oil producing countries in this world.  They should have plenty of money to sustain their economy.  Unlike Venezuela, the US does not have its own supply of oil.  If, by some crazy happenstance (oh, I don't know, like the 1970s OPEC-led oil embargo against the US), we lose our oil suppliers, things would be very bad. If you want a very small glimpse of how it might look to have less oil available, and at a much higher price, do some research on what happened to Cuba when Russia stopped supplying the Cubans with oil.   Or, perhaps, just harken back to 2008, right here in the good ole US of A, when the price of gasoline skyrocketed, almost overnight, and everyone freaked out.  Truckers went on strike in protest of the high prices.  Goods weren't delivered.  It wasn't too bad, but it could have been.Shit happens all of the time, and being prepared for the \"it\" is not a bad thing.One of the most popular lists for preppers is the 100 items list.  It was originally compiled by a survivor of the Sarajevo siege.  I'm sure you're thinking, why should I care about Sarajevo?In 1992, Sarajevo was a beautiful, modern city.  It is the capital of Bosnia and hosted the 1984 Olympics.  That year (1992) opposing military factions laid siege to the city, trapping civilians inside the urban confines. The Siege has the distinction of being the longest in the history of modern warfare and lasted almost four years.Thirteen years ago, I found this graphic novel, Fax from Sarajevo, at my library.  I had no idea what I was borrowing.   The story was horrifying in its harrowing details.  The civilians who lived in the city were constantly being shot at.  These were just regular people.  A man and his wife and their children, struggling not to get killed as these two opposing armies fought each other.  If that wasn't bad enough, they also needed stuff to stay alive, like food and clean water.  No supplies came in.  No one got out. Those cartoon images have stayed with me. It is unlikely that southern Maine will end up in a siege.  But ... I'm almost positive that if I found Doc Emmett Brown and bartered a ride in his Delorean back to 1984, and I was able to buy a ticket to the Olympics and visit Sarajevo, and talk to the people who lived there, not one of them would express the belief that their beautiful city would be torn asunder by war in eight years.  They'd probably laugh at me.  Loudly.  And point and jeer.Kind of like Mr. Anthony did in 2015 in his nasty little anti-prepper diatribe.But the reality - for a lot of people in this world - is that the shit hits the fan all of the time.  War happens, and usually, it happens in places and to people who aren't thinking it could ever happen to them, like most of us living in the US.  War doesn't happen here, right?  In 1991, that is exactly what they were saying in Sarajevo.I'm also pretty sure that in 2014 no one in Sierra Leone expected that their country would be home to more than 14,000 cases of a deadly and virulent hemorrhagic fever.And if I could go back to a 4th of July party in Houston, not one of my fellow party-goers would believe me if I tried to warn them that they would be under a three-day siege from a Hurricane with the same name as some actor from the Carol Burnett comedy show.Our mantra as humans is \"It won't happen to me.\"The difference between the Mr. Anthonys of this world and the Preppers he derides is that we, Preppers, DO believe it can (and probably will) happen to us, and instead of throwing up our hands in defeat, we decide to do something about it.He can laugh, if he wants, but come winter, if Maine experiences another electricity stealing ice storm, I'll be living life, pretty much, as usual.A final word:There are a lot of SHTF scenarios.  Some are huge events that are devastating to a lot of people, like most of the ones I mentioned.  All of the ones I mentioned HAVE happened, and millions of people were adversely affected by them.  With the exception of the catastrophic CME, all of them have happened somewhere in the world in MY lifetime.  I've been a witness, peripherally, to most of the catastrophic events that we, preppers, are hedging against.But there's one more, and every one of us is likely to experience that SHTF scenario.  The last one is a job loss or some significant financially devastating event (like an illness). Deus Ex Machina and I went through the job loss event this summer.  It wasn't bad for us, because we have a prepper mindset, because we are always aware that this modern way of life is not sustainable and not non-negotiable, and because we know that things can change on a whim, and do.Deus Ex Machina found a job.   We didn't lose our home.  No one starved.  We didn't have to sell our kidneys ... or our children.   We didn't sell our cars or our furniture or our clothes to make ends meet. We didn't have to rehome our pets because we couldn't feed them.  We didn't have to take out loans or end up with credit card debt.  We're still happily married and happily together.In fact, with the exception of having an awesome summer together with no one having to get up early every day to go to work, our lives didn't change all that much.Honestly, the whole tone of Leslie Anthony's article was condescending, and yes, as a Prepper, I was deeply insulted.  I guess, I just think, as a highly educated \"scientist\" kind of guy, we should expect  more from him than just a nine paragraph rant about a demographic he clearly doesn't care to understand.Maybe, instead of just trolling through a couple of Prepper websites, Mr. Anthony should have done some real research ... you know, like an actual scientist or journalist should be doing ... and gone out and actually met some of the real people in the Prepper world.  If he had done his due diligence, I'm certain his article would have had a very different tone.But then, if he'd met some real preppers, he would have had to hop down off his soap box and admit that real-life Preppers are more than a reality show caricature.==========================================[edited to add]And now that the world is in the midst of one of those \"catastrophic\" events, now that billions have been locked down and/or quarantined, millions have lost their jobs, and hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost to this disease, I wonder what naysayers, like Mr. Anthony are saying.To be clear, this isn't my \"I told you so\" moment, because we aren't done with this.  COVID-19 and its aftermath will be with us for a while.  We still don't know what the overall economic impact will be.  Things are still scarce.  People are still afraid.  At a minimum, we'll have to keep wearing that god-awful mask, and my job, as an office manager at a community theater, is in jeopardy, since we can't have folks congregating in enclosed spaces and theaters are, as a result, closed.  I don't feel \"I told you so.\"  This is not a laughing time.  It is a time for us to take stock of where we go from here.For those of you who were preppers before all of this began:  how do you feel about your preparations?   For those of you who weren't preppers:  what's your plan for the future?Here at Chez Brown, we were well prepped.  In fact, because I had to come home to work, but Deus Ex Machina was considered an \"essential worker\" and still went to his job, our lives actually went back to what they were pre-2018, when I owned a home-based business.  It was nice. I had more time - and energy - to tend to my space: housekeeping, garden, cooking - all thrived during my lockdown.We discovered new ways to get what we needed (curbside pick-up for the win!!).  We discovered new businesses (hooray!  Locally caught fish!).  We found a couple of really cool home delivery services for products we would never have considered having home delivered (there's a wine service that home delivers - I didn't subscribe, but how cool is that!). We returned to doing things we'd done before, staying home, spending time, doing things. For us, it was nice to be reminded of what is important and to return to those activities."},
{"title": "Haircut or Hugs?", "date": "Thursday, April 16, 2020", "text": "On FB today a friend posed the question - at this point in our \"social distancing\", would you prefer a haircut or a hug?When I was in high school, I learned to cut my own hair using a book my mother had purchased.  I have no idea why she bought that book, but it was like a lot of things we had - a very eclectic mix of \"why do we have that?\"  \"Hey, look what we have!!!\" that has framed how I live my own life.  I have a lot of both, and usually (like the elastics I mentioned in my previous post), I find out why I thought I needed that thing sometime later, and I get to pause and give thanks for the foresight that prompted me to keep whatever it is. Several years ago, in an effort to become more self-sufficient, which (for us) translated to \"save money\", I started cutting Deus Ex Machina's hair.   We have a pair of clippers, which I use to cut the sides, and then, I trim the top with scissors. The other day, I gave Deus Ex Machina a haircut.  When I was done, I said, \"You could start a juicy rumor that you're sleeping with your hairdresser.\" The longer we stay home, and the more stuff I read on social media about other people's experiences, the more I realize how capable we have become at this whole DIY thing.  Fact is, we really have learned a lot over the years, and I guess we kind of take it all for granted, because we don't need to go out for a haircut.  We don't need to commission someone else to make us masks.  We don't need to pay for take-out.What skills are you thankful for having learned that have helped you get through this quarantine?"},
{"title": "Mad Skills", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2020", "text": "When I was in high school, Home Ec. was a graduation requirement for all students.  Most kids took the general Home Ec. class, usually as a freshman or sophomore to get it out of the way.I, being a sophisticated young woman with career aspirations beyond being a housewife (oh, Fate!  You are so very, very funny!), I put off taking Home Ec.  I think my actual goal was to find a way to get out of having to take it at all. That goal didn't quite work out for me, thankfully, and as it turns out, taking Home Ec. proved to be incredibly beneficial to me.I didn't take the basic home ec. course.  It's a very long story that revolves around my having been an Army Brat and moving into a new community as a high school freshman, but having earned some high school credits in junior high school, and discovering that those credits would not transfer to my new high school, and then, attempting to retake those high school level classes - for the credits I had already earned - but discovering that my school would not allow me to retake a class that I was very much too advanced for.  Like I said, long story.The short of it is, basically, I had a open slot in my schedule.  I needed Home Ec., but the only option for me at that time of day was to take an advanced Home Ec. sewing class. And that's what I did. I didn't, particularly, want to learn to sew, but it ended up being one of the most valuable classes that I had in my entire four year high school career.When I started college, my great-aunt gifted me her sewing machine.  I put it to good use sewing my own maternity clothes. Later, I used the machine to sew Christmas gifts and make clothes for my kids. After a few moves and some life-altering events, the machine got lost in time, but then, Deus Ex Machina's grandmother gave me her old machine.  It felt like being reacquainted with an old friend.I've made a lot of things on that machine, including costumes for the Theater, where I am now employed. My most recent project is making face masks for friends and family as a layer of protection against this COVID-19 outbreak when we are out in public.Prepping is not just about food and \"survival\" supplies.  At its core, prepping is a little like fortune telling - and the ability to look at something for its potential.  The result, for me, is that I have not had to purchase any materials for our masks, because, as a prepper, I have kept old clothes and bed sheets over the years, because those things are fabric, and fabric has dozens of uses:  rags (instead of paper towels); rag rugs; feminine hygiene products; quilts; other clothes.  In the future, those old tee-shirts  are very likely to become \"family cloth\" (to take the place of toilet paper).As I mentioned in a previous post, 1/4\" elastic is hard to find.  One of the things that I've kept over the years is elastic - from worn out pairs of panties. I kept the elastic, because it's elastic, and because over the years I've used a lot of elastic in the clothes I've made for my children (in particular, pajama pants).   It seemed wasteful to be throwing away this perfectly good elastic, and then, purchasing more of it so that I could make things for my kids.I have also kept old flannel bed sheets.  The fabric is great for all sorts of projects, and as it turns out, flannel is one of the preferred fabrics for making the face masks.  After I started making masks, I realized an additional benefit of having saved all of those flannel sheets - elastic!  The fitted sheets have 1/4\" elastic!I've used at least a yard (one yard = three feet) of elastic in the past week on the masks I've made, and not only am I incredibly thankful to the Fates who pushed me into that sewing class, but also that I somehow had the foresight to hang on to all of those old clothes, flannel sheets, fabric remnants, and sewing notions.  It's come in handy - even if it looks a lot like clutter."},
{"title": "The Elephant in the Room", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2020", "text": "It's the only thing that anyone is talking about these days, but it's also the only topic no one wants to discuss.  It's that proverbial elephant - COVID-19.We're quarantined, mostly, although there are those individuals who are \"essential\" and still have to go to work everyday, and so, while, as a prepper, I have spent much of the last decade reading all about things just like this and what to do, the actual \"on the ground\" experience looks a LOT different than what we imagined back in the day. First off, there are no zombies.  There are no blood or pus spewing contagious folks infecting all of us at the grocery store.  In fact, it's a little anti-climatic.  I mean that in a positive way.  What we preppers imagined was a lot MORE than what we are currently experiencing.  People seem to be walking around in a daze.  The reality is a lot quieter.I think that's always the case, though.  When we are living it, the *it* always looks different in the moment than it does in hindsight.  In a few years, we'll look back on this time and do some great analysis.  Books - both fiction and non-fiction - will be written about our individual COVID-19 experiences.  There will be dozens of \"front-line\" first person accounts from doctors and nurses.  I'm looking forward to the grocery store clerk diaries, personally.  I've been shopping at the same grocery store for the past two decades, and I know many of the cashiers and stock-people by name, and they know me by sight.  In the past few weeks, when I've gone to the store, we've chatted, briefly.  When we're on the other side, I want to take a few of them out for coffee or dinner, and talk.I'm looking forward - to the end.  And by \"looking forward\" I don't mean, \"in anticipation\", but rather I am imagining what our future might look like based on what I am seeing in the news right now.  It's April.  It's the beginning of growing season for most of us here in the United States. I am seeing way too many reports of vegetables left to rot, of milk being dumped, of farms going under, because they don't have the personnel to harvest, process, or transport the food from farm to customer - many of whom are restaurants that are currently doing only an nth of their usual business.  The food industry is in trouble. It's possible that the media is over-blowing things - like they do - but it's also possible that they are under reporting.  We won't know until we're in that hind-sight.  Next week.  Next month.  Next year. The thing is, it doesn't really matter whether the reports are optimistic or pessimistic, because we have plenty of material to show us what we could/should be doing right now.  We have plenty of examples of times when things got bad and what people did to make them not quite so bad, or failed to do and ended up suffering. We don't have to suffer.  We can be proactive.As a prepper, that's what I preached for over a decade.  Be prepared. That doesn't mean a bunker in the back yard.  It doesn't mean keeping the bug-out bag in the back of your armored SUV and planning to high-tail it to Mt. Katahdin and live off the land.  It doesn't mean buying up 60 acres in the Alaskan wilderness and setting up your off-grid oasis.What it means is taking Teddy Roosevelt's sage advice: \"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.\" And that means, if, like me, you live in the suburbs, you find out what YOU can do, where you are, to make sure that this disaster isn't ... a disaster.The time to start is NOW.Like, RIGHT NOW! Back in the day when I was first starting my prepper journey, I happened upon this list.  It was compiled by folks who survived the Siege of Sarajevo in 1993.  These people lived in the city.  They ended up being surrounded by enemy troops, which limited their movements.  Scrounging for food and basic supplies became the norm, and for most of them, the only hope was to get out alive.Obviously, we aren't at that point of desperation.  At least most of us aren't being shot at from snipers in the next house, but we are at a point where some things are starting to get scarce.  I mean, toilet paper?  Really?This is the toilet paper aisle at my local grocery store.It's looked like this for over a month.In a few months, we may look back and laugh about the run on toilet paper, because it will be funny that we were more worried about wiping our asses than we were about feeding our faces.Of course, there are also shortages in that area, too.  If you've been to the grocery store, you will have noticed that the soup and pasta aisles are particularly bare. I went to the store two weeks before the lock down truly happened here where I live in southern Maine, kind of in the beginning of the panic.  There was no toilet paper.  There hadn't been hand sanitizer in a week or more (which was no big deal, for me, because I never used the stuff). But I was gobsmacked by the barren soup aisle, the empty shelves where the pasta and pasta sauce should have been, and the dearth of flour and yeast.  Since when did those items become so popular? Here we are - a month later, with limits placed on the number of items each person can purchase at a time, and a cap on the number of people who can be in the store at a time, and those aisles are still bare, which actually does surprise me.  I wonder.  I just wonder.  Are people still, really, stockpiling those things? I mean, it's probably not a bad idea, given that come August, we may be experiencing food shortages, like real food shortages, in that, there is no food, because food wasn't grown and harvested and processed.What also surprises me, though, is the well-stocked produce section.  The other day, when the tomato sauce aisle was empty, a few aisles over in the produce section, the store had tomatoes for 25 cents a pound.  I can't even get that price, in season, from my local farmer!  I'm not certain I can even grow tomatoes that cheaply.  I bought as many as I thought they would allow without looking at me like I was a hoarder.I guess what I'm saying is that WE should be reaching further up into the trees for that higher up fruit. We should be buying the fresh produce and preserving it - rather than having stores dump it and farmers compost it. Canning, dehydrating, freezing, fermenting, cold storing - there are a lot of ways to keep fresh food for later.  I mean, what did people do before Campbell's existed to make that Chicken Noodle soup in a can?I alluded to this list a few paragraphs up, and here it is: 100 Items That Disappear First (in an emergency).  I've put an asterisks beside the one's that are already in short supply - in just a month's time.One more note, before the list:  we are a month into this \"emergency\" here in the US.  Some predictions say that we will be open for business by May 1.  Most are saying the social distancing measures could last well into the summer.  Either way, nothing is going to go \"back to normal\" - at least not for a while.  The impacts on the food industry and supply chains will be felt for some time. Most of the hand soap and all of the hand sanitizer was sold out.  The bar soap was mostly gone, too.  Those who usually purchase the organic and/or specialty soaps were in luck, as those more expensive products were still available.100Items to Disappear First1.Generators (Good ones cost dearly. Gas storage, risky. Noisy...targetof thieves; maintenance etc.)2.Water Filters/Purifiers3. Portable Toilets (ALT – 5 galbucket with some saw dust or cat litter)4.Seasoned Firewood.

{"title": "Prepper 101", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2020", "text": "Deus Ex Machina and I watched this film the other night called Prepper (the link is to the trailer on You Tube).  Deus Ex Machina's favorite thing to say when we load a movie to watch that might be of questionable quality is \"How bad can it be?\"Very bad is often the answer.We've turned off more than a few films.And to be honest, Deus Ex Machina wanted to turn this one off, but I needed to watch it. The gist of it is that a high school geography teacher starts to pay attention to what's happening in the world, and what he sees worries him.  He recognizes how fragile our way of life is, and understands that if one of those events (war in the Middle East, contagious virii - which in the movie is Ebola -, resource depletion, climate change, etc.) goes awry, the whole thing could collapse like the proverbial house of cards. Rather than ignore what he sees happening, or get bogged down by fear, he takes action.  He and his wife (also a teacher) start doing things to prepare for the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it (TEOTWAWKI). I love the premise of the movie.  I love that Joe Suburbanite decides to take a proactive approach to what he sees happening in the world.  Rather than marching on Washington holding a sign and complaining about the state of the world, he recognizes that world is going in a bad direction, and he decides to get prepared for when the thing happens.In fact, the movie could have been based on my book Surviving the Apocalypse in the Suburbs: the Thrivalist's Guide to Life Without Oil, because the protagonist in the movie has the same feelings that I have about being prepared rather than scared.  My mantra is:  Don't just survive, Thrive!  And Don't focus on limitations.  Imagine possibilities!The problem I had with the movie was that I felt like their preps were too short-sighted.  The film really only focused on five areas of prepping:  food, water, cooking, self-defense, and shelter. So, while I will not critique the film, I will discuss what they did, and what I think those who are really looking to be prepared should do instead.FOODThere was a lot of emphasis on storing food.  While I don't disagree that one should have six months to a year's worth of stored food, my concern is with so much emphasis on storing prepared foods. What I would recommend instead is that new preppers learn to really see where the food is, which is not just the grocery store.  Instead of buying a bunch of food in cans and boxes, how about figuring out how to grow, raise, and forage food. GrowingThe best start is to purchase seeds, but (at least where I live) seeds are a seasonal commodity, unless one orders the seeds, and ordering seeds, at least for a beginner gardener, can be tricky.  I have spent thousands of dollars on seeds I never used, because the description and picture in the catalog was so appealing.  It's taken me years to figure out what I can grow best, but as the movie depicted, we may not have years to get ready.Instead, what I recommend is purchasing organic produce from the grocery store or a local farmer.  Buy only those things you know you and your family normally eat, and then save the seeds.  Many vegetables have plenty of seeds, and usually those seeds end up in the garbage or compost.  Save them. Some vegetables are the seeds.  Who hasn't had an onion, potato, or garlic clove sprout in the pantry?  Those things can be planted.  I plant sprouted potatoes and for every \"seed\", I end up with between 3 and 5 lbs of potatoes.  Not bad for something I might have discarded.Some vegetables can also be regrown.  Lettuce and celery are good examples of vegetables that can be regrown from scraps. And don't forget sprouts.  Sprouts are, after all, just baby plants.  Buy some sprouts and put them in some soil.  After a few weeks, you'll have a plant.I emphasized organic, because sometimes the inorganic produce has been treated with chemicals to inhibit their growth in storage, or they are GMOs, which are patented, and sometimes bred to be infertile.  So, the seeds won't grow anyway.Dried beans and peas can also be grown into bean plants.  Just soak them, and then plant them ... and wait. I haven't tried regrowing grocery store popcorn, but I have grown popcorn.  The seeds look the same.  Could be worth a try for someone who has nothing to lose, i.e. us Preppers who just need to see what's possible.This video details 14 different produce items that can be regrown.  So, instead of spending a bunch of money on canned food, consider investing in some garden supplies, potting soil, containers, etc. RaisingFor those who have a little extra space and a little more of an adventurous spirit, raising animals for food can be done. We have raised chickens for eggs and for meat.  The only problem with chickens, for my family, is that it is not long-term.  We only have female chickens, and so if the SHTF, we will only have eggs until our chickens get too old to lay, and since we purchase our meat birds as chicks every year, we won't have chicken meat once we run out of what's stored in the freezer.An alternative to chickens are quail, which are perhaps the perfect suburban poultry.  Quail take up very little space.  They are quiet - both the males and the females.  They are easily bred.  The biggest issue with quail is that their eggs are tiny.  One chicken egg is about six quail eggs.  When it comes to quail, one literally has to break a LOT of eggs to make an omelet.Rabbits are one of the best suburban livestock animals.  They don't provide eggs, but they are easy to breed for meat, they are quiet, they don't need a lot of room, and their nutrition requirements would be easier to satisfy in TEOTWAWKI when commercial feed is not available.  Plus, rabbit meat is one of the best, nutritionally. ForagingProbably one of the best solutions to the food issue is to know where to find food that's just out there.  Deus Ex Machina and I have spent a lot of time looking for wild foods.  Our favorite annual wild food is maple syrup.  We have 20 or so buckets with taps, and we get between one and three gallons of maple syrup per year.  Imagine, if we do end up in an end of the world scenario, and suddenly everyone has to give up sugar.  That maple syrup will be wonderful to have. We also forage wild greens, berries, acorns, and feral apples.  We've learned to identify dozens of edible plants (including some mushrooms) within a 5 mile radius of where we live, and we've found many of those plants just growing wild outside our front door.  So, our suburban quarter acre lot has both cultivated annuals and consciously planted perennials, and a variety of wild edibles. Having a bunch of canned foods and staples (like flour, salt, spices, rice, etc.) is not a bad thing, and I don't mean to say that one should not buy those things, but at some point, if the emergency is truly an emergency, those things will run out ... and then, what?  Having the ability to make one's own food by having a garden, raising some livestock, and/or learning to forage will only make one more empowered ... and prepared.WATERThe go-to for water storage in the prepper community seems to always be purchasing bottled water in plastic containers, which is exactly what the teacher and his wife did in the movie.  I do have to give props to the writer, however, for the grocery store clerk, who advised the couple that if they planned long-term storage of the bottled water, they might want to consider also purchasing water purification supplies (in aisle 5), because bottled water doesn't stay safe in the long-term.The grocery store clerk tells them that bacteria in the water will render it unsafe in the long-term.  So, sure, okay. The real issue is that the plastic degrades over time, which leaches the chemicals in the plastic into the water AND over time, as the plastic degrades, the containers, themselves, become unsound.  That is, they will start to leak. The other part of buying bottled water that gets my hackles up, is that MOST of us have perfectly drinkable water at home. I have a friend who lives in Houston, and for those who know anything about US geography, Houston is on the Gulf of Mexico, which means that my friend has survived many hurricanes.  A few years ago, as a hurricane headed toward them, she lamented the fact that her neighbors (that is, other folks who live in Houston - not necessarily those in her neighborhood) bought out all of the bottled water in every store in the city.   Her comment was that they had water in their homes.  She said, rather than buy bottled water, how about buying containers that can be filled with water from the tap?I completely agree with her logic, but I wouldn't, necessarily, purchase a bunch of gallon-sized plastic containers.  Instead, I would have rain barrels.  I actually do have rain barrels, and we use them all summer long to water the gardens and our animals.  Problem is, where I live, rain barrels are seasonal, because the water tends to freeze during our wicked cold winters here in the northeast.As such, we have a couple of different solutions.1.  I often can in small batches, i.e. I might be canning 5 quarts of tomato sauce, which means that I have room in my canner for more jars.  I will fill jars with water and can those along with whatever food I'm preserving.  Glass jars don't degrade like plastic does.  The canning process kills any bacteria that might be in the water.  So, the water in my glass jars will be longer lasting than bottled water from the grocery store.2.  As hikers, we have water filters and in a pinch know how to make a filter out of easily found materials.If I had been the writer of that screenplay, I would have had my characters purchase a water filtration system like this one and a couple of rain barrels, rather than purchasing bottled water. The absolute best solution would be to have our preppers digging a well, but that's not something that most people who live in the suburbs would be able to get away with - even in fiction.COOKING Again, I have to give credit to the writer for thinking about the fact that, if the electricity goes out, most folks won't be able to cook a meal.  Where I live in the northeast, long-term power outages (more than 24 hours) during the winter are frequent enough that we decided not to be dependent on the grid for things like cooking and heating.  We have a woodstove, which allows us to heat our home, cook our food, and heat up water for cleaning.  It's the best investment we've ever made.In the movie, they discuss how they will cook their food, if the power goes out.  At first, they say they'll cook over a fire, but then, nix that idea in favor of a camp stove. Camp stoves use propane, which is non-renewable and not sustainable. There are a lot of options, and I'm sad that they didn't more fully explore them, although I'm sure it was a time constraint kind of thing. I shared how to make a hobo stove, which can be made from materials many folks have lying around - like a popcorn tin or an old coffee can. A home-made grill is another option.  Right after I graduated from college, I found a job, which meant I had to relocate.  Unfortunately, my new employer didn't help with moving costs, and so, while I was able to pay my first month's rent, I didn't have enough saved to turn on the gas for the cook stove and the water heater, and I wouldn't have my first pay check for at least a month.  Cold showers were bad, but spaghetti in a crockpot was the worst.I had no grill, no fire place, no fire pit.  What I had were the shelves inside the oven, a concrete patio, a few bricks, and some charcoal.  Using the bricks, I made a frame to hold the rack from the oven and lit a fire with the charcoal.  Voila!  Instant grill.  Using a cardboard box, I was able to make an oven in which I managed to bake cornbread. Had I been a little more knowledgeable back then, I might have built myself a rocket stove using the bricks, and then, instead of needing charcoal for my fire, I could have used twigs.Since the implication in the film was that the teachers didn't really have any survival skills, they wouldn't have been building hobo stoves or rockets stoves.  If I had been writing the screenplay, I would have had them purchase a Biolite camp stove rather than a propane stove or grill.  The biolite stove uses twigs as fuel, and while it is cooking one's food, it is also generating electricity for charging phones, laptops, and USB headlamps.  Biolite camp stoves and a number of other low-energy cooking options are available in camp stores.  I'm not sure why so many people end up at an Army Surplus store when they're looking for survival gear.  Frankly, I've met some hikers who are a lot more hardcore than many of the folks I served with.  So, there's that.Of course, my little make shift grill worked well and was, essentially, free with the exception of the charcoal, but did you know that you can make your own charcoal?  Yeah, I didn't know that, back in those days.  Charcoal is made from wood. Which is why I would actually encourage new preppers to consider stocking up a small supply of wood.  It could be as simple as saving the branches from pruning one's trees or finding some free pallets, but having some wood is not a bad idea. And I would also encourage the acquisition of a dutch oven.  As the name implies, it can be used as an oven, when placed in hot coals.  The temperature inside the oven gets hot enough to bake bread.  And it's another of those items one might find in a camping store, but not in an Army Surplus store. SELF-DEFENSEAs with most prepper authors, the screenplay author had his protagonists buying guns.  I don't have a problem with owning guns, and when it comes to prepping, I don't have an alternative suggestion for self-defense, but I do have a caution.  If one owns a gun for \"protection\", one must be prepared to shoot a person, and kill that person.  Most people get queasy thinking about killing their own food.  Killing a person, I imagine would be much harder, even if that person was being threatening.SHELTERThe protagonists decide to go in search of a bug out location.  When they fail to find some land that they can afford and that is also useful (i.e. flat and buildable), they start looking at bunkers for their backyard.Ultimately, they realize that what they have is what will have to do.  I agree that our actual goal should be to bug-in rather than bug-out, and that's why I recommend living (and working) in a place where one can imagine surviving long-term, should the SHTF. I also happen to think that the suburbs can be the perfect TEOTWAWKI location, especially if one knows and likes one's neighbors. There were a lot of things that impressed me about the film, and I am not sorry that I encouraged Deus Ex Machina to stick it out with me.  He'll never agree that it was a good film, and that's fine, but a couple of things were actually incredibly thrilling to me.First, the fact that the protagonist was a middle class, high school teacher who lived in the suburbs, and realized that our culture, our way-of-life, is unsustainable, and he started making changes, gives me hope for the world.  I loved the fact that he wasn't a paramilitary commando.  He was actually not a gun buff, and only bought a gun, because some guy at the Army surplus store recommended it.  I also liked the fact that he had some trepidation about sharing that he was prepping - not because he was worried someone would steal his shit, but because he wasn't sure how other people would react, and he didn't want to seem crazy, although he KNEW that IT was going to happen - and soon - and he needed to be proactive to keep himself sane.Second, he doesn't hide himself away. He builds a community.  I read a lot of prepper fiction, and I read this book a while ago about an EMP event.  EMP stands for electromagnetic pulse, and the fear is that if a nuclear warhead is detonated up in the atmosphere, it can destroy anything electronic.  In this book, one of the main characters lives in a suburban home.  His neighbor is a single-professional woman with a high-powered office job.  In a collapse scenario, the main character decides she is useless. I disagree, and feel like the folks in that novel passed up a great opportunity to build a community where they were, rather than embarking on a dangerous, long-distance bug-out venture on riding lawn mowers.The main character in the movie Prepper did not assume that his neighbors, even the ones he didn't really like, had nothing of value to offer to the community to ensure that they could all survive.  I was excited to see, for the first time in Prepper fiction, a story line in which the preppers embraced their non-prepper neighbors and discovered that everyone had something to offer."},
{"title": "Seeds and Junk Mail - Some Things Were Meant to Be Saved", "date": "Tuesday, January 28, 2020", "text": "I've reached that magical age at which I am the recipient of a lot of unwanted mail from organizations that cater to people of a certain age.At the moment, AARP is very interested in my being a member.  I am not as interested in joining as they seem to be to have me.  Every few weeks, I receive another solicitation from them. It's a lot of wasted paper, and we all know how I feel about waste.So, I thought, there must be something I can do to make less waste - other than throwing it in my wood stove.On a related note (it's related ... I swear!) ...We don't buy a lot of fresh vegetables during the winter.  My goal is to grow my own and/or purchase local, in season produce, and preserve it.  There are a lot of vegetables that are eaten from a can (well, a jar) in my house during the winter.  Tomato sauce, pickles, and corn are jarred up and on my pantry shelves.  I also make sauerkraut, and some things are put into the freezer, like broccoli and peppers.Occasionally, however, we purchase some fresh produce, for a specific meal - like steak sandwiches with peppers and onions.And for this treat, I will purchase an organic green pepper from the grocery store.Thing is, those peppers are just full of seeds, and as organic produce, those seeds are likely to be viable. So, I like to save them.  Even if I don't end up using them this spring, knowing that I have them means I won't purchase a packet of seeds.  I've saved $2 from keeping something that might have ended up in the compost pile - not that compost is a bad thing.Back to all that AARP mail ... and you can probably guess where this is going.Good ole AARP includes a return envelope with their mailing.  They want to make as easy as possible for me to join their club.And those lovely little envelopes are just perfect for storing those organic pepper seeds.I particularly like the request in the bottom corner to \"please recycle.\"  Of course, we all know that reusing is much better than \"recycling\", especially these days, when we don't know if our recycling is actually being \"recycled.\"  Do what you can with what you have where you are.  Pepper seeds from organic peppers saved in envelopes from junk mail.  That seems like a good use of time and resources.What did you save today?"},
{"title": "ReUp-ing a Popcorn Tin", "date": "Sunday, January 12, 2020", "text": "The holidays can  be pretty amazing ... and stressful - especially if one is trying to downsize one's collection of stuff.  Getting out of the habit of buying, often just for the sake of giving a gift, can be very difficult.To be honest, I haven't, quite, mastered the skill of giving less or not at all.   There's still that pressure to give *something*, even if it's just some cheap little tchotchske.   None of us want to be guilty of a social faux pas for failing to get a present for someone, even if there is absolutely no reason for that someone to expect a gift.I usually prefer to give homemade gifts or experiences.  Unfortunately, those homemade gifts can be quite time consuming, and too often are not always as well received (depending on the recipient and the gift).  The gift of experience (concert tickets, museum passes, a kayak trip to Fort Gorges, theater tickets, movie tickets) is a great way to keep clutter at bay, while honoring that obligation to give something.  But those experiences can be expensive.  Gift cards have become a favorite way to meet that social requirement, but Deus Ex Machina doesn't like them.  He thinks they're lazy, which maybe they are.  He says one may as well give cash.  I'm not quite sure why giving cash has such a negative stigma.  My sister says that cash makes a great gift, because it's always the right size and the right color.Another gift I both enjoy receiving and giving is consumables - yes, food!  If you're like us, you get a few boxes from mail order places, like Swiss Colony (love that summer sausage and those cute little jars of mustard!).  One of my favorite consumable gifts is that big tin of popcorn.First off, I LOVE popcorn.  I've even eaten it for breakfast and dinner.  In fact, I'm not entirely certain why popcorn has been relegated to a snack food.The only problem with those big tins of popcorn is what to do with the tin when the popcorn is gone.  So, I've come up with six really awesome ideas that I couldn't wait to share for reusing/upcycling those tins.1.  Fill it with more popcorn.From a frugal standpoint, refilling the tin with home-cooked popcorn is the perfect solution.First, we all know that home-cooked food is less expensive than prepared food.  The tin filled with popcorn is between $4 and $10 (depending on where one purchases it, and the flavors of popcorn inside the tin).A pound of non-GMO, organic popcorn, which will fill that tin many times over, is $2.95.Second, most frugal-gurus recommend making menus and cooking ahead.  So, making a tin of popcorn for weekly snacks, makes perfect sense and takes about 15 minutes.  We know that the popcorn will stay fresh in the tin, because, well it was made for storing popcorn, right?2.  Use it for bulk dry goods storage.Pantry moths.  I hate 'em.When I was a first year teacher many years ago, I had a very small food budget.  I lived in a tiny town with no major grocery store.  The bonus (since I only got paid once a month) was that I could run a credit tab at the little general store that was, conveniently, on my way home from work.The problem was that most people didn't buy their weekly groceries at the general store.  They drove the half hour to the next town for groceries, and so the selection at the store was kind of small for actual food, and I'm not entirely sure that the proprietor of the store paid very close attention to expiration dates.One evening, I purchased a box of potato flakes.  When I got it home and poured the flakes into my pot of boiling water, I observed a bunch of little writhing red worms.  I didn't eat the potatoes.  It ended up being a hungry night.What that taught me was how easy it is for the moths to end up in one's pantry.  I mean, who would have imagined that a newly purchased box of potato flakes would have moth larvae in it?  While it wouldn't have saved me from those moths, putting my dried goods into the popcorn tin in my pantry, could prevent the moths from spreading to my other foods, like rice, popcorn kernels, and flour.3.  Turn it into a holder for kindling.4.  Use it as a trash can in the bathroom.My first reuse of these tins was for my bathroom trash.As those who've been there know, those first few months of home-ownership can be pretty hectic, especially with regard to finances.  We all want to have our perfectly furnished home, right off, but few of us have the money to pull it off.  So, those little things that are nice to have, like a trash can in the bathroom, are put on the \"to buy in the future\" list.Deus Ex Machina and I bought our house in December, just before Christmas, and of course, we were gifted a huge tin of popcorn, which worked out perfectly, because we didn't have a lot of extra cash for little incidental purchases (and there was no dollar store in my town at the time), like trashcans.  That little tin was perfect.5.  Boil water or sap (to make syrup) over an open fire outside.I don't know about you, but the clean up after using one of my big kettles on the open fire outside is brutal.  The soot on the outside of the kettle is a mess to clean up.  As such, I don't really like using my kettles outside over the fire, because I will want to use those same pans inside on my glass top stove.The popcorn tin comes to the rescue!  See, I don't have to clean up the outside, because I can just leave it outside until I need it again.6.  Make it into a hobo stove.When I was in the seventh grade, I was a Girl Scout.  My troop went on a camping trip to what someone called a \"primitive camping site.\"  What they meant was that: there was no plumbing, i.e. no showers, no sinks with running water, and no toilets (there was a hand-pump connected to a well for water and an outhouse facility); there were no fancy tents on platforms, and we had to set-up our own canvas tents with no floor (I didn't see anything similar until I went to Basic Training where I was issued a \"shelter half\"); and there were no cooking facilities (there was a fire pit, but no fireplace or grills).Our troop leaders were really amazing, and I learned during that camping trip, that it was possible to make a stove-top burner out of a coffee can.  We cooked on the bottom of the can.  The heat was made by taking a tuna can, filling it with rolled up cardboard, and then pouring melted wax into the can.  The cardboard was the fuel.  The wax kept it from burning up too fast.  We controlled the flame with the lid of the tuna can.It works great for cooking pancakes and bacon.Bonus use:When I posed the question to my family, my daughter said, \"Put your socks in it,\" and, indeed, she is correct.  Those tins are great for a number of storage options, including socks, and they could be painted with chalkboard paint, too, so that we could see what's inside without having to open it.So, next year, when those popcorn tins go on sale, I may have to pick up a few extras.  I'm always looking for free/low cost storage options.And there's popcorn. How would you reuse a popcorn tin?"},
{"title": "Stuff", "date": "Saturday, January 11, 2020", "text": "It's no secret that most of us have too much stuff.  Americans spend, roughly, a quarter of their incomes on consumer goods - clothing; shoes; jewelry; dining room tables, appliances, mattresses, new counter tops, couches; sheets, towels, and table cloths; ice skates, skis, sneakers; lawn mowers, hedge clippers, patio furniture; toys; books; musical instruments; the headphones my daughter is wearing and the cellphone she is holding while I type this.  We spend a lot of time and energy and money accumulating stuff, much of which ends up donated to some organization, like Goodwill, or thrown into a landfill when we can't figure out what to do with it, but just know it can't stay in our homes any longer.  The clutter problem is real for most of us.  Studies have proven that clutter is actually bad for us . Decluttering has become the new catch-phrase and gurus, like Marie Kondo, have gained an almost cult following with their advice on how to cut the crap.  Marie's specific advice is to get rid of anything that doesn't \"spark joy.\"While I agree, mostly, with what she says, what concerns me is that there really is no \"away\", is there?  We throw it in the garbage, and most of us don't have to worry about it anymore, but someone does, right? I live a couple of miles from a former trash incinerator.  The idea is perfect, in my opinion.  The company gets paid to remove folks' trash.  Then, they bring the trash back to their facility, sort out anything that can not be safely burned, and then, burn the rest to create electricity.  Awesome, right?!  Unfortunately, the smell was too much, and the sorting wasn't careful enough to ensure that things like, batteries, weren't being put into the incinerators and causing air pollution.Landfills are also a poor answer to the problem of trash.  Basically a landfill is a big hole.  The garbage - now, just take a second to think of what YOU put in the garbage - is dumped into the hole.  When the hole gets too full, it's topped with soil and grass ... and maybe trees or something, but underneath that lovely \"nature\" facade is your trash. We see lots and lots of stuff about garbage that will take centuries to decompose.  Landfills make the decomposition phase even slower, because the holes are lined with clay to keep contaminates out of groundwater (yay!), but what that means is that some of that stuff could be dug up by your grandchildren's grandchildren, and still be intact. That's a nice image, right?I once had this (somewhat emphatic) discussion with a woman I knew.  I was very proud of myself at the time, because I was very much into recycling.  I didn't buy products with packaging that couldn't be recycled.  Or at least I tried very hard.  If it could be recycled, it went in the recycling.Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Very wrong.  We are all wrong to think that we can just throw our stuff in those blue bins and something wonderful happens.I don't recall exactly what she said, and it took me a few years to understand what she was trying to tell me.  The answer is not recycling, as we are shown in this articleRecycling is okay - as a last resort.  Better is to reuse or repurpose.  So, instead of buying olives in a recyclable plastic container, I should buy olives in a container that I can reuse.  Over the years I've thought about what she said.  Now, when I purchase pre-packaged spaghetti sauce, for instance, I buy the brand that is in jars that can be reused as canning jars (with new lids, but the spaghetti sauce jar lids can be reused for bulk, dry good storage.  So, win-win). Better, of course, is to not use a container at all, but we'll spend some time chatting about that later.My goal has been to reduce my trash AND my recycling.But also to reduce the amount of stuff I just bring into my home in general.  So, instead of automatically running to the store anytime I need something new, I take some time to look around my house to see if I might have something I could make different to satisfy whatever need I have. Which brings us to now.  For the next year, my goal will be to share, at least once a week, something we have repurposed with a how-to of what we did, and what need it filled. Welcome to our journey!  Please feel free to comment and share your stories.   The Story of Stuff shows us that when we're done with that \"stuff\", too often it has no where to go.  It's a great little film, definitely worth the twenty minutes to watch it."}
