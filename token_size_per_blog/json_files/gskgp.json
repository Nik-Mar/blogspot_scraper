{"title": "Festival Look", "date": "Thursday, September 28, 2023", "text": "\"Sir, your hair needs trimming.\" The security staff of our apartment complex remarked. He is unlike the other two security staffs in the sense that he does not feel shy of giving me advice. Usually, the advices are for the vehicles in our garage - their conditions, the washing job I perform occasionally etc. And, those gentle suggestions are always very useful. Therefore, I got alerted. Only a few days back I had to undertake a tour for professional reasons. Did I make a fool of myself with my look? Apparently, both the meetings went well. As such, one is not supposed to judge a book by its cover! For someone who reads a lot, there is a quote to find refuge on every occasion!***                 ***                  *** \"Is it going to be your Puja cut?\" Durga Puja is just a month away.  Here is the specialist who takes care of my hair and unburdens my head at regular intervals. He has been doing it very responsibly for more than a decade now and in a way, has become my legal hair-guardian. According to him, it is his special cut for which my hairs are still eligible for cut and I should not get adventurous to try my luck elsewhere. One is not supposed to disagree with one's barber.He too, gives me lots of advice and shares his knowledge about the contemporary world while doing his job. His presentation is always laced with humour and is always enjoyable. There is one question he will invariably ask me on every visit of mine. Finding me much taller than his usual customers or himself, he would ask, \"How is the weather in upper atmosphere?\" That makes me understand that he is in his usual self and I am in safe hands!This time he got caught on the wrong foot. He was complaining about his own look, which according to him, is a lot better on another day when he shaves his beard. I landed on the wrong day at his place.For someone, there could not be a better opportunity to get equal! ***                 ***                     ***\"Are you not, Goutam-da? Can you recognize me?\" A middle-aged person wearing a cap was standing on the stool and was taking reading of the electric meters of that shop. The shop is just outside the IIT Kharagpur campus. The question came from him. I was then midway of getting relieved of my additional burden on my head. He didn't need to take out the cap. I could recognize him without any issue though our physique have gone big transformation in between. We played together at our young age at the railway settlement side of Kharagpur. Exchange of pleasantries and phone numbers - he sharing how his son did well in study and got selected for a Govt. job, more offers are being expected.There were two electric meters. One commercial meter was for the shop, the other one was for their residence behind the shop. The father of the hair specialist (he adores me a lot) came out and was explained of the expected electric bill and adjustment expected against an earlier payment.Later, both the father and the son were in full praise of this electric meter reading person and his friendly approach. In our discussion in that shop, came the topic of smart meter installations. This will not require foot-falls of a meter reading person! A smart phone, app, preloaded wallet - that's all. Convenient, efficient!In our effort to have everything at our finger-tip for convenience and comfort, are we missing the human touch points in our lives? How to restore that and prevent over consumption of digital contents and resulting infirmity?Let me sign off before I myself sound like giving advice! ***                    ***                       ***Here are a few pictures of Puja shopping ambiance at Golebazar before the market goes frenzy in a few days' time when this month's salary reaches pocket. We were trying to avoid that crowd and my role mostly, was to keep a watch on my motorcycle."},
{"title": "Foundation Day 2023", "date": "Friday, August 18, 2023", "text": "Today is IIT Kharagpur's 73rd Foundation Day. The institute program at Netaji auditorium was to start at 9:30 AM. I was taking my 2-wheeler out from the common garage of our Chitrakoot complex. One of our neighbors was also there for the same purpose. He lovingly referred to my first name, Goutam. Of the three security staffs of our residential complex, two have the same first name. They are from Nepalese / Gorkha background. They are the followers of Goutam Buddha, and the name Goutam is quite common among them.My name was called in the Foundation Day program before but once when I received an award. But, today, my name came up in the lips of three on the Netaji auditorium stage on three different occasions. And that made me remember one big Budhha idol that I visited once. It was situated in a dark cave. If light from a lantern falls on it from one side, one can see that Buddha is smiling, happy. If light falls from the other side, one could see a pensive, sad face. And, if light falls from the front, one can see him in total peace - neither happy, nor sad.We the lesser mortal, swing from a state of fulfilment and unfulfillment, joy and sorrow. Of the three occasions of today, two gave a feeling of accomplishment to see our own students getting success in big stage as entrepreneurs and connecting that to their more than decade old student days' experience here - one curricular, the other extracurricular. The third one reminded of an unfinished work in which we elders are yet to realize the dream of a dreamer who was an inspiration to many.Vidya Bhushan was a UG student of our E & ECE Department. For his final year B.Tech. project, he picked up a challenging problem in neurosignal processing area. Our collaborator from the Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London had a key role in defining the problem statement. He completed his BTP requirement in time (2010) but continued with the work even after leaving the institute. He got a job in Ericsson from the campus placement. In 2012, when he was in IIM Ahmedabad, his BTP work got published in a good journal. The start-up he founded after brief stop-overs at two companies following IIM degree, has now foot prints in 43 cities and was valued Rs. 100 Cr. sometime back, expected to reach 200-250 Cr. mark soon. Today, he referred to that BTP work when awardees were asked to speak a few words after receiving the award from the dignitaries on stage.Imbesat Ahmad was not from our department. National Service Scheme (NSS), IIT Kharagpur was our common chord. I was in-charge of NSS at that time and together with faculty colleagues and young student volunteers (1st and 2nd year UG), took up various projects in neighborhood villages and slums. Imbesat was primarily in teaching activity but played a key role in the bigger team-based activities. Imbesat's current recognition as a young achiever is for his social enterprise that makes education accessible. He started in offline mode in an unreached place and achieved excellence. To scale up, he started online delivery where a doubt is attended within 16 seconds. This enterprise now has 60000 touch points. His podium speech referred to his 1st year NSS teaching experience.Other young alumni achievers too, shared their thoughts which depicted how IIT Kharagpur helped them gain valuable experience in their student days here. Felt proud for each one of them. Congratulations to all awardees!When Dr. P. Arun, Director, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, one of the Guest of Honour of today's function rose to speak, my name was referred for the 3rd time. He recollected how much we two wished to fulfill the dream of a cancer survivor who was inspiration to many. We failed to move beyond a point for reasons beyond our control and felt sad for it. We should make a second attempt and try to bridge the gap. We owe it to that dreamer, Mr. Ananthakrishnan, who is no more with us - the relapsed cancer took the great soul away but his dream remains."},
{"title": "The Maruti 800 Uniq LE", "date": "Sunday, November 20, 2022", "text": "The above pictures were taken today after the weekly Tech. Market visit. It is not far that this companion of us will become part of our memories. This is our Maruti 800 Uniq, Limited Edition which was bought in Nov. 2008. Companionship is of 14 long years where it never put us in any awkward situation. Even today, it is as young as it was when it first joined us, going as strong as it always used to. It can serve next 5 - 6 years easily (after re-registration), if not more, with regular annual maintenance. Thus, there is no reason as such to bid it goodbye, except one in which the new one joining us in place of it, whenever it happens, gives us company for a reasonable length of time, till my retirement from this institute.Rajdoot RD175 was the first motorized 2-wheeler I purchased after getting my first job when I was 22 years old. This was on joining Tata Steel in 1990 after finishing B. Tech. from here. Age was then in my side and drove it quite a lot (unlike this Maruti car which averaged less than 1000 KM per year, of course there were two other 2-wheelers which were usually used for solo travel) in Jamshedpur and then it came with me at Kharagpur when I joined Tata Bearings, a division of Tata Steel. Baba (Father) was not keeping well at that time and then he left us in 1992. I returned to Academics in 1994. From GT Hostel of Kadma, Jamshedpur to small Railway Quarter of Kharagpur (travel to Tata Bearings) and then to two residences at Bhabanipur, Kharagpur (travel to Tata Bearings and then to IIT Kharagpur) - the Rajdoot was in full use. For the brief two years spent in Bandel before joining here as a faculty member in 2002, the Rajdoot went to Bandel and then returned to Kharagpur and became a part of our campus life. The following picture is taken when my daughter was returning from play school in the campus on this bike. In 2006, we felt the need of a new bike that would provide better technology and service. A Honda Shine was bought and the Rajdoot was taken by someone. I felt very sad later when a senior dada (brother) at KVYM told if the bike itself could have been upgraded by some means for use as my father rode it at certain point of time. My father visited Midnapore town, too as a pillion rider. I am sure that the Dada will feel that this 4-wheeler which is running fine should not leave us to make room for a new one. My mother who is no more, used it so many times. Therefore, it is a difficult choice to make. But, we now have entered the window in which the decision is to be taken, may be within a month.One 4-wheeler and two 2-wheelers (currently three 2-wheelers, one is to leave soon) are more than our necessity. Either we retain the old 4-wheeler or let it go to someone where it is of that person's use rather than making it rot for non-use - that overwhelmingly is the decision emerging.Therefore, it is expected to remain with us for one more month or so. The grief of leaving the old one outweighs what is associated with the welcoming of a new one. But, that perhaps is life. The old is to make room for the new ... applies equally well to each of us as an individual!"},
{"title": "Department Visit", "date": "Friday, March 11, 2022", "text": "There was a notice circulated by the Head asking all faculty members of E & ECE department  to be present at the NKN Room at 4:30 PM. Some alumni of this department is to visit us. This is part of the Alumni Meet which had to be rescheduled due to pandemic situation. Since our alumni base is very large, different batches get preference in different years.The NKN Room is at the 2nd floor of front block. Student volunteers were standing at the entrance and at the 1st floor, 2nd floor staircases, waiting to receive the alumni and guide their way to NKN. This 2nd floor is a relatively recent addition for the alumni who completed their study in 1980. An escalator is under construction now and is expected to be operational soon.The student volunteers made us, the faculty members too, feel special. The in-person interactions have just started. While verbal communication has its own place, it is the non-verbal communication, even if it is a smile or a gentle nod, that creates the bond, the human-to-human connect, makes us part of one big family. On entering the NKN Room I was sweetly surprised. The 90 capacity room was filled to the brim except, of course, leaving some chairs vacant for the visiting alumni and Head who would accompany them. The major part of the room was filled by the 2nd year students. The 4th year seniors used this occasion to get them  integrated with the Department. This was first such opportunity for the 2nd years as they were online till now.There will be separate meeting with all 2nd years when all of them arrive in the campus. In alumni meet, emotions run high as they relive in their past, there is time spill-over etc. Thus, we were waiting and it occurred that it would be good to have mutual introduction of 2nd year students and the faculty members. Previous Head, under whose tenure these 2nd year students were supposed to join the Department, took lead and then Prof.-in-Charge, Department Society took over from him.I do take class of these 2nd year students. The offline / hybrid class started the previous day. In fact, ours was the 1st day, 1st class after 2 years of online mode of teaching at IIT Kharagpur. There was an informal meet before with these 2nd year students. That experience and the interaction here showed that all possibly were not bad in this pandemic phase or they staying home taking online classes.After the introduction round, one faculty asked some of the 4th year seniors present there managing the show, why many of their batch-mates are moving away from core electronics to computer science / coding related project or career. Another faculty made them aware of the requirement of large number of skilled Electronics & Communication engineer to make the country self-reliant. It was also asked, according to these final year students, what is needed to buck the trend.And came what many faculty members felt and told, but for one specific reason the same could not be taken up. The senior students told that it is the first year days that are most important in this context when impressions are formed, the opinion about one or the other career path is developed. In the first year, in their formative days, unfortunately, the students are away from departments taking some common courses from departments they do not belong to. The senior students continued. During their own 1st year days which were not online, their seniors used to come to their wings in their hall of residences and give all sorts of funda about career opportunities. And this funda was that a good job is waiting if one learns coding. The young kids coming fresh from their schools would accept anything from their godly seniors which is anything but not the fun of the core of the Department one belongs to. And, it is a vicious cycle. The remedy these senior students suggest is to have reasonable presence of Department subjects from 1st semester itself with some hands-on. Why is it not implementable? It is the department change option that needs to be included in the curriculum where a select few can change their department based on their 1st year performance while 95% of the students cannot. The opportunity to change the Department after 1st year seems to be very attractive. It may be all in perception as regard to what we gain and what we lose by going one way or the other. There might be some objective assessment in future by performing cost - benefit analysis. That might bring changes that these senior students indicate. That might not be too difficult in a curriculum that gives option of Minor, Micro in other Departments as well as Inter-Department dual degree program.These 2nd year students missed those funda sessions as they are arriving now in the campus! This 2nd year, 4th semester is effectively their 1st year, 1st semester. And, they straightway land into the Department subjects. In a way, they wake up to see their core. The freshness, the purity, the receptiveness is evident in their approach and attitude in comparison to earlier batches. Hope, it continues and the department is able to deliver what it is mandated to.  The alumni members started walking in. They spoke briefly. Among them was Professor Susmita Sur-Kolay, who was the first woman President Gold Medal (PGM) winner. She told that there are only six women PGM in whole IIT system till date. There were only 4 girl students in their batch coming through IIT-JEE but she is happy now to see improving gender-ratio in IITs. She said that IIT Education made her foundation strong for which she could learn anything new easily (so important in a fast moving technology space). The following short video gives a glimpse of few other things that she said. The second half of the video has Mr. Kabindra Daga, another alumnus who was introduced as an \"accidental non-Bengali\", where he sings a Bengali Bhatiali song. Head made a short presentation of the Department. Several unique features of the Department, its achievements, its current research focus and future direction were shared. It was highlighted that the Department ranked 92 in the recent QS global ranking, a reasonable improvement over its earlier rank within 100-150 space. Had international faculty and students been not a factor and also, if there was inclusion of undergrad performance for which IITs are better known, the rank would have been much better. The 2nd year, 4th semester freshers listened to these with rapt attention. At the end of the program, there was a walk around the Department corridors.It was 6:30 PM. The faculty member who wanted to know from the the senior students the reason for current trend where many are seen coding-bound and, how to change the direction for greater good, came to my Department office room. We chatted for about one hour before heading for home. Of many different things, the following came in our discussion.It is said that when a baby is born, whoever it sees first, it considers itself to be part of their clan. There is an anecdote where a lion cub raised after birth by a herd of sheep used to act like them and used to flee the place if a lion was around. In that story, one day one lion could catch hold of the cub and forced some remedial measure. But the lion was a lion and the cub was still a cub!"},
{"title": "Fresh Air", "date": "Friday, February 18, 2022", "text": "It was 4:15 PM. I was waiting at the Nalanda entrance, near Subway. An informal meet was arranged where some of the 2nd year UG students of my course were expected to be present. The movement related restrictions got eased. There is no requirement to have passes to leave halls. My 2nd year course is in the list for which hybrid classes have been announced this morning. Effort is on to get the remaining students back to go fully offline in this course.Pandemic showing the sign of turning into endemic, the two year wait is now almost over. The stage is all set to open another dimension for us - for both teacher and students. The on-screen 2D presence is going to have a 3D makeover! The students had online class till 4 PM. The cycles from the nearby halls started hitting the stand.In the online class, voice of a few students are more frequently heard. One of the faceless name from that list started the Teams chat this morning as regard to when and where we meet. As the students started arriving, initially, I tried to find that face for my own comfort by asking \"Are you __?\" One and half month into the course. We were not completely strangers to each other. Neither side was not that nervous, but somewhat hesitant to begin with.The number gradually swelled to 20 - 25. There could be more trickling in. Was there a better option than standing in arc on the road at Nalanda entrance? Thanks to the authority in-charge, we got a place to sit in a classroom of adequate size. Stepping into a classroom with students after two years was an experience by itself, even if it was an informal interaction, a prelude to upcoming hybrid class. What followed next was a purge of fresh air that left each of us oxygenated with elevated SpO2 level!!"},

However, pleasant weather - cloudy sky and gentle breeze, brought many like me out today. It became 11:45 AM to get the jab for sequence number 53. The civic volunteers managing the queue, two young men on two computers, the lady with the log book, two sisters administering vaccine, the lady keeping an watch that none leaves before 30 minute observation period (made a failed attempt to attend a 12 noon meeting) - all were highly efficient and disciplined. The pictures here partially capture the process. The hall where vaccine was administered in this Hijli Rural Hospital (not far from IIT Kharagpur Campus)  looked familiar. Found a picture taken four years back where ICMR-IIT Kharagpur MedTech interns were given an initial brief in the same hall. After that, the interns had a guided tour of this hospital to get acquainted with its activities. This extended to a visit of the interns to far-off villages being served by this hospital together with designated ASHA workers.The IITB senior Prof.  and colleagues were considerate for joining the meeting late and offered valuable post vaccination tips!"},
{"title": "Making of Low Cost Ventilator", "date": "Sunday, April 5, 2020", "text": "Chairman of the Mahindra Group, Anand Mahindra announced on Twitter that its specialised team at its Igatpuri and Mumbai plants have responded to the occasion and developed the first ventilator prototype in under 48 hours. \"Anand Mahindra also tweeted that these medical ventilators developed by the team at Mahindra would cost under Rs 7,500, whereas other dedicated systems cost anywhere between Rs 5-10 lakh.\" This news was published on March 26, 2020. [1]Yesterday's ToI carried an article where Dr Rajeev Chauhan, Assistant Professor at PGIMER said that the device claimed by Mahindra team was originally developed by PGIMER and IISc together from their one year effort and they have applied for 𝒑𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕. With the spread of the pandemic, they began talks with Mahindra group for large scale production. Dr Chauhan further said that representatives from the business house took details of his invention and 48 hours later introduced the ambu bag as their own product. Mahindra spokesperson denied this saying that they had in fact developed their product following 𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒏 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆 designs from a variety of sources. [2]The BBC article, dated 1st April, titled, \"Covid-19: The race to build coronavirus ventilators\" starts with \"The world needs more ventilators – but scaling up production is more complex than it seems. Around the world, thousands of volunteers are working hard to fill the gaps.\" The article continues, \"In terms of their core function, ventilators are not extraordinarily complicated machines. Basically, they are sophisticated pumps ... So why are they so difficult to design? Because it isn’t their function that is difficult. It’s that they have to operate in an extremely reliable way in a high-stakes environment.\" [3]Of various 𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒏 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆 initiatives, the MIT News of March 26 shares an article titled, \"MIT-based team works on rapid deployment of 𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒏 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆, low-cost ventilator\". ln this, \"Clinical and design considerations will be published online; goal is to support rapid scale-up of device production to alleviate hospital shortages.\" The material cost is estimated to be USD 450 (~ Rs. 35000) instead of USD 30000 for standard ones. The article, continues, \"The key to the simple, inexpensive ventilator alternative is a hand-operated plastic pouch called a bag-valve resuscitator, or Ambu bag. A tube is inserted into the patient’s airway, as with a hospital ventilator, but then the pumping of air into the lungs is done by squeezing and releasing the flexible pouch. This is a task for skilled personnel, trained in how to evaluate the patient and adjust the timing and pressure of the pumping accordingly.\" [4]MIT has come up with a dedicated website for this 𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒏 𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆 project and is releasing information as and when it reaches a particular benchmark. The key ventilation specifications to be achieved by this low cost device is non-trivial. It is not just pumping a fixed volume at a fixed rate. Other than spec., hardware and software design details are being populated there (free registration). The download section as of now says, \"𝐖𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐧, 𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫, 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐧-𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐚𝐝𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐞 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐚𝐟𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞.

{"title": "Teacher's Day", "date": "Monday, September 9, 2019", "text": "Was listening to a very senior Professor from Vidyasagar University in a Teacher's Day function few days back at the office of SDO, Kharagpur. He gave example of parents of a five year old seeking advice from a learned on how to raise their kid. The learned said that the parents were five years late as a child learns from the very first day and the conduct of the parents leaves a lasting impression.My father used to tell in my younger days when majority of my extra-academic time used to be spent in Children's wing of an organization, \"Influence of parents on a child is 50%, children's own will is 25% and what you all are trying is 25%. Pick up those children whose parents are supportive to get better outcome.\" Of course, it could not be agreed to as we didn't want to profile kids that way and father was happy about it. His was to caution us for the unique development path taken by each in which parents, the first teachers, play a significant role.Today is father's death anniversary (Link). The teacher in him was there for anybody who crossed path. This evening, there was a lecture from a Ramakrishna order monk here.  His Mother was told by Swami Shradhhananda (initiated by Swami Shivananda, direct disciple of Shri Ramakrishna) to dedicate one of his two sons to Shri Ramakrishna during one of his visit to their California residence; there the father was working as a Microbiologist at UCLA. And, both the sons dedicated themselves with encouragement from parents.Maharaj began with five characteristics of Shri Ramakrisna's teaching: Ever-fresh, Authentic, Allows self-assessment and self-acceptance, Makes best version of oneself, Fun. During Q & A session, he referred to what Nivedita of Ramakrishna-Vivekananda wrote in the forewords of Vivekananda's Complete Works, \"If the many and the One be indeed the same Reality, then it is not all modes of worship alone, but equally all modes of work, all modes of struggle, all modes of creation, which are paths of realization. No distinction, henceforth, between sacred and secular. To labour is to pray. To conquer is to renounce. Life is itself religion.\"To note, Ramakrishna abandoned formal education at his village school when he was twelve as he found that was oriented only towards bread earning. Interestingly, he became the teacher of many a educated in Kolkata that included young college goers. A glimpse of his teaching, as was noted during those years by Sri Mahendranath Gupta, a Presidency scholar and a Professor can be found here (Link). A more recent article by a Stanford scholar, now an Assistant Professor at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University in a Springer journal on unique attributes of Sri Ramakrishna can be found here (Link).Shri Ramakrishna wrote in a piece of paper that Naren would teach and his voice would be heard in home and abroad. Narendra (Naren) remembered, \"But I said to him, 'I won't do any such thing.' Thereupon he said, 'Your very bones will do it.'\" Narendranath came to world stage as Vivekananda. His simple, penetrative, fearless message has something special. It is inspirational. In today's lecture, Maharaj referred to experience of an American lady who met both Czar of Russia and Vivekananda. Both were very big personalities to stand in front. But, there was an important difference and that was significant. The big personality of the Czar made her feel how small she was while the big personality of Vivekananda made herself feel big.        ***                             ***                        ***                            ***On 4th Sept. evening, a panel discussion was arranged here on the topic \"Artificial Intelligence and its Impact on the Society.\" An observation there seemed to suggest that educational institutions and teachers would not be required in time to come. Educational material will be delivered to students by AI, digital technology. Knowledge in the book will be better accessed through digital platform. Information required by a student will be only key-stroke away or will be available in the recommendation panel.The writing on the board as I stepped into next morning's 8:00 AM class, \"Happy Teacher's Day\", brought smiles on either side. Dr. Radhakrishnan's, the birthday boy's thought-provoking quotes appeared as last year's FB post. Greetings, messages. Then came these words from a 2018 batch IAS, IIT Bombay BTech in the Teacher's Day function at SDO Office, \"Great teachers teach from the heart and not from the book. Teaching really makes a difference.\"\"If you want to know India, study Vivekananda,\" Tagore said. If you want to know about education, there is also Vivekananda for you. \"What is education? Is it book learning? No. ... Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested all your life. ... The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle for life, which does not bring out strength of character, a spirit of philanthropy, and the courage of a lion - is it worth the name? Real education is that which enables one to stand on one's own legs. The education that you are receiving now in schools and colleges is only making you a race of dyspeptics, you are working like machines merely, and living a jelly-fish existence. ... We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.\"AI, digital technology seem to bring back education to its roots by revisiting the teacher-taught relationship and educational institutions getting the opportunity to grow up and beyond!!"},
{"title": "Social media", "date": "Tuesday, June 25, 2019", "text": "Yesterday forenoon, I was in an invigilation duty in the Department together with some young faculty members. This gave an opportunity to know how they are doing and share whatever little I have learnt over time on career milestones. At that time, a recent recruit who hails from opposite side of the country told something that surprised me. He told that before joining this institute he went through my blog and my responses in certain places in social media. These gave him another feel of the institute and helped him taking the decision.I felt somewhat apologetic that my blog posts here have become quite irregular as the traffic got diverted to facebook! The day before yesterday evening, I was dropping my daughter at a private tuition. There, had a chance meet with another faculty, few years junior and from another department. His better half was also there who in a thankful note told that my facebook post on the movie ‘Kanttho’ (Voice), posted the previous day, was very useful. That review motivated the otherwise reluctant colleague accompany her in the Sunday matinee.While one may tend to classify above two as 'Thumbs Up' examples which the emoticon or comment of those posts do not reveal, it is also possible that there could be 'Thumbs Down' classification too which does not reach the author. For example, if 400 views a post, about 10% i.e. 40 may actually chose to register their feedback and that too may depend on certain extraneous factors than actual content of the post. Some of the social media space is designed in such a way that only 'Thumbs Up' is registered to hype up the sentiment and no statistics is provided how many actually hit that page and chose not to take a call. Such a space may even allow manipulation with no proper mechanism to respond when a complaint is lodged.Social media gives a platform to express oneself. It connects to many who we as author may not be acquainted with. We do not exactly know the influence-trajectory of such a post - how it modulates affective states of different individuals. Hence, as a responsible person we need to ask ourselves certain pertinent questions. What is there in the back of our mind when we make a post? Is it to stimulate a positive, constructive chain of thoughts? Is it just for fun to bring smile to someone? Is it to tickle the intellect? Is it to vent out frustration and get a sense of relief? Is it to just engage in a conversation when feeling lonely? Is it to form public opinion about something that matter?   Is it for wider circulation of an important piece of information for greater good? Or, is there some specific motive, implicit or explicit, for which the post may be considered deplorable?What is easier to withdraw – something that is spoken to a few or something that is written in a public platform? What is easier to do – to say ‘I stand corrected.’ to those who correct me or to acknowledge the same in full public glare? The greater difficulty to admit a mistake in writing, that too in a public forum, may keep one going on and on by bringing ill-logic, fuzzing / shifting the context, shout outs. We cannot help doing so as the social media makes a public figure of me in certain sense and I am unable to consider anything as an option for which my carefully curated image can take a beating.Therefore, an otherwise soft-spoken person, amenable to logic in a private, one-to-one discussion may behave quite differently in social media because of certain psychological vulnerability. This includes a sense of self-righteousness lurking at the back of our rational self and the posturing made in public domain. We think that bucks stop elsewhere than me. Everything else should change but not me. I deserve a better deal which I do not get due to other's fault. I know more about other's woe than that very person. All the while I am in a denial mode if clueless about what bugs myself. Like every other powerful things, a good use of social media can initiate a virtuous cycle while a misuse can take us to nadir by cascading effect associated with a vicious cycle. Social media is a great place to be in if used responsibly else, it may curb individual development, individual's ascendancy in human scale. In this regard, it is important to note what Vivekananda said, life is a continuous struggle to move from one's lower self to higher self. P.S.1: My elder sister complained some days back that many of my posts are not fully comprehensible. I am sorry if this post is turning out to be one such. As is said, \"Dane dane pe likha hai khanewala ka nam (every piece of grain is destined to be consumed by a particular individual)\", may be each post has a target audience to whom it reveals in full and for the rest, only partially!!!P.S. 2: It is to be noted that visa applicants to the United States are required to submit any information about social media accounts they have used in the past five years under a State Department policy that started a month back, on May 31, 2019 (Link). Such measures and other deterrants may force us to be more responsible in social media and make us behave more sensibly.Added on 26-06-2019While I was writing the above post yesterday night on way to complete a struggling half-century at 00:00 Hrs. (there were hits and misses but no throwing away of wicket), the youngsters in the lab. were coming up with this Yaadein album to surprise me today. And, they picked up each of these photos from social media. Needless to say, I am surprised!! :-)The seniors preferred to be traditional!At home, the person-in-command made the payas while a seventy nine year old and her grand daughter took turn to feed initial few spoon-fulls!!"},
{"title": "Not Aware Of", "date": "Sunday, June 9, 2019", "text": "In today evening's study circle, Shri Ramakrishna's \"খপর নাই  (Not aware of)\" came again and again. This was in reference to unexplored wealth / faculties within us. Those being not cultivated, we feel ourselves weak, miserable, unfit in front of challenges.The topic was \"Life Building.\" Excerpt from a small booklet written by Sri Nabaniharn Mukhopadhyaya was read out (Link).  It talked about three basic elements within - Body, Mind, Atman. Vivekananda made it easier to understand with 3H - Hand, Head, Heart. Each of these requires balanced food and exercise for its development.Then the house was open for discussion. The first question was if the idea of development of 3H would resonate with someone who is fighting hard for survival. The answer was, the more the struggle, the more is the need to equip oneself the best way possible.We have example of people applying Head to make intelligent use of time in difficult times, Heart coming into play to remain united and fight together. And of course, Hand symbolizes physical labour, hard work and that has no substitute.Someone referred to one of the prayer song with which the study circle started... বিদ্যার সুফল প্রকাশ করে উভয়কে সমভাবে পালন কর (Let the education yield good result to take equal care of us). Therefore, there is a constructive role to play to make each one of us stand on one's own feet.Our upbringing, narrowing of exposure which results in narrowing of vision and de-growth of certain important faculties make us vulnerable. This gets exposed when we cannot avoid facing hard realities of the real-world. Each of us has our own challenges. Individual development trajectories may take divergent view of same challenge - if it is extreme or if it is just another one that comes and goes.Narrowing of exposure in our formative years is very much related to improper nutrition and lack of exercise. We do not feel like playing team game in the open field where you lose one day but win another day. We think that reading of biographies of great people and the struggle they went through is a wastage of time. Any effort to know our relation with the society draws askance. Anything unselfish is for someone else to act upon. Then came the discussion on Atman, our deeper self, for which Vivekananda refers to Heart that feels. Part of the poem, \"Quest for God\" written by Vivekananda (Link) was read out. This was part of the letter written exactly one week before his famous Chicago Address of 11th September, 1893. The letter was to Prof. John Henry Wright, the Harvard University Professor who introduced Vivekananda to Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda was not aware of the need to carry something with him from India as a credential to represent Hinduism.Vivekananda writes ~ O'ver hill and dale and mountain range, / In temple, church, and mosque, / In Vedas, Bible, Al Koran / I had searched for Thee in vain. / Like a child in the wildest forest lost / I have cried and cried alone, / \"Where art Thou gone, my God, my love? / The echo answered, \"gone.\" Vivekananda continues ~ Thou speakest in the mother's lay / Thou shuts the babies eye, / When innocent children laugh and play, / I see Thee standing by. / When holy friendship shakes the hand, / He stands between them too; / He pours the nectar in mother's kiss / And the baby's sweet \"mama\". / Thou wert my God with prophets old, / All creeds do come from Thee, / The Vedas, Bible, and Koran bold / Sing Thee in Harmony.P.S.1: Yesterday, read a survey based article on mental health of students in premier higher education institutes of the country. Read the proposed solutions. In today's study-circle, it came in the thought when Shri Ramakrishna's  \"খপর নাই  (Not aware of)\" was referred to.P.S.2 There is certain acknowledgement (Link) in the shift to consider EQ (Emotional Quotient) over IQ (Intelligence Quotient) in workplace: for choosing leader, engaging team, training, making one move out of one's comfort zone etc., even if the aim is to maximize the organizational output. EQ here is categorized as: Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy and Social Skills.P.S. 2a: To note, character qualities cannot be manufactured in a certificate program or a motivational speech event. Behavioural makeover falls off when one is put to test outside (air)conditioned environment. To assimilate character qualities, one needs to go through a life building process by taking up appropriate nourishment and exercise on a regular basis that develops 3H. It needs conscious and sustained effort as anything contrary would undo what is incrementally gained. There is no short cut.P.S.3: If this post appears too heavy, then here is a video made this morning. For this, HH finds a talent in me which I do not seem to be aware of. She advises me to take up film direction after retirement!"},
{"title": "Land of Opportunity", "date": "Wednesday, December 5, 2018", "text": "A village boy comes from a district which is 6 hours from Kolkata towards North. His father had a small business of selling mosquito net, but also a dream of making the youngest son an engineer.Village school education was free but could not help the boy securing good enough a rank for Govt. Engineering colleges. An education loan helped to get an admission in a private engineering college in the neighbouring district for which a village school teacher stood guarantor.There was a campus job offer of Rs. 12000 p.m. but while joining the boy found the company to be a fake one. Off-campus attempt to get a job asked for a Rs. 25000 deposit to a company. The job was found to be one where he had to climb tall cell phone towers in hills without safety gear. Mother asked him to leave the job and come back home.Some neighbours and members of larger family members laughed at this fate of the engineer. He started helping father in the mosquito net business. Some gave suggestion to work as labour and learn masonry.-----The phone call came yesterday evening when I was returning from Kolkata after an official work. There were best presentation award in conference, publication in very good journal before (more in the pipeline). Now comes a 'signal processing' work related job offer from campus placement in one of the most reputed company of the world. This is an international brand that offers only premium products which are aspiration of who's who.Wish the father was there today to see what his engineer son is up to. During his project and M.S. work here, the son was devastated to hear but then did his best to take the father to the best place in the country offering cancer treatment.----It is time for search engines to redefine \"Land of opportunity\"! The boy once shared that every evening after returning to hostel from lab. he takes time out to talk to himself - to analyze the problems in hand and find ways to overcome them. And, he finds this poster inspiring! The successful run of biopics at Bollywood in recent times may evoke interest in this script!!!"},
{"title": "Bharat - Ek Prem Gatha", "date": "Tuesday, October 2, 2018", "text": "The train finally moved at 4:15 AM, 6:30 hrs. later than the scheduled time. Announcements of incremental delays due to 'operational reasons' came infrequently. It was left to guess what were those 'operational reasons' as each answer from the persons who mattered added to the confusion. It was a long wait with 2 unwell members for a family of 3 and, many others. As we boarded, we lost no time to hit the bed. We had 3 sleepers in one side of a block of 8. Woke up little later when 4 co-passengers of that block boarded the train. One berth went vacant. An elderly lady was in charge of that family of 4 and was instructing what the rest 3 would do. Her son, appeared to be an off-duty, young army man, was following the orders and meticulously made bed for all four. The elderly lady and her husband had the side berths. The son and the bahu had two berths in the middle. The lady's loud voice and the son's mild reply in affirmative slowly, slowly started fading ... The morning came late. We had to get down at 10:00 AM. These co-passengers were making a longer journey. The elderly lady ordered the son to arrange tea. The vendor served dip-tea. The bahu in ghunghat was unaware of how to handle dip-tea setup. The son helped her under a watchful pair of eyes from the side berth. The elderly lady suggested something as snacks for all. The bahu didn't seem to utter any word but the son understood. More options available in the pantry car which was only two coaches' away. A radiant glow and she started walking towards the pantry car barefoot. The son got an error message and stopped her. The sandals were far underneath the lower berth. The son struggled to take them out and then she moved on. The son was tying lace of his shoes when the elderly lady murmured, \"Baap par gayi (went by her father)!\" to which came the mild reply but this time in negative, \"Itni chhoti na soch, Ma (Don't think it that low, Mother).\"The son and bahu were away. The elderly lady spoke a few things to her husband who quietly listened. Then the lady went to give her back some rest and started watching the nature through train window. The elderly man got down from his seat and set two pillows to her back and made room so that she could stretch her legs and relax. The son and bahu came back soon with snacks of individual choices and all of them started having it. It was time for us to deboard. The accent in which the family spoke made me remember the movie with dialogues such as, \"Gold toh gold hota hai ... chhora lave ya chhori.\" Didn't know why but felt there was a plot in this story that was begging for unmaking through a larger plot of \"Bharat - Ek Prem Gatha.\" Category: Semi-fiction, Embedded-reality"},
{"title": "At the other side", "date": "Tuesday, September 25, 2018", "text": "Human makes mistake. I am human, therefore! This week, after watching the movie \"Uma\", work of an award winning Director, I made the mistake of telling a group of three persons that everything is excellent about the movie except that without Mahishaurmardini (Mahalaya) pieces in the background / foreground one would always fall short of recreating Durga Puja; Anjan Dutta in his character role could have been less loud and there were too-muchness  in the  use of the dialogue. \"I want  to make a master-piece.\" Last week after watching Boom-Boom \"Satyameba Jayate\", I didn't say anything to anybody, even to myself. Earlier, after watching \"Dhadak\", while leaving the hall, I just murmured if that was the only way to end the movie which invoked an angry retort from a fellow spectator, \"Why not if that is what our society is.\"The Karma caught up with me soon. I was asked to shoot a 3 minute long promotional video for an upcoming 3 month long program. For this, I had to fit myself into many different roles, that of script-writer, background designer, dress designer, make up man, director and also, actor. And there was only 24 hours of time for all these with no relief from usual office and household work. I started with a visit to the studio. The camera crew showed how it would be done and examples of few such promotional videos which were shot before. Most importantly, they provided lots of encouragement and told me that I need not be nervous. A slot of 2-3 PM was given next day i.e. today.I started writing a 3-minute script and came up with a one pager. People who I sought feedback from uttered the minimum but a look of disagreement said what they wanted to say, that I could have done much better. After one iteration it appeared to me as okayish. It was late evening, too late to get a feedback on that. Then, started working on the background design which was completed late night.The director in me told that there must be lots of energy, enthusiasm, cheerfulness in the delivery with a matching get up. The actor in me, facing the camera first time for such a promotional shoot, had everything in contrast in him. The shirt has to be single coloured, preferably dark. The trouser could be anything as the shot would be above the waist. Found that the dark, single coloured shirts in the stock need to be ironed. The earliest I could get it done from outside was this evening. Who does not know that self-help is the best help? There was a visit to barber's shop. He was surprised as it was ahead of the schedule. Little touch up after which he reminded that I need to pay another visit before Durga Puja.It was 1:15 PM to return home after conducting midterm project viva. There were 30 minutes for a rehearsal. Got a quiet room and started reading the script loud. My own voice appeared strange to me. Got accustomed to after reading it few times. Daughter got drawn from next room with a camera in hand and there were funny takes.Reached the studio at 2 PM sharp. The camera crew told that reading out from script was not allowed. This was known to the director in me but the actor in me was praying for the opposite. \"Can there be a prompter, a screen in front wherefrom I can read it out?\" The crew looked at me meaningfully. They understood that they had a difficult job ahead of them. And the answer to the question was negative.Some effort with the chroma software and background fixing, combing of hair for which mobile phone camera in selfie mode came handy, and we were good to go at 2:30 PM. The studio was to be released for other work at 3:00 PM. Take 1 survived 30 seconds. Take 2 about a minute. Fumbling after going good for 2 minutes in Take 3. For Take 4, camera crew asked not to start all over again but from where I stopped in Take 3. They concluded by that time that I was not in a position to finish a 3 minute's script at one go.It was 2:55 PM. The persons who would take over the studio at 3 PM was at the door. One crew asked me to go for another full take as they wanted to make some change in proportion of my image and that of the background. I began all over again and behold, the whole 3 minutes' shot was okay at one go in this Take 5. The crew were very happy for their accomplishment. I was in a state of disbelief, \"Did I do it?\" The next slot persons watched this take in the monitor. They entered when I was packing up and congratulated. Endnote: It was a lesson learnt. Never ever critcize a script-writer, director, actor, etc. Who knows whether the persons from that make-believe world can make that famous \"Om Shanti Om\" dialogue (Kehte hain ki, ... agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaaho to puri kayanat usey tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai) work in the reverse direction, too?  :-)"},
{"title": "Not in Syllabus", "date": "Saturday, July 28, 2018", "text": "PART II was sitting at the back among freshly inducted students in the 'unreserved' seats of Netaji Auditorium. Tried but could not ignore when a hand waved at me from the first row. Got introduced to Samarth and Ashay with once held NSS (National Service Scheme) identity of mine. Samarth asked if I could recognize him. He was from Mechanical Engg. dept., graduated in 2014 and was an NSS volunteer. Ashay was shyer of the two. We two managed a gentle nod. The stage was up for the screening of 'UNRESERVED', an award winning documentary, directed by Samarth and produced by Ashay.The occasion was freshers' induction program. On 23rd July, the UG 1st year joined the institute and a week long induction program was arranged for them to get acclimatised to the environment; before the rigour of the academic work starts. Samarth and Ashay got introduced to the audience. Both spoke briefly in the beginning and the interactive session was reserved after the screening of the film.The one hour documentary has eleven segments interwoven in such a manner that one would remain riveted to it. The segments were picked up from their 17 day long train journey in unreserved compartments throughout India. The Rs. 1 Lakh budget asked for a minimalist approach -  only a DSLR camera and a microphone to shoot. No retake, no rehearsal - documentary it is, yet it has the ingredients of many full length feature films - the ones that make you smile, that make you cry, that make you think. The film shows things as they are and never sounds preachy. At the same time, the characters in the unreserved compartments appear more qualified than many a experts who occupy prime time television space to speak on important issues faced by the country. One would vouch that the  greatest of the actors cannot match their expressions whatever be the number of takes because it was effortless real. Needless to say, the audience was deeply moved by the movie and a standing ovation was more than due at the end of the screening (Link).I shall refrain from sharing the actual content of the movie rather, would urge everybody to spare one hour to watch the movie, available for free in youtube (Link). Assured that it would be a revelation of a different kind and our love for the country and its people would make a quantum leap after seeing the movie. It is not sympathy but empathy which will overpower us, we shall cry when they cry and we shall laugh when they laugh. We shall feel a kind of oneness and an urge to be by their side and gently ask, \"How do you feel now?\" Of all the questions that were asked at the end by the freshers, there was one which could be there with many of us. While Samarth worked in an MNC for six months after graduation from Mechanical Engg. Dept. before making the plunge, Ashay moved into film-making immediately after graduation from Industrial & Systems Engineering. The question asked was why they did the Engg. if they were to go into film-making. And, Samarth answered smilingly, \"Engineering is the new plus two (i.e. Higher Secondary) of current times.\" Both of them went through a discovery phase during their engineering days here. Both were into short-film making which was a part of their extra-curricular activities and were competing for Hall Championship (they were from different Halls) which helped them identify what they were up to.They told that film making has three different elements in it - script, camera, editing. One may not be good in all and thus, needs to team up. They are ready to help current students in any of their projects. They particularly mentioned of the opportunities lying ahead for NSS volunteers among them who would be working among underprivileged in adjoining villages and slums. Presented below are two videos from NSS Camp 2016 (students speaking) and 2017 (faculty members speaking).PART IIThere was an interactive session arranged in the Dept. for UG freshers and their guardians on 23rd July evening. With 100+ students joining, there was not a big enough room in the Dept. to address all of them together and we had two separate sessions - one with the students and one with the guardians. The students were in a very happy mood to join a premier dept. of a premier institute. While few, only a few, seemed little nervous, the rest appeared very confident while introducing themselves. Next, we interacted with the guardians who understandably, was anxious to get separated from their wards. We assured them and also made them aware of issues in general faced by the students and how the guardians can keep a tab if there is any slippage and also, how we all can work together - that stepping into an IIT for them is an important step but it is only a step (a 2012 Freshers' Intro. Link). Some of the guardians said if we shared the same with the students in the earlier session. Did we? :-)The last two Sunday study circles had members uttering the words \"Not in Syllabus\" in the context of what we need to be taught in our formative years. We leave certain important learning outcomes to learning by default and wonder if we fall short when those outcomes matter. Yes, those are \"Not in Syllabus.\"Few days back, I was listening to an interactive session of Swami Sarvapriyananda of Ramakrishna order with young students of Shilpamandir, Belur, a Polytechnic college. It was partly in English and partly in Bengali. The discussion was on the topic, \"Personal habits for higher work efficiency.\" Presented below a summary of this discourse in which he is asking all students to understand the significance of five key points to make the best of their student days. Incidentally, Swami Sarvapriyananda got his Business Management degree from XIMB (Bhubaneswar) and delivered series of lecture before IIT Kanpur students and many places abroad. His TEDx talk can be found here (Link).Point 1: Have self-confidence.And he quotes Vivekananda. “He is an atheist who does not believe in himself. The old religions said that he was an atheist who did not believe in God. The new religion says that he is an atheist who does not believe in himself.” No matter how talented one is, lack of confidence in oneself would put one's foot in the brake pedal and would not let one accelerate or move forward. The one having self-confidence does not feel shy of trying and thus, has higher probability to succeed. We need to remember, if another person could do, with effort I can do the same and can even surpass.Point 2: Have a high goal in life.It helps in channelising one's energy in a particular direction which helps in achieving excellence. There is no place for mediocrity if one wishes to reach the pinnacle of success. In any journey we undertake, when we board a vehicle, we do tell the driver where we want to go. Where would we like to go in our life's journey? Not having a purpose - random frittering would lead to a void and frustration would engulf us in time to come.Point 3: Learn concentration.Swami Vivekananda said that the difference between an ordinary person and an extraordinary person lies in the degree of concentration. Practise of concentration goes through three phases - focusing on something, cutting out rest of the world, holding that focus. He gives an example from the life of his brother disciple Swami Ramananda (IIT JEE All India Rank 2, CGPA near 10 when graduated, now a faculty member of Ramakrishna Vivekananda University, Link) where after study hours, drum playing started but Swami was so engrossed in study that he did not recognize it. Somebody tried to converse, gently pulled his feet but he had no sense of it. Only when someone pulled the book, he got startled and started making a meaning of the surroundings. Yes, the concentration can be so deep!Point 4: Learn time-management.Greatest resource of life is time and each is bestowed with same amount of this important resource, while other resources may differ. How we utilize 24 hours of a day in life makes the difference. One can divide what we take up in four categories: (i)Urgent and important, (ii)Urgent but not important, (iii)Not urgent but important, (iv)not urgent and not important. Many things that are important for our life do not get the priority (urgency) it deserves (Category (iii)) and we keep it postponing. We find ourselves looping between (ii) and (iv) only to find it is too late 10-20 years down the life. Swami visited two institutes with almost similar infrastructure. One of them was rated much higher. In it, students were using the lab., library etc. while they were empty in the other institute.Point 5: Be unselfish.This is the secret of success which often illudes us. Selfishness comes from poverty mentality. Unselfishness comes from prosperity mentality. We human or so rich - we have time, energy, knowledge, intellect, money - if we give, what we get back in return is many times more. It may take time to understand this - the earlier one understands this, the luckier is the person. Swamy gives an example from a US university. A Psychology Professor one day didn't take the class and spent his earning to take the students to a popular movie. The students were very happy. Week later, he again called off the class but this time took the students to a slum where they gave various toys, gifts to underprivileged children. The students enjoyed that visit and was happy, too. Both occasions, students gave a rating of 3 to 5 in a scale of 1 to 5 on how happy / satisfied they were. Six months down the line, when these students were asked to recollect these two visits and how happy they felt now, in the former the rating came down to 1-2 while the later maintained the same 3-5 level. To be effective, one needs to work with others and cannot afford to be self-centred. Unselfish people are more effective, successful and happier.The video of Swami Sarvapriyananda talking to students follows. The sticker in this Part II showing the difference between successful and unsuccessful people was sent yesterday by a friend who graduated from here with us. After completing B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engg., he did his Masters in a reputed US University, provided consultancy to many Fortune 500 companies etc.. But, wait! There comes something which was not in syllabus!! His current interests lie in bringing out the original spirit of ancient Sanskrit wisdom to modern times."},
{"title": "Over a cup of coffee ", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2018", "text": "[Adapted from this FB post. Prelude of it can be found here / here / here. ]The speaker of this TED talk [Youtube Link] (nearly 0.5M views in 3.5 months since publication), Scott Galloway is a 'Clinical' Professor of Marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business [Linkedin profile]. Yesterday afternoon, had an opportunity of a 90 minute adda at Tikka over a cup of coffee with one of our alumnus who did his MBA in the same business school. Currently, he is working on investment in start-ups and helping M & A with big corporations.Such interaction is very educative for us who work with students and their aspirations. It was learnt that 10 percent of the start-ups are definitely promising. Many start-ups do oversell, are risk-averse while there are those who are quite confident. And, larger fraction of these start-ups are in Artificial Intelligence (AI) targeting the Digital Marketing space.This made me reflect upon the recent controversy about Cambridge Analytica's misuse of social media platform in grand scale [The Guardian follow up]. Could it be that tighter rules and regulations are in the offing on data ownership, protection? While it is being believed that the 'data is new oil' of the economy, there is increasing awareness and concern on misuse of data and its unintended exploitation.Going forward, sharing of data across platforms may not be found as easy. Informed consent may mean much more than clicking \"I Agree\" button where the person concerned as per his background will actually be able to make out what he gives consent to and what are it's consequences. He can pick and choose and not forced to agree en-block, without the sword of denial of service (the basic service which is essential today and is to be considered undeniable) hanging on his neck. It should be explicit if the person himself (his digital self) is going to end up being a saleable product, if so, how he exercises his right to know who holds his digital persona at a given time and for what purpose (since he is more than a poultry animal, nurtured with what it thinks as free stuffs, to get eventually sold).The hard hitting TED talk of Prof. Galloway follows a Q & A session where he says, \"They (Corporations) are not concerned about conditions of our souls. They are not going to take care of me when I get older. We have set up a society that value shareholder's value over everything and they are doing what they are supposed to be doing.\"Zeynep Tufekci's TED talk [Youtube Link] was published just one month before Galloway's, on 11-11-2017. Zeynep, associated with University of North Carolina and Harvard, does research on social implications of emerging technologies in the context of politics and corporate responsibility. Her talk is very incisive on how things work out in digital space and what is its implication for which she gives specific examples.One of her finding shows that in this AI driven world, a bipolar, manic person may be found the most gullible by the algorithm to buy a ticket to Las Vegas since such people overspend, and then he is pushed such content that makes him go for the purchase. Her own study of a particular rally showed youtube's AI algorithm pushing more of white surpremacist's video in increasing order of extremism through suggestions. She also talked about an experiment where 67 M people were shown two different content through pop-up, the second one was more persuasive than the first to perform a task; and much larger share of the people of the second group did really fell for the task.She finds that whatever be the intention of the seemingly good people writing these AI algorithms, the persuasive architecture of the algorithm eventually finds out that if it shows something enticing, hardcore, something that can affect emotion and behaviour, then people will give more attention and they can be persuaded to do what the algorithm aims at. Therefore, the associated liability cannot be just transferred to the algorithm, however deep and opaque it might be, where people behind it claim innocence.The last TED talk of this post [Youtube Link], dated July, 2017, is that of Tristan Harris [Website]. He is said to be the “closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience.” He suggests that we must embrace following three as solution and at the earliest. (i)We need to acknowledge that we can be persuaded (our ego may find it difficult to acknowledge), (ii) We need new model and accountability system (transparency in the flow) and (iii) We need a design renaissance that would aim at (a)protecting us and (b)empowering us.In our yesterday afternoon's Tikka adda, our human intelligence (whatever is left) told that besides artificial intelligence, issues related to genetic engineering need our immediate attention!!Note: The above is as understood by me in a finite time and, misunderstandings, if any, cannot be attributed to other persons appearing in this post."},
{"title": "Way back", "date": "Tuesday, September 5, 2017", "text": "This day, ten years back, came up with the first post of this blog. Our alumnus, Vinayak who founded http://parivaar.org/ was visiting IIT Kharagpur campus on September 05, 2007. Chiranjeev Maharaj was accompanying him. And we had an interesting session with the visiting team. I don't remember today what exactly was the trigger to start the blog and write a short post on that visit.  There was a follow up visit on March 08, 2008 for which there was an elaborate post.1, 26, 51, 56, 27, 22, 28, 20, 4, 3 are the number of blog posts from 2007 to 2016 in consecutive years. This year, it is 4 so far. If twenties are considered baseline, there were heightened activities in 2009 and 2010 and, major fall since 2015. In 2011, started NSS blog and there were 21 posts. Together, it comes near to 50 mark of earlier 2 years. Started NSO H&F blog in 2013 which had 53 posts that year. There were other purpose driven blogs started after that but with less number of postings. Of course, one opens up differently in different spaces as per what defines that space. All those blogs except few, have been handed over to successors. The all time maximum page view crown goes to 2013 Teacher's Day post of this blog. It gave a glimpse of the day in words and pictures. The emphasis was on 'Shraddhaban labhate Jnanam'  - one who respects, learns. A learner finds something to learn from everybody, even non-living things like sky, wind, mountain, ocean ... I was enrolled into facebook in 2008. However, there was not much activity there. Avoided accepting friend request from people not directly known and also from students. For students, the thought had been, till I was in a position to give grade to a student, it is to be postponed. Then something serious happened and it appeared that there needed a better, direct channel of communication - the designated portfolios failing. Facebook became the preferred mode.May be some anniversary post in facebook will figure out someday that there is a big fall in facebook posts, too in recent times. By default, the reason may be ascribed to poor SNR (signal to noise ratio) or too-much-ness there which in some sense may be correct!!This special day had its share of emails, phone calls, SMS, visit to office by students, small function at lab. etc. The TIFAC interns working on 'Legal and Ethical Issues related to Artificial Intelligence' came with a small flower-stand and flowers made by them . They themselves placed it in front of the Vivekananda portrait (drawn by an ex-student) that they noticed in earlier visit to my office. Bow to all teachers and teacher of teachers!"},
{"title": "Inner cry", "date": "Tuesday, August 22, 2017", "text": "Statutory warning :-)  It is a rather long post with lots of quotations; may not be fit for reading at one go!! PART I Was in a dilemma for sometime. Didn't take much time to shrug it off. The decision was to attend the workshop on 'After Partition' at the Humanities and Social Science Dept. Seminar Room. It was pre-lunch session of 18th August. Took a short time out though to listen to the Chief Guest of the parallel, IIT Kharagpur 'Foundation Day' program at Netaji Auditorium. On entering the workshop venue, there was the question, gently asked, so much so that one could not miss the empathy-filled undertone - if my family was affected by partition in anyway. That touches a tender nerve somewhere, prompts a time travel through the silhouette of flash backs (partly here).Prof. Amritjit Singh of Ohio University in his keynote speech told how difficult it is to look back at partition dispassionately, specially for the people to the west and east of India. The decision to divide the nation remains the most painful part of our history. The acceptance of hastily drawn boundaries by Radcliffe took the tragedy, the death, destruction, displacement, to its worst possible level. Radcliffe was kind of parachuted in the partition scene, was supplied with incomplete information and he hardly had any knowledge of ground reality.If the partition (and the massacre that followed) happened due to religious differences of two communities, religion becomes the easy-pick villain. It is like Sherlock Holmes saying, \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\" One expert in the workshop made a hint to that by quoting often-used Marx remark, \"Religion is the opium of the people.\" The story-telling session of young students however, had an interesting take. In this session, students who interned in the summer, shared their experiences of interviewing people. These people were from both western and eastern part of the country, who were directly affected by partition. It was a mixed bag of experience for them. While all faced difficult times post migration, the common man in general tried their best to protect their neighbours of other community with their small might. It may make sense to introduce a simple question here. Who is more religious? A common man who feels the pain of his neighbour facing mayhem or the one powerful enough to cause mayhem? In an 1894 letter (Link), Vivekananda explains his brother disciple, \"In every country the evils exist not with, but against, religion. Religion therefore is not to blame, but men.\" Is that so? Let's move to the next segment.PART IIThere is a special characteristic in man which is not there in other animals. That is, man can change his characteristic! The man can become a brute. He can become a saint, too. Life, as defined by Vivekananda, is the unfoldment and development of a being under circumstances tending to press it down. In the lecture, \"The Necessity of Religion\", Vivekananda says, \"Man is man so long as he is struggling to rise above nature, and this nature is both internal and external. ... It is grand and good to know the laws that govern the stars and planets; it is infinitely grander and better to know the laws that govern the passions, the feelings, the will, of mankind. (Link)\"This struggle, this striving, come from one's right of attaining a superior self and that is the fun of being human. Else, how are we different from animal? Bhartrihari put it this way in Nitishataka. येषां न विद्या न तपो न दानं ज्ञानं न शीलं न गुणो न धर्मः। /ते मर्त्यलोके भुवि भारभूता मनुष्यरूपेण मृगाश्चरन्ति॥ For lack of striving to reach one's superior self (through education, penance, charity, knowledge, good conduct, noble qualities, dharma) there is मनुष्यरूपेण मृगाश्चरन्ति - animals move around in human form. (Link)With any special power, comes a great responsibility to use that power properly. That is why we used to hear elderly people blessing us till sometime back, \"Be a man.\" The human form is not enough. A cat or dog need not be told - Be a cat or dog. Browning writes, \"Progress, man's distinctive mark alone. / Not God's, and not the beasts: God is, they are; / Man partly is, and wholly hopes to be.\"(Link) There are challenges on the way. That is why in Swadeshmantra, taken from the article, 'Modern India' (Link), we find Vivekananda praying, \"O Thou Mother of Strength, take away my weakness, take away my unmanliness, and make me a Man!\"PART IIIWhat is the role of religion here? It is there in the direction an individual takes. Again referring to Vivekananda, \"Religion is the manifestation of divinity already in man. It is the idea which is raising the brute unto man, and man unto God. (Link)\" In a letter to Dr. Nanjunda Rao, Vivekananda writes, \"Throughout the history of the world you find great men make great sacrifices and the mass of mankind enjoy the benefit. If you want to give up everything for your own salvation, it is nothing. Do you want to forgo even your own salvation for the good of the world? (Then) You are God, think of that. ... Purity, patience, and perseverance are the three essentials to success and, above all, love.\"(Link)Heard one Ramakrishna order monk coming up with the following classification that defines three different manifestations of man.Beast: Thinks of his own good only, even at the cost of others.Man: Thinks of his own good as well as good of others (doesn't want own good at the cost of others).God: Thinks of good of others only and doesn't bother about his own good.Every religion has three distinct parts: Philosophy, Mythology and Ritual. Philosophy is the essence. Mythology is appreciation of the philosophy through exalted characters that man can connect to. Rituals are to link our everyday life with the highest philosophy, a routine that does not let us forget our goal, attaining of our superior self. Mythology and rituals are to differ across the religions and within a religion due to difference in the evolutionary process undergone by a community in a specific time and space. Their objectives are to take us closer to the philosophy, the essence - the manifestation of divinity remaining the end goal. If there is no manifestation of divinity, there is no religion. \"Religion is being and becoming,\" simply put by Vivekananda.PART IV Coming back to the issue of 'After Partition' devastation and if religion or lack of it is the cause, let us hear what Vivekananda said exactly fifty years before this partition (1897) in a lecture delivered at Triplicane Society, Madras which was titled, 'The Work before Us'. \"You must open your heart. Religion is not going to church, or putting marks on the forehead, or dressing in a peculiar fashion; you may paint yourselves in all the colours of the rainbow, but if the heart has not been opened, if you have not realised God, it is all vain.\" (Link) In a letter written in 1895, Vivekananda says, \"My master (Shri Ramakrishna) used to say that these names, as Hindu, Christian, etc., stand as great bars to all brotherly feelings between man and man. We must try to break them down first. They have lost all their good powers and now only stand as baneful influences under whose black magic even the best of us behave like demons. ... Those that want to help mankind must take their own pleasure and pain, name and fame, and all sorts of interests, and make a bundle of them and throw them into the sea, and then come to the Lord. This is what all the Masters said and did. (Link)\"In the lecture, 'The Methods and Purpose of Religion', Vivekananda says, \"The persons appeal to our emotions; and the principles, to something higher, to our calm judgement. Principles must conquer in the long run, for that is the manhood of man. Emotions many times drag us down to the level of animals. Emotions have more connection with the senses than with the faculty of reason; and, therefore, when principles are entirely lost sight of and emotions prevail, religions degenerate into fanaticism and sectarianism.\" (Link)PART VOn 11th September, 1893 at the World Parliament of Religions, Chicago, Vivekananda uttered (Link),I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught theworld both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universaltoleration, but we accept all religions as true. I am proud to belong to anation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of allreligions and all nations of the earth. I am proud to tell you that we havegathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites, who came toSouthern India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holytemple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny. I am proud to belong to thereligion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grandZoroastriannation. I will quote to you, brethren, a few lines from a hymnwhich I remember to have repeated from my earliest boyhood, which is every dayrepeated by millions of human beings: रुचीनां वैचित्र्यादृजुकुटिलनानापथजुषाम। नृणामेको गम्यस्त्वमसि पयसामर्णव इव।। As the different streams having theirsources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, thedifferent paths which men take through different tendencies, various thoughthey appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee. The present convention, which is one of the most augustassemblies ever held, is in itself a vindication, a declaration to the world ofthe wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita: “Whosoever comes to Me,through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through pathswhich in the end lead to me.” Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horribledescendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They havefilled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood,destroyed civilisation and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been forthese horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now.But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled thismorning in honour of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism,of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitablefeelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.ENDNOTE The far too many references of a 'Patriot-Prophet' in this post is because of the immense clarity ushered in by his speeches and writings,  because his 39 years of life (1863 - 1902) stood for what he said, \"My ideal indeed can be put into a few words and that is: to preach unto mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.\"(Link) Or, it could be something more subtle, the sub-conscious playing out from my soccer-playing days, \"Be strong, my young friends; that is my advice to you. You will be nearer to Heaven through football than through the study of the Gita. These are bold words; but I have to say them, for I love you. I know where the shoe pinches. I have gained a little experience. You will understand the Gita better with your biceps, your muscles, a little stronger. You will understand the mighty genius and the mighty strength of Krishna better with a little of strong blood in you. You will understand the Upanishads better and the glory of the Atman when your body stands firm upon your feet, and you feel yourselves as men.\"(Link)I read little outside Vivekananda literature. But, I read the following. While equating religion with opium, Marx uttered in the same breath, \"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\" (Link)It is our inner cry. We better listen to it and give it the right direction."},
{"title": "Leadership", "date": "Thursday, August 17, 2017", "text": "From December-end# ABVYM Annual Camp (playlist, hosted at Vidyamandir, Belur Math), procured few copies of the booklet titled, \"Leadership: Its Concepts and Qualities\" from the camp book stall. This booklet was part of our recommended reading in our younger days of KVYM. Sri Nabaniharan Mukhopadhyaya writes there,We find and have to admit that there are some differences in creation, in society, in human beings in respect of understanding, qualities, capabilities etc. We can always make use of such special capacity in some for the benefit of those who are on a little lower level, to bring them up, to push them up, to elevate them to help them to make for progress. That is the fundamental idea of leadership.Sundar Pichai came to IIT Kharagpur campus in January beginning. There was a long interactive session (full video) at packed Tagore Open Air Theater. On being asked about his secret of leadership, Sundar told the following,It’s learning to let go and really empowering people at all levels of the organisation, and trusting them to do the right thing. As a leader, a lot of your job is to make those people successful. It’s less about trying to be successful (yourself), and more about making sure you have good people and your work is to remove that barrier, remove roadblocks for them so that they can be successful in what they do. So that’s how I’ve always thought about it. I also value teamwork quite a bit and I think it’s really important to build organisations where people really want to work together. Everything comes out of that. So, setting up collaborative cultures is another big thing I’ve been trying to focus on.Most of the reporting on this section of his speech though missed the pre-requisite part 'making sure you have good people.' There was an apparently innocuous question to follow but answer to that also showed where not to make an error in judgement, keeping the personal an professional space separate. A young student asked if as the CEO of Google, can he change the Google doodle to the IITKGP building for a day. Sundar replies this way. I am going to send a message to the team. (takes his phone out of the pocket and pretends to text a message, applause from audience) Before you get too excited, I mean, the good news is Google is set up in a way so that even if I send that email, they would not do it. Here's the reason why: we have built an organization with strong ideals and values on when we show doodles, for what occasions. And it's less about what I want to happen.It is not easy to bring this sense of trusteeship. One monk of Ramakrishna order was telling that one needs to acquire the spirit of Sanyasins to deliver one's best in this Samsara.#The draft of this post was prepared in January beginning. Today evening, four senior students came to discuss their social work related initiative. While referring to some earlier posts of this blog during the conversation, realized that the draft needs to be pushed to publication stage!!"},
{"title": "2017 begins", "date": "Tuesday, January 3, 2017", "text": "2017 begins! It had to. Because 2016 left. And, we need a time axis to build our towers! The first working day of 2017 was yesterday, a Monday, the 2nd of January. Job card was there at hand. The car needed a wash before daughter gets dropped at school. No excuse is allowed in the beginning of the year. In that case, the wise says that the whole year will ask for excuses.Next comes the much celebrated morning walk. Tried chasing a loud speaker sound for sometime to identify the source. It is that season of the year when Usha-Kirtans render the air. Found that it was actually an echo and the source lies very far. Got back to the usual track. On the way found that 'Senior Class Gift 2015' is inscribed in newly constructed roadside benches.Reached the favourite part of the track. This under-repaired part requires little balancing act to walk on. The challenge can be avoided by taking the good road next to it. But that little stretch gives useful feedback. The lack of balance, if any, is indicator of something!Little bit of free hand exercise and Suryanamaskar. The sun is brighter now. Ready, steady and on my mark for next task in the morning. Visit to market to refill the vegetable basket and checking out the fish market. A quick chat with a colleague. Topic: External discipline promotes internal discipline. Wondered if there can be a group exercise in a big playground together.Bath is followed by breakfast. Time to rush to office. A fun get-together was there to welcome the new year. Exchange of greetings and calorie gain. Now, ready for serious intellectual exercise. Discussion with two senior most research students. For the first, review report for a IEEE Trans. paper has come. Revision needs to be completed within six weeks. Later, a telecon on getting fund available for two project students for some more time. Also, exchange of messages with another funding agency as coordinator of some activities. In the lunch break, visited a colleague's quarter. The family asked for suggestion on two different lines of treatment. Back to office and start of editing work of a manuscript to be sent to a journal. A short visit to office tea shop. A discussion on admin. matter. And, editing work continues. Wanted to finish it before going home. The clock strikes 9 PM. It was becoming riskier to take things that much granted. Twenty percent of editing work was left for next day. I was correct. Needed sometime to give to daughter on her study. It was 11 PM. My current bedtime favourite is:Endnote: Exchange of New Year greetings in different forum continued throughout the day. There are students (recent pass out) with such samskars even now to write 'Charan Sparsh' (Touching your feet) in their new year message. Among others there was one who works in IT sector, few years junior to me. He published his first literary work recently which is liked by many. After 'Pranam' part, he wanted to know if I would be free on 7th Jan. Saturday, the day Kharagpur Book Fair starts. He and other authors would be coming down to Kharagpur for a seminar / panel discussion. I said, 'Yes' thinking that I would be listening to experts among whom there would be one who I know for long!!!Classroom teaching begins on 05-01-2017."},
{"title": "Ropewalk ", "date": "Saturday, December 31, 2016", "text": "When one popular online social platform was flooding timelines with year end review in the beginning of this month, someone made a prophetic observation that it was too early! May be the deep or not-so-deep learning there was not given an opportunity to get trained on Sharukh dialogue of Om Shanti Om, \"picture abhi baki hai mere dost.\" May be it was part of its training set but something considered smarter there directed it towards a different pool by spotting certain keyword! Therefore, a picture which is a contender for the 'picture of the year', not for its look but for its significance, gets a miss in that platform.The picture was with one of my illustrious colleague in an unusual place and in an unusual hour, from our uncanny ability not to miss the fun side even in a trying condition.Shreya and PreyaThough real life drama can surprise reel life counterpart at times, one needs to watch the end scenes of Kahani 2 to make the meaning of the dialogue, \"teri promotion ki ***\" in the context it is uttered or that of \"umeed mei to jivan hai.\" From today's show to last week's! That too was a Part 2 sequel. The dialogue was something like this, \"hum jo karna pasand karte hain aur jo karte hain, usi ki beech mein hamara kamjori, nehi to hamara shakti chhupa raheti hain.\"It is worth taking note of verse 1.2.2 of Kathopnishad in this context.श्रेयश्च प्रेयश्च मनुष्यमेतस्तौ संपरीत्य विविनक्ति धीरः । श्रेयो हि धीरोऽभिप्रेयसो वृणीते प्रेयो मन्दो योगक्शेमाद्वृणीते ॥Both the good and the pleasant approach the mortal; the intelligent man examines and distinguishes them; for, the intelligent man prefers the good to the pleasant; the ignorant man chooses the pleasant for the sake of his body. Shankar's commentary on this can be found here.And we were taught, he is the intelligent who can make what is good, likable.Balancing Equity and Excellence But there are other kind of dilemma than shreya and preya. Listened to an interesting speech yesterday. For an administrator, balancing equity and excellence is not easy. While equity asks for equal distribution of resources, excellence requires allocation of more resource for the one who deserves more. In this, equity comes in the form of equal opportunity given to all to reach that deserving spot and those who do reach, get a spring board. But there is a catch here. Equity remains the overarching principle. Investment in excellence does not contradict that principle if the output of the excellence is ploughed back to promote better level of equity and, is not considered a mere entitlement. Thus, who gets the spring board, carry with them a responsibility.This is more like a village farmer who does not have means to give good education to all four kids puts more effort on the most intelligent one, sends him to a city for higher education that follows a good career. The aim for him is to see that son raising the condition of the other three brothers in the village when established. If the city boy disconnects his cord or shrugs off his responsibility then the farmer should have considered equal spend on education for all four kids, by which other three could have lived incrementally better life. This could have put a high cost to the first one but one might not find that to be unjustified. Because he is not ready do his bit to improve condition of the other three, at least to a level higher than what that incremental better life for equal spend on four would have provided. This quantification can decide the dividend percentage for that equity.Strength of CharacterComing back to Tum Bin 2 dialogue on the gap between what we think and and what we do, where lies our character strength or weakness, heard something interesting on this count too. What we are or what we are not, is known when a gun is put on our head or when a gun is given in our hand; that Abraham Lincoln said if you want to know a person's character, give him power.Education plays an important role in the building up of character. Educators and the ambiance created by academic administrators are key to make the process work. Career and character - one prepares the taught to face the external and the other to face the internal upheavals. In Vivekananda's words, \"We want that education by which character is built, intellect is developed, strength of mind is increased and one can stand on one's own feet.\" We are always better off if we do not cease to learn and have the courage to face what comes as an obstacle (both internal and obstacle) to become a better human being.ABVYM Annual CampAttended Annual Camp of Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal earlier this week for few hours. This 50th edition was held in B. Ed training college and Vidyamandir, adjacent to Belur Mutt. There were 2346 campers attending it from all over the country, mostly from different centres of Mahamndal. The 5 and 1/2 day long camp is to inculcate man making and character building idea among youth.Being PatriotIn the camp, listened to one hour lecture of Swami Nikhilatmanadaji of Beneras Ramakrishna Mission on 'Message of Swami Vivekananda.' Quoting Vivekananda he said, \"Feel, therefore, my would-be reformers, my would-be patriots! Do you feel? Do you feel that millions and millions of the descendants of gods and of sages have become next-door neighbours to brutes? Do you feel that millions are starving today, and millions have been starving for ages? Do you feel that ignorance has come over the land as a dark cloud? Does it make you restless? Does it make you sleepless? Has it gone into your blood, coursing through your veins, becoming consonant with your heartbeats? Has it made you almost mad? Are you seized with that one idea of the misery of ruin, and have you forgotten all about your name, your fame, your wives, your children, your property, even your own bodies? Have you done that? That is the first step to become a patriot, the very first step.\"This quote was from Vivekanda's lecture, 'My Plan of Campaign\", delivered at Madras (full lecture). Maharaj asked all to go ough this and other lectures under the series \"Lectures from Colombo to Almora.\" It was a great experience to be in that camp. (Video playlist)EndnoteTaking correct decision, timing it right, following the process - all seem to be a kind of burden if seen in isolation. It may appear a tight rope walk to balance competing interests. Strength of character, working in a team who too believe in shreya over preya, adherence to fundamental principles of life and a sense of trusteeship hold key.Tall trees giving shades, bringing rain and blossoming flowers: Making of an academic campus!"},
{"title": "Full Circle", "date": "Saturday, July 9, 2016", "text": "Heard of it on two consecutive Saturdays. The first was a short get-together of old pals last Saturday in Kolkata. I was told that some of my facebook posts are beyond comprehension, go above the head! Move to this Saturday. It is more aptly put for the latest post there, \".. sometimes your thought becomes a bit abstract for mere mortals like us.... but what is a thought from a professor without a bit of abstractness may I say so...\"Highest truths are always simpleThat actually is the case. Today morning in the market met a High School friend with whom connection was lost for long. Among other things, he talked about this six month old post which was special for him. May be the 'abstractness', the lack of clarity leave room for many different interpretations. How one interprets or the perspective, becomes more important (centre of focus) than what is interpreted. That might have its own value.I ___ , therefore I amWhat is the right word to complete the above sentence? Met another High School friend today morning while in market. He is now a lead member of the executive committee of Kharagpur Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal. Assured him of attending tomorrow's Karmi Sammelan if it doesn't rain. The venue is a place 5 KM away where only 2 wheelers can go. The other two short meetings in the market were with two colleagues. In one, apprised a junior colleague of a possible path he can take. In the other, a very senior faculty remembered those days when I worked in his team in my first extra-academic assignment.More than a meeting placeThere were not much scope to converse with shopkeepers on a busy weekend like this. The grocery shop person made aware that a PET jar is given for free if I take 2 liters of mustard oil instead of my usual purchase of 1 liter. The fish-seller told that she was selling fish to me at cost price for being MFC (Most Favoured Customer). The vegetable-seller didn't mind giving change of a Rs. 1000 currency note as SBI ATM didn't leave other option. Only the flower-seller was little complaining that I was not being regular. Was little worried to reach home late from market but luck was in favour.Shortest routeTook bath quickly. It was 'Bipad-tarini' (one who rescues from trouble, a form of goddess Kali or Chandi) Puja day. Only after Puja there will be the license to eat. Rushed to Shiva-Kali temple at the outskirt of IIT Kharagpur campus. Puja was done nicely. Additionally, tried a new route which appeared to me as a sort of discovery. This appears to be the shortest route from our quarter to Shiva-Kali Mandir, a distance of 1.4 KM. The path found was not to be the widest one and thus, less drive-friendly. And, it remained unexplored till date. Heard the other day that novelty, innovation lie in doing things that are counter-intuitive.IntuitionBy definition, it is the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning. It is not as random as it sounds. There is a method in everything. There is a process of naturalization by which certain things get assimilated within us. It has more to do with the exposures we do get and what we do with that.Human excellenceIn his lecture on \"Swami Vivekananda and Human Excellence\" at Harvard University, Swami Ranganathananda presented an interesting observation. Post World War II a UNESCO appointed commission, presided over by then French Education Minister who later became Prime Minister, started investigating the nature of education humanity needs. The commission submitted a report after analyzing the current systems of education and demands of the new human situation in post-war period.'Learning to be'Yes, that was the title of the report submitted by the UNESCO appointed commission. Till now education has been essentially learning to do. The commission said that while retaining learning to do, the post war education must add also learning to be. \"What are you? is equally, if not more, important than what you do.\"Work efficiencyQuoting Chandogya Upanishad (yadeva vidyayā karoti, śraddhaya, upanisadā, tadeva vīryavattaraṃ bhavatīti), it was told that vidya i.e. science or knowledge of doing things, sraddha i.e. faith in oneself or astikyabuddhi - a totality of positive attitude and upanishad i.e. deep / meditative thinking on the subject, bring out vīryavattaraṃ i.e. superior energy. Put together, whatever is done with vidya, sraddha and upanishad, that alone becomes supremely efficient.Dimension of EducationSwami Ranganathanada continues. The educated citizen is the source from which modern democratic society receives nourishment. That education must include not only intellectual knowledge but also these other two values as well (sraddha and upanishad). The more we neglect the to be aspect of education, the more vulnerable this civilization becomes. And our intuition or the lack of it, would help or fail us.A conversation-\"Sir, you would be surprised.. I got a paper published from my MTech Project.\"--\"Excellent. PlosOne is a very good journal. Why in Bank then?\"- \"I am into healthcare so I get to use my technical knowledge to understand companies and develop business acumen too.\"- \"We have some fund and I was wondering if we can help any village around KGP. Please advise.\"- \"Hello Sir, any thoughts?\"--\"NSS works in 18 villages. It can conduct a survey in x no. of villages depending on quantum of fund. Possibly one village would be good to start with. The survey will identify  no. of household without toilet.\"And the money was transferred recently. More is assured when the sum given is utilized. NSS students of current batch are to work on it in the coming session. To bring a full circle to this, I may say that the conversation was with an alumnus who is one of the name and face of this four year old NSS IIT Kharagpur post.The story continuesThere was a mail few months back in my inbox from an ex-student with whom interaction was for only 2 months in Summer Quarter way back in 2008. The mail with the subject line \"I am 'Mon' from your blog\" goes like this.I still remember very clearly my days of summer quarter in KGP when you used to teach us Basic Electronics course in which I had miserable flunked. I believe that SQ was the best thing happened to my academic career in Kgp. Not just Electronics I was able to learn the best lessons of life during this time. The blog I am referring is: http://gskgp.blogspot.in/2008/06/summer-quarter-experience.htmlI am visiting Kgp this Holi, would love to see you in the campus.And we had a long chat when he visited campus. Now working in a responsible position in an MNC, he maintains his connection with CRY IIT Kharagpur.New SessionThis is that time of the season when we get phone calls seeking various supports as new batch of students enter the campus. They come from various background. Majority perhaps were too busy with academics and had to work extra hard to get into such a coveted institution. They make take it as a prize of their and their parents' effort. And it may not be out of place to think that they have every right to enjoy the fruit of their labour and explore how the IIT degree can work to their advantage.ResponsibilityWhile one cannot take the credit away from the incumbent and their family, there is something more that assume significance. I recall what I told the son of my IITKGP UG day's batch-mate few years back when he joined here as a fresher. Our country is not rich enough to give IIT like infrastructure / facility to every youth. A student here has an implicit responsibility to put to its best use what is offered to him and, work towards elevating others who do not get the same opportunity, are deprived of in some way or the other. The standard advice on how to do well here can be found in earlier posts like this and this.Endnote\"Knock! Knock!\" And a gentle push opened the door slowly.\"Sorry, Sir! You are there!\" The students were fumbling. \"We thought that you had gone home but forgot to switch-off the lights and lock the door! We were worried.\"It was a 10:30 PM some weeks back. The research students were taking break from their lab. work as per their regular schedule. And they had seen that maximum hour for me to stay in office was 10:00 PM, till that time.P.S.: While mind makes its own adjustment with the arrow of time, the body goes through an annual check every summer. This year's check shows that of the two parameters in yellow zone (rest in green) one is making a move towards green zone. The step count app of the mobile phone is not that inaccurate. It clocked 7000+ steps today!"},
{"title": "New Year 2016", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2016", "text": "/* Two consecutive posts in this blog. I must not be holidaying :-)  */New MemberIt was July, 1990. Done with graduation from here, joined my first job at Tata Steel, Jamshedpur. Accommodation was at GT Hostel, Kadma. Nice atmosphere. Soccer at floodlight in the adjacent Tata Football Academy ground. Occasional fight with them over territorial rights. The steel plant was few KM away. Just reached 22 years. It was time to look for options beyond cycling.The Rajdoot RD 175 bike was part of me for 16 long years and was parted with when repairing became difficult. Had many, many memories of it, with it - in those momentous years of life. At Jamshedpur, Kharagpur, Bandel and then back again at Kharagpur. Last days of father, PhD days, Marriage, taking daughter to nursery school (attached is a March, 2006 picture when the school was over, our current quarter fencing can be seen in the background, same road; at that time we were staying in a quarter near PAN loop).It was difficult to say bye to that Rajdoot bike. But had to. Came Honda Shine 125. But the feeling of a 38 year old is quite different from that of a 22 years. It was more of a utility vehicle. It served its purpose and absence of self-start, requirement to buy Pep+ for HH and arrival of Maruti 800, made one ask its utility. The Pep+ was to be used so that the battery remains charged and HH can use self-start whenever she decided to venture out, may be twice or thrice a week.Thus, Honda bike was parted with after seven years and for last 2 years, I was bike-less! Maruti 800, Pep+ and walk were the modes. But off late, started facing some issues. The major one is due to HH becoming more proficient in riding 2-wheeler, wanted it at her disposal for anytime visit to market, friends' places. And, 4-wheeler is not convenient to visit villages / slums. The biggest trouble used to be rushing back home from such a visit at the requirement of HH. Thus, decided to gift myself a new bike in the new year. Also thought, if the first and middle phase of life had one each, why not the last phase too! Thus, a new member joined the family - Hero Achiever 150. The registration no. is yet to be obtained.PriorityHH and daughter arrived at quarter after 10 day long vacation trip. It was evening time. Daughter rushed to garage to see the new bike. HH got busy checking how the flower-plants were doing in her absence. She was full of joy to see a rose plant doing excellent this time which was not the case in earlier years. And petunias, dahlia, marigold, others clocking healthy growth. It took long 15 minutes to assess the various parts of the garden and then shifting priority to have a look at the new bike.Meanwhile, myself and daughter developed an excuse to take a small ride in the new bike to visit Tech. Market to buy some thing. It is another matter that the same thing was available in a local shop at walking distance. On return, in spite of all the warnings not to catch cold in a chilly winter evening, the daughter took her time to decorate the Christmas Tree in front of our quarter with bells, herself.Tomorrow is the first class of the new year, both for school and the institute. I was nearly done with preparation for the first class. One book was required to be brought from Dept. office almirah. And the daughter found that she needs new year cards to be bought to give to friends tomorrow in school. So, were at it again. Another ride from quarter to Tech. Market to Dept. and back.InspirationNew year is associated with greetings card, calendar, diary, messages, emails, phone calls. Prepared an e-greeting card for wishing certain audience (Link). It was not that the official greeting card of the institute wouldn't do, but the personal touch often carries the message better when we are working in a team. In the new year celebration of the lab., one recited a poem on calendar itself that was written by him. All shared how was 2015 and what they were looking forward to in 2016.I drew their attention to being balanced in their approach towards what they think, act; and on importance of concentration - ability to focus and withdraw mind at one's own will. Thus goes the Vivekananda quote that I draw inspiration from, \"If I had to do my education over again, and had any voice in the matter, I would not study facts at all. I would develop the power of concentration and detachment, and then with a perfect instrument I could collect facts at will.\"One young student came into facebook message box. \"Happy New year Sir! Hope you keep inspiring us for years to come!\" I would put it the other way. It is the students and people around who keep inspiring me with their good thoughts and good deeds. It is such a joy to to see people striving for a better world/ society through acts that do not allow selfish interests to get better of them. And we heard, \"Unselfishness is God.\" Other way speaking - Show me an unselfish person, I shall show you God.The other thing that inspires me a lot is the courage, resolve shown to face the life's struggle. One student in the new year meet was in tears to narrate how was 2015. For last eight months she is away from her 1.5 year old daughter who stays with grand mother in ancestral place, 500 KM away. Because of her academic work, a full time PhD which she wants to finish in time, she tried keeping grand-mother here but it did not work. Now every month, for few days  she visits daughter. And we remembered that facebook photo where a mother was carrying bricks in large numbers in a construction site with baby tied to her back.The first calendar of 2016 was gifted by office-bearers of Satya Sai Seva Trust who visited a week back. They conduct free disaster management training program besides many other service oriented activities (some earlier picture link). I get a Tata Steel diary from Bearings Division of Tata Steel when I visit their place in 3rd / 4th week of Jan. Every year, unfailingly they arrange a program on Vivekananda (one earlier link). They rang and told that this year it would be on 23rd Jan. Few days back, one journalist of a lead English daily rang. His acquaintance who run an NGO, is coming up with a school and there is inauguration. The list continues. And I echo the message received from an unexpected quarter today, from faculty of a reputed non-IIT institute where this new year gave an opportunity to start an interaction, \"May this new year bring peace, prosperity and happiness for all of us.\"Endnote: I would like to leave it blank this time."},
{"title": "ABVYM Annual Camp 2015", "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2015", "text": "It was about 9 AM of last Sunday, one of those end-Dec. days when Her Highness visits ancestral place to take care of certain other things there. Checked with Ma, she was feeling much better that day (nothing serious, old age has its ups and downs). I made a quick estimate. Yes, I can finish shopping, cooking etc. and push-off for the 2:25 PM EMU local, for a seven-hour round trip to a place called Panskura. It would be 50 minutes train journey from Kharagpur station towards Howrah.Ma happily obliged. I was going to Panskura to attend the afternoon / evening session of 5-day long annual camp of Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal (ABVYM). The word 'Mahamandal' itself brings joy, a glow in our family for the contribution it had on us and in our neighbourhood. The other day HH came from local market, excited. Has any Mahamandal member of Kharagpur unit joined a book shop in the market? I answered in negative, at least I was not aware of. Came the reply - but the young boy, could be a college student, had the look, and the way he presented himself!Went to market. Bumped on Anjan, another Mahamandal product, a self-made man who runs two schools and has tremendous entrepreneurial spirit. He visited camp on 25th Dec. and was to go again on 29th because it would have Swami Balabhadranadaji's lecture in the evening session. But, as soon as he heard that I would be going that day, he thought that there was nothing wrong with 27th either :-).Shopping, cooking, lunch, medicine to Ma - all done and there was Anjan with his bike at our quarter at 1:30 PM. Together we boarded that 2:25 PM train. When we got down at Panskura station, we found Prabodh-da and another young companion of him, all going to camp. Prabodh-da too is from Kharagpur unit. His son and seven other from Kharagpur, are attending this camp for all five days.Took vacation leave from office for visiting the camp again on 29th Dec. This time Sujoy, Kanchan, Anuj - a different set of Kharagpur unit oldies accompanied and also eight other young persons. While it was pre-planned that myself and Sujoy would go together, Anuj and Kanchan's decision to join was sudden. Anuj rang in the morning thanking me for my facebook post on 27th Dec. camp visit and when he heard that we would be going that day, he was in. For Kanchan, there was celebration of birth anniversary of their diksha-guru, Swami Swarupananda - Babamoni. He freed himself, had early prasad and joined the team. For youngsters in the team, a proposal was made previous evening and the number swelled to eight. Gifted these young companions a small book on \"Leadership: Its Concept and Qualities\" written by Sri Nabaniharan Mukhopadhyaya from the camp site book stall. Had an interaction with the author in the camp who has been the main driving force of ABVYM since its inception in 1967.At the end of the picture series below, there are videos that has two interesting lectures on \"Vivekananda and Technical Education\" by Swami Vedarupananda, Ramakrishna Mission Shilpamandir, Saradapith (Link) and \"Vivekanada's Philosophy of Work\" by Swami Balabhadrananda, Assistant Secretary, Belur Math (Link). In the first, among others, the theory of adoption of technological skill brings unemployment, is bunked. In the latter, it was explained how work efficiency improves without creating bondage / backlash through practice of non-attachment.There are few other short duration videos that shows different aspects of this camp - the flag-down ceremony (1), the physical skill demonstration by children's wing (1), prayer (1), song (1), Q and A session (1, 2), camp kitchen / dining, book stall (1,2 ) and also typical camp announcements (1).Camp Pictures:Camp Videos:An audio of evening lecture in Day 2 of camp on \"Vivekananda and World Peace\" in Bengali by Sri Birendra Kumar Chakraborty, Secretary, ABVYM: LinkEndnote: There was email, phone call, SMS. A discussion was to take place on certain official activity where a faculty from another IIT was to come here. It happened yesterday evening. While we could wrap up the official matters in 15 minutes, the next 30 minutes went in sharing ideas and experiences on certain common interests. The young faculty and his wife work for  rescued children through an NGO, teach yoga in juvenile home etc. They have a team of 10 members in that campus and every weekend, 5-6 members of that team engage some of their time for the social cause in rotation. He showed me some of the photographs of the children he worked with. I showed him some of the activities being carried out here and also nararted experience of this ABVYM Annual Camp and NSS, IIT Kharagpur Annual Camp.And, I had to email the young faculty twice at his request. The first time, I mailed him the weblink of that official activity. The second mail had link of this blog. I had the opportunity of reporting NSS, IIT Kharagpur 7-day long Annual Camp experiences in NSS, IIT Kharagpur blog (8 posts from Nov. 28 to Dec. 05, 2015). While I could attend ABVYM Annual Camp on 2 days, I visited NSS, IIT Kharagpur camp everyday except for one day as I had to be in the national launch of IMPRINT-India by Hon. President in presence of Hon. Prime Minister at Rashtrapati Bhavan."},

Also, there is the 'live for thee' that gives purpose to a life when comes the question - Why? What for? Does it worth?Yesterday afternoon. A discussion with themecoordinator in a national roadmap building exercise.  Healthcare should not position itself only asSickcare. Caring health when we are healthy, adopting healthy life style, will reduce disease burden of the country. Well, could that be the necessary condition to deserve such an opening sentence? Doesn’t seem so. A routine activity can do anything buttrigger.WhenaloneCut to a different scene. About 9 PM ofyesterday evening. It was a Monday evening. Midsem. Exam. Started. Still inoffice. As usual. Had to complete and mail slides for an important videoconference, scheduled today. Comes a phone. A UG student is on the other side.  Sir, I got admitted in hospital this morningwith high fever. Appeared in today’s exam. from hospital. Now, I am feeling somewhat better.  My next exam is day after tomorrow. Alone instudent cabin wanted to talk to somebody. My friends must be preparing now fortheir exam., do not want to disturb them. Your thought came. Read in your blogthat you as a student appeared in a semester exam. from this hospital. And we talked a while. His father, inIndore, wanted to come here. Worried, since it is exam. time. The student askedhim not to.  Whois in whose familyAs if it was not enough. The same yesterday. A PG student appeared at office door with a glowing face. I amgetting better results now. How? It is same time-frequency features. But bydoing feature selection with stricter p-value criterion. Number of features isreduced. But poorer features seem to get eliminated and the model is doingbetter. Very good! I am coming to the lab. shortly and shall examine. Sir, tables,plots are already sent to you and is in your inbox. You can see from here. Shesat down. And her too was an exhaustive study, characteristic signature of ourlab. students. The novelty, contribution part are for others to comment. I can vouch for the sincerity, effort, detailed analysis part of it.  We were half way through our discussion onthose analysis of EEG signals and interpreting functioning of brain. A knock at the door.Parents there. Both, specially the mother, are active social worker. She ispart of CSR work taken up by members of a nearby Industry, from house of TATAs.Recently they conducted a program together with some of our UG students in aneighbourhood village. They came to IITKGP for some other work. Found that the lightis on in my office. Wanted to discuss a new proposal with me, lighting up of approach road of one crematorium. The research student, their daughter, gavea look at parents which I am not unfamiliar with. I get more of that from mydaughter at home. Parents were kind of apologetic, embarrassed to enter inbetween a discussion. Made them feel comfortable. Told them that their daughteris now part of our IIT Kharagpur family and they have higher priority. We can continue theresearch discussion later. They have to travel some distance to return home. The picture inthis post was whatsapp-ed by these parents earlier. They clicked this in apublic gathering of Sathya Sai Seva Organization, held one week back.Thethread that connectsThis again relates to a telephone call of yesterday.The student was calling from home. The father developed a heart relatedproblem. Kolkata hospital told that holter test is required and possiblypacemaker after that. The hospital cannot conduct that test and told them toget it done from outside within certain date. The place where they stay has only one such centre inthe district and that is booked till 12th of October. The student wantedto discuss what can be done.Hurrah!The fourth one from yesterday, connected to this thread, issomething that almost made me jump in joy. There was the elder brother, asenior research student, who appeared in my office. His father had a fall intoilet few days back. Since he had other health problems the family went for aKolkata specialty hospital 200 KM from their village. Fellow students pooledmoney to meet the emergency and one of them accompanied him. After successfuloperation, the father is now back home. The student gave this report of hisfather’s health. Then there was a pause. He smiled. And then said, Sir, brotherhas got a job. A Govt. job, contractual in the beginning. Both of us had broadsmiles in our face. How much we (me and the elder brother) shared amongourselves, both worries and possible opportunities, and how to push the younger brotherto deliver his best. The younger brother worked hard and full credit to him.The family even in a distressed situation like this when the father is ill,feel relieved cannot conceal joy.SharedspaceStudents are at the centre in a campusenvironment with whom both parents and teachers connect to. The environment hasinherent in it making of a bigger family out of its residents. Of my 700+ FBfriends, 600+ would be students from here, mostly UG, many of them are nowsettled in their respective professional lives. All such student friends haveone thing in common. The requests came from them. It is their greatness to considerpeople from another generation as ‘Friend’ and share their space with us. Itwas nice to learn that both the generations will be present together inRashtrapati Bhavan for national launch of something significant. Would-bewinners of a student essay competition (Link) will be invited there and it will be ajoy to share space with them.EpilogueLet me end this by copy-pasting FB commentof one of my friend from our generation, a Professor at University of London,our collaborator in brain research related activity. The context was an earlier posting of this blog. The post reappeared in reference to a student leddiscussion held last week on - Unselfishness is more paying, but one does nothave the patience to practise it.An interesting post. It reminds me of a storyI have read. A senior monk was speaking to a group of young monks and to make apoint, showed a large jar and put it on the table, He produced a few fist sizedrocks and placed them one by one into the jar. Whenno more rocks could be fit, he asked \"is the jar ful?\" Everyonereplied in chorus, \"yes\". He then pulled out a bucket of gravel,dumped some in the jar, shook and dumped more. It quickly filled the spacesbetween the rocks. Again he asked, \"is this jar full?\" The monkshesitated, and one replied, \"probably not.\" He replied,\"good\" and then brought some sand and dumped the sand into jar untilit filled all the crevices. Again he asked, \"is the jar full?\" Themonks were catching up, so shouted, \"No.\" The senior then grabbed apitcher of water and poured it until the jar was filled to the brim. Then heasked \"what is the point of this demonstration?\"Oneyoung monk responded, \"the point is no matter how full your day is, youcan always fit more things in.\"\"No\"replied the wise monk, \"the point is if you don't put the big rocks infirst, you will never get them in at all. So set the life's priorities and leadyour life accordingly.\"Oneyoung monk responded, \"the point is no matter how full your day is, youcan always fit more things in.\"\"No\"replied the wise monk, \"the point is if you don't put the big rocks infirst, you will never get them in at all.

Patel Hall of Residence that is named after Sardar Patel, besides other program arranged a blood donation camp today. There was another such camp organized by NCC at Technology Students Gymkhana. The target had been to collect 150 units from Patel Hall and 100 units from Gymkhana.I may say that I had the opportunity of attending blood donation camps organized by NSS, NCC before. This time,wanted to spend more time in Patel Hall to see how it is organized when students of an undergraduate hall takes the lead. There were other reasons too but let it be left to guess work of the readers (Hint: Some connection with this Hall and...). In the morning, attended a training program on Self-defence organized by NSO Health and Fitness team. A post on this is uploaded a short while ago here (Link).Coming back to how the blood donation camp went, if it looked more like a festival, we can leave it to visuals. The seven part video series mostly contains the blood donation camp activities at Patel Hall. At the end, had a brief visit to NCC organized camp at Gymkhana.Part I of the video series shows the preparatory work done since the arrival of the blood bank team. This may give a feel of the start-up activities to would-be organizers of blood donation camps.Part II shows how it get started by following up first few donors in the queue. Their and others' interview appears in Part VII of this series.Part III shows the donation activities going on in full swing.Part IV shows the continuous stream of donors and their enthusiasm and spirit, making it look more like a festival.Part V shows the blood donation camp going on in parallel at Gymkhana premises and also a short take of Professor Lt. Col. Raju who was in lead of that camp.Part VI shows a conversation with the organizing team of Patel Hall which is followed up by wardens speaking their mind. There is an indication of what we can expect in future. Feeling great!Part VII shows what had been the motivation of some of the donors when I could get into a conversation with them soon after their donation of blood. This series would never be complete without listening to these young hearts. It is sure to serve as motivation to those who are yet come out of their inhibition in donating blood. One cannot but be moved by the great enthusiasm and spirit shown by them and many of them had been first time donors in these camps.Some images of the blood donation:Finally, the smiles say it all - feel proud of them and all who came forward!"},

But when a student comes to us, there is no choice but to shake-off the inertia and keep aside all those excuses. By inertia, I mean - inertia of motion and NOT inertia of rest, Mind It! - in the Rajani style :-)About 10 days back, a 3rd year UG student came to me at the end of a lecture class. Though I ask many times if anyone has any difficulty to follow and not to feel shy about it, there may be few who would prefer one-to-one discussion to clear any doubt. But this time, the attention was sought for a different reason. \"Sir, many students here follow your blog or facebook postings. Could you please share one of our effort that aims to serve the society? If you do, then it will reach out to many.\" I requested him to send the material. Always wondered if what I scribble here or share in facebook are having overtones that may not be a big draw for general audience. Watching 'Two States', 'Bang-Bang' or 'Haider' does not necessarily make one contemporary or understand general psyche of today's youth. Heard from our cinema projection team that the student show of 'Haider' was more than full-house - even the stair-cases were not spared. The other occasion when I got little off-balance years back was an IEEE student symposium. In that,  at the end of my introduction that ran through my CV, there was an additional reference to me as a 'blogger.'The adjoining facebook conversation says it all. The effort of this student group tries to come up with a database of voluntary blood donors. One can enroll oneself by filling-up this online form (KGP BloodConnect). One can also give suggestion to the young team to help them deliver better and I may add, a word of encouragement would motivate them a lot. In coming up with this post, found that the previous 'Teacher's Day 2014' post (Link) was remaining half-done for more than a month now. Completed it with Sept. date stamp. Without that the Sept. field would have gone empty!

You must be concealing your health problem.

{"title": "Independence", "date": "Sunday, August 24, 2014", "text": "Vidya, the five year old came to the campus on Wednesday evening with her parents. It was drizzling when they were to return. Vidya was having fun while parents were arranging rain cover for the scooter ride. Interestingly, they did not look worried about what would happen if it starts raining heavily. They had to travel to a place called Subhaspally, 6-7 KM from IIT Kharagpur campus. The father works in Govt. service in Karnataka, the mother is a homemaker.Today afternoon our family went to meet and greet Medha, the six months old in her first rice ceremony. Vidya had some issue on why all gifts from guests were meant for the sister. The whole family of Vidya and Medha - parents, uncle, aunt, grand parents were full of joy. Medha too obliged all guests and did not treat them as strangers, was comfortable in our lap too. In a lighter mood we told the parents that we may ask when we make a telephone call, \"Connect to Vidya\" or \"Connect to Medha\" whenever we have any disconnect with our own Vidya or Medha! The gathering had old pals with whom I spent my younger days of Sanga Chhadhhang, Sang baddwadhang and weekly study-circles. My daughter was caught off-guarded once in this gathering on her Math. lessons. This is when one came to us and after exchange of greetings told my daughter that he scored poorly in Math. in Class VIII and then joined the 'Free Coaching Centre' that we used to run and learnt Math. from me.Had fun! Environment was excellent! Second daughter - but it is not an issue for the family unlike what we hear elsewhere so much so that the Prime Minister of India needs to refer to it in his Independence Day speech. \"Have we seen our sex ratio? Who is creating this imbalance? Not God. I appeal to the doctors not to kill the girl child in the mother's womb. I request the parents not to kill daughters because they want a son. Don't kill daughters in the womb, it is a blot on 21st century India. I have seen families where one daughter serves parents more than five sons. (Link)\"  The names Medha and Vidya show how much the parents value education themselves and for their daughters.Some days before one student asked me to forward a letter to be given to security section where the persons named in the letter can issue key to work on weekends. What came as sweet surprise and was somewhat unusual in this letter brought by her, is that girls were in majority in the list. In last two years, girls outdid the boys in joining as research students in our lab. The trend is there in other research lab.s too and in the institute as a whole. This increase put a challenge to our infrastructure and major steps have been taken to increase the number of accommodation for girl students.General to more specific. Got one mail from a PhD aspirant months back. She could not be shortlisted in our Dept. due to some reason at her end but was shortlisted in another Dept. She was coming for interview and wanted to talk to me. It was educative for me to know her life's struggle. Father died early. She studied hard and did well to earn free studentship that includes engineering and completed MTech. Now she wants to pursue PhD but the mother wants her to join a high paying PSU job she got from campus and get married. Her brother is still studying. She requested another six months from the mother. And if she does not get admission in a PhD program of her choice in an IIT within that time she would take up job. The determination I saw in her made me see what was in store and I encouraged that day and later through email reply. She did well in test and joined as a PhD scholar. I was not surprised when there was a 'Thank You' visit some weeks back.Facebook brought some distant relatives closer. She is one of our very distant relative and the relationship is so hierachical and family-tree based that I am 'Grandfather' of her who is about 20 years younger to me. Once a year we used to meet in our family function of worship of goddess 'Kali - the Mother' in our ancestral place. Kali worship used to take whole night. On the sideline, I used to conduct quiz, mental Math. for all children gathered. We used to have about 250 family members gathered in one place in this annual function. And this 'granddaughter' of mine used to be very prompt in answering.Elsewhere I have mentioned that how our family had to struggle to get settled here at the partition of India during Independence (Link). The larger family took different number of generations to come to terms where basic needs could be addressed easily. This granddaughter belonged to such a branch of the tree who are yet to come out of the worry of 'what and how'. She completed graduation and prepared for banking service examination. She did very well in exam. for Probationary Officer (P.O.) selection and there came the time when results were to be published. She was so confident that she did not join another Govt. job of lower position that she got few months back.But appointment letter was not coming! Did she make a mistake not to accept the other job? Is it going back to the days of despair after the ray of hope that could change their lot? She used to write occasionally, worried - some from their batch got appointment letter while she had not etc. Once she wrote that it is not Postman, she is looking at appearance of God with appoinment letter in hand in the doorway. I asked her to study Vivekananda and not to give up. Used to share how we overcame challenging times.And then came the time. After joining as P.O. she wrote after few weeks that she wants to devote a part of her for the society and social cause and asked suggestion. The desire in her message \"Ami kicchu korte chai (I want to do something)\" showed the same strong determination. The attached \"God has a bigger plan for me than I have for myself\" is from her facebook wall.And, may I say that I have heard the voice of  Independence?Endnote: Vivekananda said, \"Freedom is the song of the soul.\" To listen to the song of the soul or voice of independence, there may require a no-abandoning voice of care. One such voice was picked up on Saturday in NSS, IIT Kharagpur conducted medical camp (Link). Please listen to it. The conversation may be in Bengali, but the language of love is always understood."},
{"title": "This is where", "date": "Tuesday, August 19, 2014", "text": "\"This is the day when it began. This is where it all began.\" We heard Director, IIT Kharagpur starting his Foundation Day speech this way yesterday. Before proceeding further, let me acknowledge that this post is  going to be a highly 'plagiarized' one :-) with many copy - paste material. The reason - the more I write myself, the more I'll dilute the original. And, hence.We had Independence Day celebration and Foundation Day celebration in a space of four days. On Independence Day, the unfurling of National Flag was followed by Independence Day speech. Let me quote a part of it.On this auspicious occasion, we pay our respectful homage to our countrymen who sacrificed their lives and earned this freedom. The freedom thus earned, is the job completely done? Should we then sit complacent with this or look ahead? I understand that what we have is only physical freedom and what we should be aiming is internal and spiritual freedom as well.  One may gain political and social independence, but if one is slave to his passions and desires, one cannot feel the pure joy of real freedom. Our aim now should be to move towards this real freedom.Everything that we perceive around us is struggling towards freedom. When the line of action taken is not proper one, we call it evil; and when the manifestation of its proper and high, we call it good. But the impulse is the same, the struggle towards freedom. The saint is oppressed with the knowledge of his condition of bondage, and he wants to get rid of it; so he worships God. The thief is oppressed with the idea that he does not possess certain things, and he tries to get rid of that want, to obtain freedom from it; so he steals. The freedom which the saint seeks is very different from that which the robber seeks; the freedom loved by the saint leads him to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeakable bliss, while that on which the robber has set his heart only forges other bonds for his soul.  A video of this speech is available in the video player below. Full text of the speech can be found here (Link). This reminds me a Vivekananda quote, \"Bold words and bolder deeds are what we want. Awake, awake, great ones! The world is burning with misery. Can you sleep? Let us call and call till the sleeping gods awake, till the God within answers to the call. What more is in life? What greater work?\"And don't we take this pledge here every year on 15th August morning (Link)?In this solemn morning, when our people by their suffering and sacrifice, have secured freedom and become masters of their destiny, we do dedicate ourselves to the service and welfare of India, to the end that this ancient land attain its rightful and honored place in the world, and makes its full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and welfare of mankind. May we have the strength to hold high the banner that has been entrusted to us, and the devotion to serve till the last breath, the cause that it represents.Comes the Foundation Day, 18th August. We hear the announcement, \"In a first, IIT Kharagpur, the oldest among all IITs, will have a centre exclusively for promotion of human values through meditation, yoga, lectures on spiritualism and character building. To be named after Swami Vivekanand, the centre will aim to combine modern education with development of the personality.\"To be named after Swami Vivekanand, the centre will aim to combine modern education with development of the personality - See more at: http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-iit-kgp-to-boast-of-a-centre-for-promotion-of-human-values/article1-1253591.aspx#sthash.ynBvXP3L.jaN9jFOL.dpufDirector, IIT Kharagpur's message had been:Vivekananda is the ideal of the youth. Hence the centre is being named after him to honour him and inculcate his teachings among the youth. There is a need for leadership and human excellence in addition to regular academic curricula,Dean, Alumni Affairs and Internal Relations, IIT Kharagpur had this to say.Swami Vivekanand had proposed the right mix of modern education drawn from the best western ideals with the goal of total development of human personality as envisioned by eastern sages. The centre would be a sanctuary for the soul. It will be located in the middle of a lake with a pristine environment. We hope to start construction in a few months and the centre may be complete by the end of next year.Exciting days ahead! And the other student group (known as TTG here) with whom I have now the privilege to work, are making it even more exciting with the launch of this blog on the Foundation Day (Link).Through the vision and efforts of its patrons and members, TTG aspiresto play its role humbly while IIT Kharagpur reaches greater heights in R & D space and on this auspicious day, TTG dedicates  itself once again at the service of our beloved alma mater."},
{"title": "A Pilgrimage", "date": "Sunday, August 3, 2014", "text": "This is a visual walk through of a pilgrimage that we undertook yesterday (02-08-2014). The offering asked from us by the deity for her less privileged children was not money but technology. This post has about 100 pictures and 5 videos (Muktir Mandir, Shrinwantu Bishwe, Writing - Raghu, Play Time and The Need).There was a letter to Director, IIT Kharagpur in this regard from Vivekananda Mission Asram (VMA), Chaitanyapur, Purba Medinipur. A team led by Swami Biswanathananda (Link) and Dr. Subhra Sil visited us at HoD's room, Dept. of Electronics & ECE on 17th July and discussed about development of low vision aid equipment. On 18th July itself, VMA was ready with their invitation for this visit (attached). An announcement in the class of my 3rd year students, a teaser problem, and two students took up the challenge. One of their solution was appreciated by doctors of VMA in this reciprocal visit (not in these pictures due to IP issue).But VMA is more than an eye hospital. It is one of the two centres in this state catering to / guiding the activities around blind / low vision people in the entire state. It has 10 districts under its fold, the farthest is Kuchbihar. The 16 strong doctor team is led by Dr. Asim Kumar Sil and Dr. Subhra Sil who are with the hospital for last 19 years. There are 175 paramedics. The foot-fall in OPD is 400 per day in average. There are 60 paying bed and 40 free beds. Overall, 60 percent of the patients need to be served free. Interestingly, the rest 40 percent can take care of the recurring cost like salary, consumables etc. The self-sufficient model is evident in others spheres too as will be seen in the pictures. The donation, grant are used for addition of infrastructure, expansion to serve more people. More than the medical support, VMA has to work on the heart and mind of low vision people who are often considered as burden and are abandoned by the society. Vivek Maharaj and other volunteers explained how VMA tries to make them self-sufficient in terms of regular day-living as well as financially. It is a true modern day pilgrimage to visit this place.We, four faculty members and two students in the team, were sweetly surprised to meet the first President Gold Medal (PGM) winner of IIT Kharagpur, Shri Bhim Chandra Mandal (1951 - 1954, Mechanical) there. He is associated with VMA and accompanied us the full day.From IITKGP Campus to VMA:The Reception:Start of Campus Tour:The music class (has two videos):The computer class (has one video):The play time (has a very touchy video): Teacher training:The Braille system and the printing machine:We also had lunch :-)Being Self-sufficient (blind / low-vision people are trained to make candle, spices, note-book, file, clothes,  towels, incense-sticks etc. and all these products are in great demand due to quality that is delivered at a very reasonable price point to win tender by competitions):Rehabilitation centre (7 different types of road, 3 types of entry to pond, how to board a boat and many other daily-living skills) :Invoking the spirit (we asked the teachers what makes them reach their superior self to dedicate themselves at the service of the needy):And the other offering (famous eye hospital , has one video where doctors explain the need):Farewell (when we were leaving, at about 7:00 PM):Local media (ETV, Bartamanpatrika and Aajkaal of 03-08-2014):"},
{"title": "Extra", "date": "Friday, July 18, 2014", "text": "We were traveling in one part of the country. We never found gentler people in any other part of the country. They were always 10 on 10 about manners and the way they treated guests like us. However, there was one practice there that we had been told in advance.After paying the cost of the service offered, there is a practice of giving some extra as bakhshish, however small that amount could be and they never argue with that. For that little extra they bow to the customer with a smile in face, offers a salute.Who does not like extra? And it is time for me to take a bow with a smile in face and offer my salute - the charge is handed over yesterday, the 'extra' academic engagement that lasted for last six years comes to an official end. Thanks to all giving me this opportunity. It had been a long association - first as NSS Program Officer, then as NSS Program Coordinator and finally as NSO Health and Fitness Program Coordinator. I thankfully acknowledge the cooperation received from larger campus community, local people, alumni and last but not the least - the beloved student community who I used to interact with, about 1000 of them in each semester. But for the huge goodwill shown by the students, it would not have been possible to undertake the journey over such a long period and together. A quick flashback shows that my first post on NSS was dated 30-08-2008 on this blog (Link) on my first day experience. Earlier I got acquainted with the undercurrent of social entrepreneurship of IIT Kharagpur by attending a student meet here in March, 2008 (Link). The NSS unit I served was named 'Team Vivek' (Vivek comes close to Conscience). The student members came up with a beautiful website on a free server and regularly updated it (Link). It is still live. Then a UG student here, now a researcher at University of Waterloo redirects traffic if any web search leads to him as member of that webteam. I had NCC as EAA in IITKGP during my student days here. NSS was a whole new experience. The little effort the team put caught attention of student community. Scholars' Avenue, the campus newspaper run by the students came up with an article in Oct., 2009 (Link).  The NSS Camp of 2008 was important as it gave lots of confidence and showed the latent strength of NSS team. That was the first time I was communicating beyond my unit and to students of other units. The camp feedback was great. Some of them can be found here (Link).There was no looking back since then. NSS Program Coordinator responsibility came in July, 2010 (Link). Senior students came with donations for instituting scholarships for village school children (Link). And NSS, IIT Kharagpur found a place for itself in in the front page of IITKGP website in the NSS Day 2010 function (Link, Archive). To have easy updates on our activity, we launched NSS Blog in March, 2011 (Link). NSS newsletter was also launched to have higher impact (Link). By 2013, NSS, IIT Kharagpur was ready with committed and experienced faculty and student team. The maturity of its exercises, the visibility made students confident to mention their association with NSS in their resume. This year in Gymkhana election Soap Box, I heard one G Sec. aspirant mentioning the engagement in NSS activities as one of the credential and it is interesting that candidate got the highest vote. The baton was passed to new Program Coordinator of NSS in July 2013 (Link).There was a requirement and thought that may be I can give sometime to another EAA program that was asking attention. It had about 900 students enrolled and there was a great opportunity to serve. Started building team and motivating ourselves (Link). The program was launched in Feb., 2013 and was a success from Day 1 (Link). The journey in that program is captured there in regular session-wise updates. It took some effort from me to be consistent on that front but it had a great effect in launching a big program with so many students being addressed together. Without fail, a mail used to reach every student every TUE and FRI motivating them for the WED and SAT early morning field activity. There were many special activities. Students came up with newsletter for this program too (Link). Comes July 2014 and the new academic session. It is time to hand over the charge to next in command in this EAA program and post the last one here (Link). Is it time to revel in the joyful and satisfying experience of this EXTRA academic journey? There was a Scholars' Avenue article in March 2013 (Link). The title chosen by the students showed why they are our greatest teachers - and what we think as extra is essentially the core of our existence."},
{"title": "Epic", "date": "Sunday, July 6, 2014", "text": "[Pictures are from yesterday evening's visit to Rathayatra fair, just outside IIT Kharagpur campus.]We cannot be faulted if we take ourselves too seriously! After all, this is the only life we have!! One suggestion would be to follow Dadi of Kapil Sharma's popular comedy show on TV. When told, \"Dadi, think second time,\" she shot back,\"When life is one, why think twice?\" For the believers of more than one life, one may say that we had chance before, we shall get chance again - why worry? If nothing works, we have the liberty to become more philosophical than usual - Many like us had come and gone, many like us will come and go, let us not get stressed!!!Star Plus is now beaming the epic Mahabharata with new castings. \"Dharme cha arthe cha kaame cha mokshe cha bharatarshabha. Yadhihasti tadanyatra yannehasti na tadkvachit\" i.e. \"O scion of the Bharat race, whatever dharma, artha, kaam and moksha exists in the world, exists in the text, whatever is not in the text does not exist elsewhere.\" We can watch all episodes here (Link) and take life easy. Of course, we should avoid 'what-if's and draw conclusion out of it. For example, if the battle of Kurukshetra could be avoided if Dhritarashrta dealt Duryodhana differently at various stages - Dhritarashrta could become neither a true king nor a true father. Probably if one is true in one, he automatically becomes true in other.The other epic Ramayana of Ramanand Sagar production, probably holds world record as the most viewed mythological TV serial. Our young days had \"Sitaram charit ati pavan / Madhur saras aur ati mann bhavan / Puni puni kitane ho sune sunae / Phir bhi pyaas bujat na bujae\" filling the air on Sunday mornings.  All episodes of it can be seen here (Link). This too offers lessons that places eternity over transients. Often it is laced with humour that we can appreciate if we know that life is more than stand-up comedy, but comedy it is!! Here goes one such story from Ramayana that is taken from this place (Link). One day in the forest, Lord Rama was standing with his bow rested on the ground and talking to his brother Lord Lakshmana. After some time Lakshmana noticed that Rama’s bow was rested on a frog and it was struggling to survive. Rama took the frog and asked, “Why didn’t you speak up when you were in pain?”. Frog, a self-realized soul, replied “when others hurt me, I call your name “Rama, Rama” – but here it is you giving me the pain – who else can I call? So I accepted this pain as a blessing.”Endnote: \"We play our parts here — good or bad. When the dream is finished and we have left the stage, we will have a hearty laugh at all this — of this only I am sure.\" - Vivekananda in his letter to Sister Nibedita on 28th August, 1900 (Link)"},

{"title": "Senior There, Junior Here", "date": "Thursday, May 22, 2014", "text": "135 likes, 54 comments and still counting, from fellow campusites of IIT Kharagpur and within 14 hrs. of the facebook post of a student here. There is something special in it! Could not help re-sharing in my wall. Few weeks before received the following message from a student who graduated from this place and is now doing PhD in a top US school. This is from a senior to juniors with love. Feeling proud of the feat and the sense of responsibility, maturity shown by our dear students. Hope, this will make way for the manifestation of our inner strength to its fullest by unlocking of our true potential, and we shall see flowers bloom here, there and everywhere! Dear friends,Its been almost a year since I started with my PhD in ECE at one of the top 5 schools in US. Over this period, I have met fellow graduate students from all over the world which includes people who have done their B.S. from MIT, Princeton, Cornell and Tshinghua. I also went through 5 years of kgp life, being in awe of these universities and the kind of courses they have access to. More often than not, I used to feel kind of inferior when applying to grad schools for my PhD when I looked at undergraduates from the above mentioned schools. But from my interactions with people over here, I got to know somethings which surprised me to the core and I am sure will surprise you all as well.I will start this with my first day here, when I met this guy who was going to be an office mate of mine and also my group mate, who did his UG from MIT and he specifically wanted to know which IIT I was from and believe it or not he could spell out Kharagpur. The same happens most of the times when I meet any person for the first time inside the university campus. Most students around here have very high regards for IIT's in general and a lot of it comes from their knowledge of JEE. This is something which might make you feel good, but as you would know sometimes truth is very different from hearsay.Coming to the education system and my first day of classes here, the instructor specifically asked in a graduate class as to how many people in the class were familiar with matrix algebra and linear algebra. I was surprised because I could see only 5 hands raised in a class of 50. You wouldn't really expect this in a graduate class given that it was a class of PhD students from ECE/MechE/ChemE. After the class that day, I had a discussion with my group mates who are from the above mentioned schools about undergraduate curriculums. They have complete freedom right from 1st year so as to choose what courses they want to take unlike us. So, if you pick a student who is interested in VLSI from one of these schools, he/she won't has very little knowledge about Signal Processing/Communications and vice versa. Even I went through periods of frustration when I had to spend hours working on Cadence for doing the layout of some circuits and that too a full custom layout, because it was not my primary field of interest. But at the end I do realize that at the undergraduate levels breadth of the knowledge does help you a lot in the future. Research these days is extremely inter-disciplinary, and many a time ideas from other fields can do wonders in yours. The number of courses we had to take, and that too from various areas amazes my friends here. In a semester taking 5 theory courses and 3 labs here is next to impossible. The classroom environment is very different here. There's absolutely no attendance. You would be thinking, I am going to rant about the classroom environment we have in kgp. Let me go on and tell you some more about the environment here. You can come in and leave the class anytime you want. You can keep working on your laptop right throughout the class. You have complete freedom inside the class. But I have realized after 4 courses here, you get to learn the most from assignments. The assignments are mostly tougher than midterms and endterms. More importantly, you would have to spend a lot of time on these assignments which means you are always up to date with the content being covered in the class. So before midterms/endterms its not a mad rush to find out what was taught and what was not. Added to that, you can't copy assignments from anybody else because if you are found to be involved in plagiarism, you are probably going to be expelled from the university. Now just think of the number of times, we do assignments by ourselves in kgp? The classroom teaching levels are more or less the same here. So what's the only thing which separates us from them? Its just assignments and nothing else. If you do your assignments sincerely, it would be more than enough to keep you in a very good position as far as the course is concerned.I will also give you a reason, why you would hardly find anybody skipping classes here, which everyone of us does every now and then in kgp. Education in general is really expensive in the US. Semester fees run upto tens of thousands of dollars. So leaving out the extremely brilliant and extremely rich, most people are neck deep in loans and have to work their way through school. When I say they work their way through, they do part time jobs which include being a waiter, a bartender or something which you would never want to be. So apart from managing their schedules perfectly, people here won't miss a single class and try to get the most out of the school for every dollar they paid as tuition.So, my friends don't look down at the education you get at kgp. I know there's always room for improvement, but given all the constraints we have we do get top notch undergraduate education. So, next time you think of comparing yourself to somebody from MIT or Princeton, have confidence in yourself. Having said that, don't forget to do justice in every possible way to make the most of the courses you take and before blaming any course instructor for not being able to induce an interest in that particular course, just ask yourself how much effort have you yourself put in for that. I hope to see you all to continue to fly the KGP flag high in India and the world. All the best to you!! Best Regards A senior"},
{"title": "Dhiman Sir", "date": "Monday, April 28, 2014", "text": "Yesterday evening there was an address by Dr. Srikumar Banerjee, Chairman, Board of Governors, IIT Kharagpur. He recollected his IITKGP days, strength of IITKGP and how we can leverage upon our unique attributes. He also explained how some of our perceived weaknesses can be converted to strength with right positioning. Our semi-rural background is considered as weakness. Getting a job for spouse is perhaps easier in a metro. The other perceived weakness is coaching of kids. Dr. Banerjee reminded the faculty that a teacher is not himself/herself, because a teacher touches lives of hundreds, thousands students and thus attitude of a teacher is very important.While I was listening to Dr. Banerjee and taking down notes for the student in me, there was a quick replay in mind of what happened in the morning -my daughter of Class VII coming out of school crying, many other students also crying.... Took daughter to hospital but by that time the carriage has moved away. At home she told her mother that her dream of becoming an 'art teacher' has been shattered. No other teacher can be the substitute. He was so loving - never scolded, always encouraged and inspired students.In a massive heart attack in the school premises itself, everybody's beloved Dhiman Sir passed away yesterday morning in his forties. A big shock for all of us. May his soul rest in peace and his family and students who were so close to him, get the strength to overcome this. Hope that as a faculty I can live up to the expectation of our Chairman; closer home, Dhiman Sir had been an example of that. May we be able to serve our students as nicely as he used to be.His facebook page is this (Link). The latest post there from his daughter says following.what to say and what to write i dont know...today i had lost almost everything...ok ok let me introduce myself I am Pritha Paul daughter of Late Dhiman Paul..I know that this \"Late\" word is inappropriate to use before this name...my dad was everything for me...

{"title": "This far", "date": "Sunday, April 13, 2014", "text": "This far, and no further. Where, when and how we draw the line is very important. We need to be at our wit's end if we allow things to go out of proportion. Timing is important as a stitch in time, saves nine. All these sound good. Comes the most important and difficult question, how do we do it. Do we act tough? Do we act soft? Do we not act at all expecting things to fall back on its own weight? There is no one shoe that fits all. Bead StringThe clock strikes 5:00 AM. Waking up and taking morning walk. Beautiful campus, morning breeze. The loudspeaker of a neighbourhood colony gently pouring in \"Om Bhurbhuba Swaha ..\" You reflect on the past. You gear up for future. You know that yours is to act, to play your character, as long as you are on stage. Many people acted in past, many will come in future. You are only one of the beads in bead string. See that your bead remains shining. Pray, the string that connects all the beads finds mine worthy enough to put on Her necklace. An Inspiring SpeechWe got more than what we could give in terms of our service to village school children when we listened to one youngster from Gholgharia Primary School in NSS, IIT Kharagpur Annual Day on April 12, 2014 (video link). Even if you do not know Bengali, you may feel like listening to it again and again. His audience was a full house V2 auditorium that included students, faculty, Dean, Director of IIT Kharagpur. He took up anecdotes from life of Vivekenanda where his mother Smt. Bhubaneswari Devi and Guru, Sri Ramakrishna taught him adherence to Truth and - it is Truth that conquers.Reaching OutDirector, IIT Kharagpur in his speech emphasized on learning experience of an IITians when (s)he goes through program like NSS (video link). Many students for the first time in their life visit a mud house in a village. It surprises how a two-storied mud house gets built and how it survives. He recollected his own NSS Days as student here. He used to visit Balarampur village to teach underprivileged students. Those students often used to come to campus to clarify their doubts. He encouraged NSS team to come up with more programs for the welfare of underprivileged and reiterated institute's commitment to contribute to the development of villages in 20KM radius of IIT Kharagpur campus. A cultural program by village school students followed (video link).Chandrasekhar Yadala Memorial ScholarshipThis scholarship is in memory of our departed student Chandrasekhar who died of cardiac arrest soon after leaving his MTech program and joining job. This scholarship is funded by faculty and fellow students of his laboratory at IIT Kharagpur. It was bolt from a blue to all those who knew Chandrasekhar, a very jovial and warm person, good at extra-curriculars too. The NSS function saw the award of late Chandrasekhar Yadala Memorial Scholarship to six high school students of neighboring villages of IIT Kharagpur (video link). There was a slide show where we remembered beautiful moments of Chandrasekhar's stay here.Candle MarchThere was also a candle march scheduled on 12th April and it started from Gymkhana later in the evening. It was the last event of the 'Reach Out Week' (April 09-12) and was in memory of two departing souls, who we lost recently. It was a silent procession with candles in hand. The evening was quite windy. People reached out to each other to keep the respective flame burning during the march, whenever it was getting extinguished due to wind (video link). One of the student who I took help from most of the times, was a wing-mate of one of those two boys. There was no apparent reason - he was good in academics, sports and games; probably it was due to overpowering emotion - he was a sensitive boy. The SubstrateI saw the poster in Students Welfare Group's facebook page that says, \"Never make permanent decisions on temporary feelings.\" During our walk, we discussed what I wrote in earlier posts - the amount of effort we give to gain control of external world and not a fraction of it for control over internal world. There is knowledge abound on this in this country. We need to take some amount of our attention away from single-minded pursuit of material wealth and glory and build the aadhar, the substrate - that is me. Else, where will we put all those medals? Also, it will help us to know which are the medals to go after.TaekwondoDoes talking about inner development sound out-of-fashion? Does it sound like prabachan (sermon) which is not meant for youngsters? Well, how about martial art? That probably is fashionable! And one would not feel shy or ashamed to take lesson on that! The other day I was going through basic tenet of Korean martial art Taekwondo (Link). They are: Courtesy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self-control, Indomitable spirit, Community service, Love. We got to acquire these character qualities.Making ChoicesEach of us is a leader. Someone or the other always looks up to me. We need to know how to lead. It first starts with how to lead oneself. There is no choice but to make choices on what we take as input, what we cultivate within and what we place before others. We have to make choices on our input - the company we keep, the material we go through. We have to make choices on what to cultivate, of various inputs that we receive. Finally, we have to see if what we give back to society, has gone through a value addition, if we are contributing to the making of a better society, and a better tomorrow. It starts from self. Then if we get an organizational responsibility, there too we have to make choices. There is no escape from it. But we always have to ask ourselves, our conscience this question - what are we trying to achieve by making this choice.EndnoteEvery action has a reaction. A leader has the strength and ability, will and resolve to withstand it. It is easier if sufficient contemplation is done, if the decision is for the greater good. To lead is to sacrifice. Sacrifice gives moral strength to the leader, earns him / her respect. That is the real power. Rest is only supplementary. We have to sacrifice many of our smaller propensities to lead ourselves to our greater selves. We should not be afraid of sacrifice. Let me end with a famous quote of Vivekananda, \"Sacrifice in the past has been the Law, it will be, alas, for ages to come. The earth’s bravest and best will have to sacrifice themselves for the good of many, for the welfare of all.\""},
{"title": "Reaching Out", "date": "Sunday, April 6, 2014", "text": "It was last Monday. The fish-sellers in the market complex were too talking about this, bereaved. Two such incidents within a fortnight! Went to institute. Teaching, non-teaching staffs alike were expressing their pain. And as we expect to hear from elders, were wondering if these students at least thought about what their family members back home would go through. It was also being discussed what we can do more, in addition to services already in place. Director, IIT Kharagpur in his message to students requested all students in reaching out to each other. In his message to teaching and non-teaching staffs, he requested their time, cooperation, guidance to students.Next day, I had a double lecture in my 'Signals and Systems' course of 100 UG students. We are near the end of the semester. After learning the methods and techniques of characterizing analog and digital signals and systems (emphasis was more on digital part in this course  - while students get educated I get re-educated), it was time to take up challenges / practical issues in building up of systems. We took up physiological system as an example. The attached three slides give an outline of the discussion.It was not surprising that the discussion at times drew certain analogy where our social being and society came as a system that reacts to various kind of stimuli or signals. At times, response and its effect need to be fast but at other time, the effect takes more time to be visible on surface but it is more permanent in nature. We discussed the difference between symptom and sign and how to get more of objective data to initiate action. Rarely any disease, even in societal space, is silent. Often it remains buried under noise. Signal-to-Noise ratio can be improved if we can get close to the source of the signal. Will getting too close to be seen as invasion of privacy?The Student Welfare Group (SWG - Link) representative from this class met me at the end of the class. We discussed many things - the role of SWG wing representative in hostel, role of friends, family, and faculty members like us. In a closed campus like us, far from maddening crowd of a metro city, there can be closer interaction between students and faculty. And we are always within the reach of the students and they are always welcome.Three years back when such an unfortunate incident took place, I tried to conjure my thoughts and assemble them in this post (Link).If I am to express my thoughts today on this, the following is what I would like to put forward.Each of us respond to signals / triggers based on what we pick up - the tuned receiver as we are, our processing ability and the way we have trained ourselves to develop a model of life before us. We, specially the privileged ones, often tend to believe in a made-to-order life where perhaps, our entitlement is the only things that matter.Made-to-order life? Devoid of uncertainties? It does not require a big philosophical debate to understand that the same is only a wishful thinking and against fundamental tenet of life. Yes, many of the signals / triggers of life can be anticipated within certain range of error, even there the errors which essentially are perpendiculars to thought processes, need to be adequately dealt. And there is always a probability of signals / triggers for which error is out of range. Whether we like or not, we cannot avoid challenges of life - predictable, not-so-predictable. That there will be uncertainties of various orders is certain, for each one of us.How do we deal with it?In one approach, I can expect that the sources that cause error in my life's model adjusting itself in such a way so that my life's challenges are reduced. The environment that sends signal / trigger / challenges to me is not static. It is also changing and responding to various triggers at its own level as a macro system.In another approach, I do what Tagore taught us in a poem meant for rapid-reading of children but has profound thoughts embedded in it. He used his own brand of humor to teach us life's lessons. A translation of original Bengali poem appears here (Link). Speaking Tree puts it under category 'self-improvement' and gives a nice narration here (Link). This says that it is not possible to swipe the dust off the entire earth and it is far more practicable proposition to cover our own feet.As an individual, it helps me to weather all challenges in every environment if I grow in character and build inner strength, not being at the mercy of the environment around. I can expect to have an environment that I think is congenial for me and everybody, here and everywhere. But what if it does not exactly matches my expectation? Is it not prudent if I also take up an exercise to emerge stronger mentally, physically - in all three components of 'H' - Heart, Head, Hand? Heart - to feel, Head - to think and plan, Hand - to execute.How do we do that? How do we grow strong inside? How do we emerge as a better and stronger individual to cope up challenges of life?Since early childhood, we spend so much time and energy to learn a thing or two of external world, how to make things move there. We often do not give even a small fraction of that time, energy to myself to understand me in relation to the society, how we can build our character, what makes our inner world move.What are the methods of techniques to develop character strength? There are enough as knowledge pool. We simply need to make a conscious effort after recognizing the fact that we need to grow within. If required, I can come up with another post in future on what I can share from a learner's point of view (not as teacher).All said and done, if we do not start our training early enough, after certain age \"Training is taken and not given.\" This I heard from Sri Russi Modi, MD of Tata Steel when I joined that organization at the completion of my B.Tech. here."},
{"title": "Thank you, again", "date": "Monday, March 17, 2014", "text": "It was Friday, last Friday.And it was more than not getting time to trace the misplaced bank pass book and cheque book and pleading for a bearer cheque from issuer. Had to do that twice last week as was not getting even 2-3 hours of time for myself. Yes, that is the estimated time for me to trace a misplaced article, if I am lucky enough!There was a list of works-to-do in my hand where I am to serve others in various capacities. Started with tracks which are well-known to me and treaded before, to move to more difficult terrain later. Updated NSS, IIT Kharagpur blog reporting the activity of our student-conducted Thalassemia detection camp (Link). Then updated NSO Health and Fitness blog with activity pic.s of previous three sessions (Link).On roll and concentration in place, started the more difficult one of the work. In this, I had to get deeper into twenty-seven high stake activities of our researchers and their collaborators and prepare for a Saturday meeting at Kolkata.There was a one hour meeting at 12 noon with a guest from abroad. There was another important meeting in the Dept. in the afternoon. And I might get a call for preparation on it. What to do? Sent a mail to ever-indulging faculty colleagues that it is one of those days for me when I feel like putting up a 'Do-Not-Disturb' noticeboard.But phone call came. At about 11 AM. From senior faculty of the Dept. My first sentence, even before hearing anything, was a cry - \"Cannot go. On a very important, time-critical work. Please.\" But I was told, \"You have to come, there is no choice.\"And I understood.Thank you. Thank you all, once again. Though I was hearing it for sometime in sidelines and there was unofficial congratulations too, this was the official letter.But had no time to celebrate or give quality response to congratulatory messages. Completed official formalities in 15 minutes. In a quick stop-over at lab., told research students that it is for their hard work. Said the same to my first PhD student replying his mail.Told mother. She was happy but no apparent exuberance as had always been the case for my parents. What is more important is what you see of yourself and how best you perform your service. Recognition is welcome but not something to get swayed by that (Link).Her Highness and daughter are taking inter academic-year break and are away at in-law's place. None perhaps has the courage enough to put a timer in a conversation with the better half. But they have the ability. May be the modulation in voice, the height and spread of the words uttered, give a clue. Came a rebuff. It is not necessary to call as routine stuff. Please call when you have time, even if it means after 2-3 days! It always helps to plead guilty before a forgiving Her Highness and it worked again. She said that she would talk at length after Saturday meeting.Previous Friday received an invitation card for International Women's Day event. Was involved in some way with it as women from neighbourhood villages were to participate. Gave the card to Her Highness and said that there would be speakers like Smt. Alakananda Roy, Mata Divyapremanandaprana, Smt. Bharati Ghosh etc. and if she would like to attend. Came a prompt reply. Would go if the organizing committee put up a grievance cell - to report how less time we give at home and how much we remain occupied with institute activity!!!Back to this Friday and back to work again. The 1 hour meeting at 12 noon got little extended. We had heart to heart and effective discussion. On collaboration, told what my good friend and collaborator at University of London advised long back. Successful Collboration needs three 'C' - Complementarity, Capability, Confidence. Just because another person is doing similar work may not be enough. Everyone liked this straight talking.Outside meeting room, met IIT Kharagpur batchmate, now faculty of a different dept. Hearing this, he smilingly said, \"When were you not blunt like this?\" Even then people bear with me and that shows how lucky I had been to be surrounded by quality people. Thank you all!Quick 10 minute lunch. Resumed the work in the solitude of my 2nd office, away from Dept. The clock goes past 4:30 PM. Phone call comes from Dept. Meeting has to start. I was asked to take a note of the proceedings as the faculty responsible for it was on leave. Saved the work till that time and proceeded.Entered the Dept. and its meeting room burdened with a big sense of guilt. Heard that mother of one of our Dept. colleague expired in the morning. Other colleagues were to go to his quarter at 3 PM before they move to burning ghat. I planned to join them but could not. As the meeting started, senior faculty informed all present and they congratulated. I do not remember if I expressed my gratitude to all well. Had my attention fixed elsewhere than those congratulations. It was a joint faculty meeting between our Dept. and another school. Shall send a mail to all saying thanks.The meeting was over by 6:15 PM. It was an important meeting. Contributed in my own style (straight forward but inclusive) for which homework was done earlier. A visit to the other office in main building where I usually am there during 6 - 8 PM to address issues there. Four-five students were waiting for me in that office. They are key members of Technology Transfer Group promoting Intellectual Property awareness in the institute.The students wanted to know my evaluation of their work related to Patent Drive that was launched on 12th March, 2014. They really worked hard and also developed an online system for the same that is hosted in the internal server. I started a blog on this yesterday and a post on this drive can be found here (Link).I said that they did an excellent job and the core team members, about 10 of them, with whom I worked closely for last 3 months for this, deserve a treat from me and let us decide the date and venue. To this, the students said, \"Not now, Sir. Let us first achieve the 100 patent target and after that.\" I could not believe! To have such a sense of responsibility shows the maturity and dedication of the team. Hat's off! Thank you, dear, thank you.Left office at 8:30 PM. Asked one of my colleague over phone and learnt that they have returned from burning ghat. Went to the colleague's quarter. Said 'sorry' for being late. As said before, I am lucky to be surrounded by good people who always forgives me.Returned home at 9:15 PM. Mother already started chopping vegetables, a work that is reserved for me every evening in this phase when Her Highness is away. I replaced her and started my work. In earlier such phase, I also cooked. This time with improvement after knee transplant, Mother is at that. At 10 PM, put the loudspeaker, microphone batteries to recharge for next morning's P.T. session for which I had to wake up at 5:15 AM.I had two choices. One was to complete the remaining work of Kolkata meeting next morning, after P.T. session (7 AM) and before departure for Kolkata (9 AM). The other was to finish the work and then go to bed so that there is no uncertainty for tomorrow.Took the right choice, the second one as the work continued up to 1:30 AM. Couldn't have completed next morning.As the central character of the story goes to bed earning his days's rest, we have almost completed the story, story of a day in the life of persons like us. Let me conclude by saying that, sent an email in the evening to someone who always motivated, supported, to say thanks and wished to be worthy of the role in an institute 'dedicated to the service of the nation.'P.S.: If the readers are curious to know how the Saturday went, I would say that it went the way where their best guess would take them to :-) If the readers find this post dull and boring, I would like to add some colour to it by adding a picture - a long 'pahechan kaun' shot where three faculty members of our dept. are on a retreat after a failed attempt of invasion on Holi Day. Not really. They came to our quarter, offered Abir at the feet of my mother and we too exchanged. Thank you, dear!"},
{"title": "Executive-In-Charge", "date": "Monday, February 24, 2014", "text": "It was the 3rd evening of this month. Like every year, this year too, Tata Bearings family extended their invitation to be a part of their annual function where they remember Vivekananda's life and message. I worked in this Bearings Division of Tata Steel, situated about 10 KM from IIT Kharagpur campus, in 1992-1993. One may expect that I was at my unconventional best :-) in those years too! And the love, the affection I still enjoy there even after 20 years, shows the greatness, kindness of people there and people at large which we often underestimate. If I am in station, I do not give this annual function a miss.We had speakers in this evening from Ramakrishna order who spoke nicely and at length. I spoke for few minutes. However, this post is about what Executive-in-Charge of Tata Bearings told in the occasion. He started by seeking forgiveness from the monk for being little late. It was a weekday and he had certain responsibilities. Talking about responsibilities, he said that he can never forget that as head of the organization he has to look after well-being of families of 500 employees. And though he wanted, he could not give as much time to study Vivekanada's works. That he was speaking from the heart and not for the occasion can be found from this youtube video which I dug out later (Link). Here he was taking Economic Times IMEA award and in his acceptance speech we hear him saying, \"The only thing I want to say that my heart goes for my 500 people back in my Kharagpur unit who are my direct employees and another 500 who are indirectly associated with us...and it is all because of them I am here.\"But in this 3rd Feb. function he did not stop just at that. He went on saying that what he takes inspiration from is an anecdote on Dharmabyadha which Vivekananda told in explaining Karmayoga. This he studied in Class VIII and preserves within him. He narrated the anecdote at length which I reproduce below from Vivekananda's works (Link).The other day I was requesting a senior person here who is working tirelessly to take the institute forward, to take care of health and to get adequate sleep. This I tell whenever I find a person is not able to give enough attention to his/her health. As an executive, he/she is key not only for the well-being of the organization but also for contributing to the growth of the nation, its success, fulfilling aspiration of thousands.It is in everybody's interest to see that good people have a good going :-) physically and mentally. In fact, all of us should have a good going so that we can serve to the best of our capacity.--------\"The only way to rise is by doing the duty next to us, and thus gathering strength go on until we reach the highest state. A young Sannyâsin went to a forest; there he meditated, worshipped, and practiced Yoga for a long time. After years of hard work and practice, he was one day sitting under a tree, when some dry leaves fell upon his head. He looked up and saw a crow and a crane fighting on the top of the tree, which made him very angry. He said, \"What! Dare you throw these dry leaves upon my head!\" As with these words he angrily glanced at them, a flash of fire went out of his head — such was the Yogi's power — and burnt the birds to ashes. He was very glad, almost overjoyed at this development of power — he could burn the crow and the crane by a look. After a time he had to go to the town to beg his bread. He went, stood at a door, and said, \"Mother, give me food.\" A voice came from inside the house, \"Wait a little, my son.\" The young man thought, \"You wretched woman, how dare you make me wait! You do not know my power yet.\" While he was thinking thus the voice came again: \"Boy, don't be thinking too much of yourself. Here is neither crow nor crane.\" He was astonished; still he had to wait. At last the woman came, and he fell at her feet and said, \"Mother, how did you know that?\" She said, \"My boy, I do not know your Yoga or your practices. I am a common everyday woman. I made you wait because my husband is ill, and I was nursing him. All my life I have struggled to do my duty. When I was unmarried, I did my duty to my parents; now that I am married, I do my duty to my husband; that is all the Yoga I practice. But by doing my duty I have become illumined; thus I could read your thoughts and know what you had done in the forest. If you want to know something higher than this, go to the market of such and such a town where you will find a Vyâdha (The lowest class of people in India who used to live as hunters and butchers.) who will tell you something that you will be very glad to learn.\" The Sannyasin thought, \"Why should I go to that town and to a Vyadha?\" But after what he had seen, his mind opened a little, so he went. When he came near the town, he found the market and there saw, at a distance, a big fat Vyadha cutting meat with big knives, talking and bargaining with different people. The young man said, \"Lord help me! Is this the man from whom I am going to learn? He is the incarnation of a demon, if he is anything.\" In the meantime this man looked up and said, \"O Swami, did that lady send you here? Take a seat until I have done my business.\" The Sannyasin thought, \"What comes to me here?\" He took his seat; the man went on with his work, and after he had finished he took his money and said to the Sannyasin, \"Come sir, come to my home.\" On reaching home the Vyadha gave him a seat, saying, \"Wait here,\" and went into the house. He then washed his old father and mother, fed them, and did all he could to please them, after which he came to the Sannyasin and said, \"Now, sir, you have come here to see me; what can I do for you?\" The Sannyasin asked him a few questions about soul and about God, and the Vyadha gave him a lecture which forms a part of the Mahâbhârata, called the Vyâdha-Gitâ. It contains one of the highest flights of the Vedanta. When the Vyadha finished his teaching, the Sannyasin felt astonished. He said, \"Why are you in that body? With such knowledge as yours why are you in a Vyadha's body, and doing such filthy, ugly work?\" \"My son,\" replied the Vyadha, \"no duty is ugly, no duty is impure. My birth placed me in these circumstances and environments. In my boyhood I learnt the trade; I am unattached, and I try to do my duty well. I try to do my duty as a householder, and I try to do all I can to make my father and mother happy. I neither know your Yoga, nor have I become a Sannyasin, nor did I go out of the world into a forest; nevertheless, all that you have heard and seen has come to me through the unattached doing of the duty which belongs to my position.\"\""},
{"title": "Overwhelmed", "date": "Wednesday, February 12, 2014", "text": "Got a phone call this morning from one of the driver of the travel agency who often obliges by his service. He asked about my availability to come to our quarter in the campus. He will be coming with his wife to invite our family for his brother-in-law's marriage reception. We had a tussle. Each of us were asking what would be convenient time for other. I was concerned that he makes a living out of his job where he has less control over situation. Finally, we settled for 8:30 PM. I'll be back from office today half-an-hour early!!Feel overwhelmed. The travel agency drivers do tell me that they have a friendly fight among themselves on who will be at driver's wheel when I book a car. Also heard that their family members often tease each other on this - that the other person did not get the chance. May be the drivers find a good listener in me to share their life's happiness and sorrows and like the way I try to encourage them.Yesterday, in the local fish-market, the didi who often sells fish to us was trying to draw my attention to the weighing balance before calculating the payout, as I was occupied with something else. I requested her to go ahead without worrying and told that it is she who would feel bad if I get less than what I deserve. Truly so. Didi appreciated that and was in all smile.Few weeks back I was giving my evaluation report to a young faculty where he has asked for project funding. I said that it goes beyond the project, it is investment in a person. Didn't we hear from Vivekananda, \"Men, men, these are wanted. Everything else will be ready.\" Investment in people and getting the best out of them in every strata of life, by acknowledging their effort, by making them feel responsible that they are important part of the society, contribute to its well-being and there is no room for feeling alienated - are perhaps what takes us to inclusive growth built upon share and care.Yesterday evening we had a small triumph! The small team with whom I work in a new admin. responsibility since mid Oct., 2013 has reached an important milestone. We reached 'zero pending' situation yesterday. It was about 8 PM. Together, we went to the official's place where our files land-up and created hallah :-) there that the official should give us treat! He enjoyed that and told that he too is a part of the team. The greatest part in this journey had been the fact that it was fun all the way, we always enjoyed each others' company and never let work pressure get the better of us.Thank you all in-office and outside-office at IIT Kharagpur for your kind gestures. For you the life is so much enjoyable here. Truly, feel overwhelmed!"},

Building of an Ark was at the centre of the film for which people in general, failed to see any justification. Came a flood along a fault line built on human greed. The Ark was the savior. The movie ends explaining us another meaning of ARK - Act of Random Kindness.Felt so good to read this in today's newspaper. Two tribal brothers, Anil Shabar and Ashok Shabar donate 10 cottah of land for building a school in their village (in district Bankura, about 125 KM from IIT Kharagpur campus). They themselves are daily wage earner. Why did they then do it? They say that their entire life went in abject poverty but they want to see their next generation doing better getting proper education. The BDO was surprised and he said that there was difficulty in getting land there for building school as it came under forest area. For this donation, a school and a training centre will be built.The Shabar brothers consider themselves uneducated! And we look for ARK like this!!"},

{"title": "O Holy Night", "date": "Tuesday, December 24, 2013", "text": "Cannot stop myself from sharing this article which is front-paper news of Kolkata edition of many newspapers today. This is the struggle of Jhuma Sarakar whose father, a small wage earner mason, was sent to life imprisonment by lower court when Jhuma was in Class VII. The devastated family saw the mother start working as domestic help. There was some support from uncle in initial years. Jhuma did not abandon study. Joined college and started giving private tution. With that she started long court battle to prove his father's innocence. Everyone in the family always saw in the father a pious and kind person and was convinced of innocence.In the words of Jhuma, \"My faith in his innocence prompted me to raise money for the legal battle by giving private tuition. My mother works as a domestic help. She brought me up. I had resolved that I would not marry before my father’s innocence was proved.\" (The Telegraph Link) and \"I was a child then. Though I knew that my father was innocent, I couldn't do anything to help. Finally, when I joined college, I decided that we would have to get justice for him. I started giving private coaching and spent whatever I got in providing legal help for my father. My father was in jail for so many years for no fault of his and this was the least we could do to get him out. My uncle provided a lot of assistance.\" (ToI Link)2004 to 2013. A long journey. The day was yesterday, the 24th Decemeber, 2013. The father was released by higher court. The Holy Night descends in Sarkar family with a different meaning all together. The stars salute the grit, the determination of the daughter. We join them and take a bow before the daughter.And this is the country where daughters are seen as burden! We at IIT Kharagpur are exploring means to reduce female foeticide. Hope we can do our part so that Jhumas can continue to prove their worth and the Agnipariksha from Ramayan ages stop someday.Jhuma is now studying M.A. Her brother abandoned study in Class VII."},

We tend to believe that it is not-so-easy a task :-) One may ask, how much did the gift worth? The fact is different. It was a gift that I gave to myself. And that brought the smile. Yes, I took morning walk this morning after a long, long time.There was no short-cut either. It was full 4 KM stretch and in my favourite terrain. When was it the last time? Two months back, or more - lost the count of it. Past few months had been very, very hectic. Added responsibilities. Extra effort to fit into the shoes. Lace tied. I have earned my gift. The morning walk.Another thing changed in between. The fun of being a part of the crowd and in a shooting spree with camera is being replaced with more formal stuffs. It was a smooth ride in crossing 10,000 marks of shooting pics in last 4 years. Most of them were for NSS (Link) and NSO Health and Fitness (Link).I attended this year's NSS Annual camp in bits and pieces because of the new responsibilities - had been camp commandant in last five years. And this forced me to change my facebook friends policy. I started accepting friends request from students after two days of the camp. The students were posting their activities, how they were building murram roads, cleaning bushes etc. in their profile. And I could feel the pulse of the camp through them. All NSS camp pictures in this page are taken from facebook upload of students.I spent longer on the concluding day of the 7-day long camp. The NSS faculty compering the show called me to say a few words. Later I found that another NSS faculty recorded the same and shared that with me. I find that I thanked all, explained the policy change :-) and felt proud that the worry of what would happen when I move to other responsibility was unfounded. Feel so proud of the NSS, IIT Khaargpur team! Told the NSO Health and Fitness team too last week that they are to get ready!!Yesterday, attended an important meeting at Delhi. Watched the movie \"Naram Garam\", and Kabi Sammelan \"Wah! Keya baat Hai\" in the flight. As said, things are under control now! Remember that last week on Friday afternoon while waiting at Fortis hospital, Kolkata for our collaborator to finish heart surgery and begin discussion (and a demonstration of laptop version of heart sound analyzer developed by us), I was checking end-semester answer-scripts much to the bewilderment of people in hospital reception.Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Amol Palekar - you are prepared for a sweet family drama! But Birju the artist gives a test of both art and artist in the following segment (Link) at 3:30 minute onwards. \"Aagar umar ke lehaj se kaha to thik hai ... Kalakar apne Mata, Pita aur Guru ko chhorke kisi ke pao mein haat nehi lagata. Samjhe aap. Namaste.\"The \"Wah! Keya baat Hai\" program in Air India flight had interesting lines. A couplet there asked one to be cautious as \"Ishq o nadi hai jiska kinara nehi.\" Received a mail from a young monk of Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math on Saturday. He says, \"Swamiji mentioned work and worship can be performed in three ways: work and worship, work as worship and work is worship. Our way should be the last one.\"I don't know which part of this story is Ishq, which is work and which is worship or if the fine line melts somewhere when we think less of our own well-being and more of the society around us.End-quote from Vivekananda: \"The whole gist of this teaching is that you should work like a master and not as a slave; work incessantly, but do not do slave's work...Love and do good to everybody, but do not become a slave. In the first place, attachment degenerates us, individually, and in the second place, makes us extremely selfish. \""},

Next destination is Dept. to finish the rest of the work. 8:45 PM - phone call from home. Start winding up slowly. Walk past the corridor, stop a while at a colleague's door. A quick rerun of the day. Did you hear correctly - what is more important, being a high achiever or being a good human being? Do these two have inherent conflict? Vivekananda said, \"Unselfishness is more paying only people do not have the patience to practise it.\" Can we not have both high achiever and a good human being in one? If we are asked to choose between a high achiever and a good human being, the answer should be obvious. But is that so?Every choice has a cost. If we choose good human being and not the high achiever, we miss out association with those achievements and additional scores that come with it. If we do not choose good human being, we are on a slippery ground. Is it a choice for only today or also for tomorrow or day after? One may ask, tomorrow will come only if we are able to survive today. The fact is, whether we survive or not, tomorrow will come. We have to go one day. But tomorrow will continue to come. That is inevitable.There was a facebook post this evening! Excerpts below in italic. Immediately three persons come into chat. All from outside IIT Kharagpur community.

You post a message which is not that obvious and immediately three persons ping you, comfort you. Achievement! What is that? And here is a person who thought that the issue deserves a post! Only a blind person or a blinded person cannot see what is obvious!!Be God's child. You need not fear anything! Fear, according to Vivekananda, is the greatest weakness. He said, \"Stand up, be bold, be strong. Take the whole responsibility on your own shoulders, and know that you are the creator of your own destiny. All the strength and succor you want is within yourselves.\" He further said, \"“Face the brutes.” That is a lesson for all life—face the terrible, face it boldly.

Those who will not be happy with these few lines after getting used to my long posts :-) here is a copy-paste from my facebook \"What's in your mind?\" answer of today - To lead is to sacrifice. Highest leadership, highest sacrifice. Sacrifice gives moral strength to the leader, earns respect. That is the real power. Rest is only supplementary. Let us not miss the bird for the bush. How true is Vivekananda saying we memorized in children's wing of Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal \"Shirdar to sardar, matha dite paro to neta hobe.\" Sacrifice cannot be forced unto oneself. It comes from love. See yourself in the mirror. Look at your eyes. Do you love your people with all their strength and weaknesses? If not, leadership is a torture for yourself as well as for the people you lead. Remember Nabanida saying once that if you do 10 yourself, other may do 1.

{"title": "Inspiring Words", "date": "Sunday, September 29, 2013", "text": "I was a part of the audience this weekend where Padma Vibhushan, Dr. M. S. Valiathan (Link) was delivering his keynote speech. The occasion was PULMOCON - 2013, 11th All India Update in Pulmonary Medicine organized by Institute of Pulmocare & Research (IPCR), Kolkata. We have active research collaboration with IPCR. The invitation card quoted Vivekananda, \"The old religions said that he was an atheist who did not believe in God. The new religion says that he is an atheist who does not believe in himself. \" The conference hall had two large sized Vivekananda pictures in between multimedia projection screens.Dr. Valiathan took us through the history of medicine and medical research in India. It was really 'mesmerizing' as described by one of the two vice-chancellors present there. He talked about lacuna, the disconnect that exist in medical research space. But he did not sound criticizing as such but telling the audience to feel inspired, contribute and be a part of India's growth story. The speech many times referred to Dr. Sambhu Nath De, the discoverer of Cholera toxin, who had nomination for Nobel prize several times but his work remained 'unsung and unnoticed' in India (link).Dr. Valiathan was at ease to quote Upanishad and making his point across. He narrated the story of Nachiketa, the importance and meaning of Shraddha for which 'there is no equivalent word in English dictionary.' He stressed on the need of firm determination, single minded devotion and obligation of privileged community like us to all, that includes future generation.I was sweetly surprized when his speech referred to our work on 'lung acoustics' and he said that such type of work is needed. The development of lung sound analyzer is a collaborative research between our lab. at IIT Kharagpur and IPCR. Felt so, so much proud and inspired! Thank you, Sir. We shall keep trying to the best of our ability.The function felicitated vice chancellor of one university for his contribution to medical research related to medical image processing. Felt proud because he is our Dept. colleague at IIT Kharagpur and is on deputation now. I was overwhelmed to find several medical workers working in remote villages, promoting health and awareness as foot-soldiers, getting felicitated at the function. This is very inspiring.

Attended one Kabi Sammelan (congregation of poets) briefly. The anchor-organizer told why arranging such a sammelan is difficult. He was told by an experienced person that it is like walking of a clay doll along a path which passes through a river. The creative self of Kabi (poet) can throw up surprises with satire on current time, anti-establishment lines or something which may not be palatable for everyone in the audience.Stumbling upon a social networking place where young students converse is not easy either for teachers as it may embarrass. It could be one of those 'Confession' pages of facebook or questions posed in Quora. But it is a good opportunity if he enters those pages as students and not as a teacher, as one who wants to be educated. He may get some feedback for himself which may not be available in usual channel. If it is good, his confidence increases. If not, he should humbly introspect. Of course, he should be able to separate signal from noise. He should not get carried away either way as this social networking space is dominated by certain fraction of the student community having strong likes or dislikes and / or specific traits!Not every teacher may be as lucky :-) to be a part of student conversation, being loved or hated (love me, hate me, but you cannot ignore me :-)) !! In fact, most of them are not. Still if one does not feel uncomfortable with the way young students converse, it is worth going through their experience, the issues that occupy them. And one may be sweetly surprised to see that even if baser stuffs usually purge the space, it is the occasional gems that get most 'like's, the ones that exhibits the higher self of one - the struggle, the sacrifice.Before I paste two such 'Confessions' verbatim here, for which I would also like to say respect _/\\_ like student friends, I remember one lecture of young Ramakrishna Mission monk of a US centre. I first heard it in 2006 during my one semester association with USC. But every time I hear it, it is a humbling experience. The title of the talk is 'Teacher and Student'. I made a youtube version of it with our young students taking the role of teachers in village schools which is available here (Link).---- verbatim from students' public post ----[The following is about the range of difficulties a student can face and how he fights them and emerges as winner. We perhaps do not teach this to students. Rather we are taught by them when we read this aspect of their life.]This one is the best among confessions, i have read till now._/\\_ here it goes:#I see a lot of my juniors confessing about love , sex , make outs, awesum college life. i want to confess something else .1. I joined heritage in its initial batches. i was very introvert and was a ragged a hell lot . A belt was tied around neck i was made to roam around the college in my first day. When i complained to my dad he thrashed me saying that i was a loser and wasting his hard earned money.( he hoped that i was in IIT) I felt liked being raped that day, not by my college seniors but by my dad.2. I got a very low grade in my first semester because i was pressurized by my dad to appear for IIT again. I Got a severe thrashing from him again. my mom somehow rescued me.3. In second semester i mustered up enough courage to propose to my best friend but she rejected me because in her words \"\"she didnt wanted to be ridiculed by her friends \"\". she stopped talking to me after that. I was heart broken as she and my mom were the only people i shared everything with.4.during the 4th semester break , while i was returning home after teaching a student . i got a phone call informing me that my mom had expired. my world came crashing that day. I cried for for days on end and somehow picked myself up as i had no other alternative 5. My attendance fell very low that semester and i was summoned by the principal . when i told him about my mothers death he replied \"I hear this lie everyday .please bring me the death certificate if u have one.\" Then while i was leaving he told me \"no need to bring death certificate , useless guys like u can even fake that .call your dad\"6. my frnds always ridiculed me because i was loser .i dint laugh at their jokes .to mix with them i started drinking .i dint like the taste but liked the high . i often used to act drunk to appear more cool. i learned to call girls \"magi \"\" but never knew its real meaning . that helped me survive college 7. it was the campussing day , i got rejected that day again .hoped to make it to the next company. but was unsucessfull till the and of campussing . i had tried a lot . attended English speaking classes (my English was horrible) , brought new pair of shirt . when my dad heard this he told me not to call again and this time i didnt feel remorse or regret for him . for the ntire night i contemplated suicide but couldn't as i had promised my mom that i will shine one day .8 . i started doing private tutiions and preparing for CAT. i gave my everything. I got 99.87 percentile but couldnt make it again to a big IIM because of my low grades. What had i done now to deserve this ? i felt. I finally got admitted into decent college and a helpful bank manger arranged for loan .9.After passing out i got into volvo eicher as a junior manager . i dint last for 3 months because i couldnt lick my boss s boot properly .My service was terminated because of being inefficient .10. i started making iPhone apps in my leisure time while i was applying to a few companies . Slowly i took it up as a more serious start up. got hold of 2 more friends like me who were from cs background and were unable to find a job .11. in 2011 i made a small office. by the end of 2011 i had a small group of 8 engineers working with me. In 2012 we bagged several contracts from companies like mobiquity, exxon mobile and the workforce increased to 80 developers. In march 2013 i will be applying for turnover of over 5 crores .I dont know how to thank god for his blessings . i thank that senior who ragged me in my first day at college, that girl who dumped me , my professors who ridiculed me, the numerous friend who though i was a loser . it is you who gave me the courage , the fire , the anger to succeed against all odds . seriously no hard feelings guys , u made me what i am. i dont stay with my dad but i send him enough so that he can lead a comfortable life .My advise to all juniors. shine in life .When a loser like me can why cant u? never let people say u cant do it . many people might have faced similar or more lows in college life but NEVER EVER give up. Let not a broken relationship , failed grade,lost job opportunity or \"status\" among friends define you . And never lose faith in humanity in goodness. there are few bad people but there are a lot more good people around here . I met a lot of good people,professo­rs in my college .and believe me heritage taught me a lot Lastly MA, hope u could read this. I love u a lot.[This is about how much sacrifice a young student can make, beyond the manual of a teacher like us.]If you are one to go by likes, as of now, in 24 hours, this got 21000+ likes!#884 24th may 2013 was the day which changed my views about life... my room mate at iit had fallen in love in the 3rd year of our college to one of the most chirpy, flamboyant girl of our batch. i had no particular reservations for their relationship other than the fact that they were quite opposites my buddy was shy, intro and she altogether was different and i actually felt that she did not love my friend as much as he did. actually becoz of her nature i thought she took their relationship very lightly. but whatever be my notion both got along well then i got placed in the usa and left while my friend got placed in an mnc in india . we kept in touch for a few months but like it happens usually we got busy in our lives and could not interact much. i took my parents to usa and my links with india got completely cut. now 9 years later i am on an business trip to india i thot of meeting my college friends and contacted many thru fb and likewise. i tried contacting my roomie but met with no responses.when 7, 8 of us met i got this news that my roomie died 5 years ago in the delhi blast at karol bagh. i was shocked and cudnt sink in the fact he was his parents only son and that troubled me more about how those people wud be surviving. so i took his address and went to meet them. when i entered the place(a simple yet utterly beautiful one) i found a group of four 2 old men and 2 old women were having their evening snacks and were smiling, laughing and talking i went on and introduced myself to them they all greeted me with a lot of love and asked me to join in and served me some tea. i took it and was left with no words on how to ask them about how things have been over the years. so i decided to leave and as i was about to rise the gates opened and my friend's gf entered (i thot so these two finally married). she was surprised to see me and welcomed me and asked me to stay over the dinner. after a lot of pestering i agreed and later mustering a lot of courage i asked her so how's life ? to which she smiled and replied good. after a moment silence she continued\" we were happy very happy together and were about to get married when it all happened i was devastated but then i looked at these 4 people (his and her parents) and decided that i wud have to move on. i bought a new place brought in all four together and are now living happily.\" she said when i do sumthing for them i know shubhu smiles and its his happiness that i always want. i asked her how is she managing she said love is not only about his physical presence in my life it is about celebrating togetherness and that we do each day with our parents and i know somewhere he is also around here watching our every move keeping us protected. and then she added wish i had his child. after listening to all this i realised the strenghth of their love and coudnt help envying my friend on how lucky he was to have found this girl who is selflessly busy playing her role in their relation without the society bound order of marriage etc. i cudnt help feeling small at the girl's immense strength and pure love that their relation stands on. i relised how wrong i was in those days. she said she has enough memories to last for a lifetime and said. \" log aksar humse humari khushmijaji ka karan pucha karte hai to hum bh palat kat kar kahte hai, huzoor apki aindagi mein yaadein hai par humari to har ek yaad hi jindagi hai\" a huge salute to you girl and lots of respect to you. indeed life is beautiful its just the matter of ones view to take the challenges.Salute to the girl!

Yes, I was trying to put a gift-wrapper around a small gift that my daughter was to present to the class teacher. There was time pressure. She had to report to school by 7:25 AM. And I forgot to do the job assigned to me previous evening. Unpardonable! I deserved the guilty-look that I wore on my face till I finished the job.But I felt really bad to see one health drink advertizement on television while doing that job. In the advt., one child complains that her mother provides her 'cheaper' health drink which compromises her growth, and not the costlier brand that was there in the advertizement. And the child thinks that the mother is guilty when it falters in any competition as if that health drink would have brought a winner! Mother is our first teacher. To put up a child against the mother to jack up sale of one product is simply ominous.'Shraddhaban labhate Jnanam' - one who respects, learns. Once we lose respect, we cease to learn. We learn from everybody. We learn from even non-living things.

Real education is that which enables one to stand on one's own legs.Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain, which runs a riot there, undigested, all your life. We must have life-building, man-making, character making assimilation of ideas. If you have assimilated five ideas, and made them your life and character, you have more education than the man who got by heart a whole library.Stand up and fight! Not one step back! That is the idea. Fight it out, whatever comes. Let the stars move from the sphere. Let the whole world stand against us! You gain nothing by being cowards. You have cried to all gods in the world. Has misery ceased? You are an infinite spirit, it doesn't befit you to be a slave. Arise! Awake! Stop not till the goal is reached!We want that education that India really needs. We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by which one can stand on one's own feet!\"Once when I was in Varanasi, I was passing through a place where there was a large tank of water on one side and a high wall on the other.

Mobility is an issue for her and she is mostly on wheel-chair, does not want to wait for knee transplantation till my winter vacation. Had to say 'No' to a very important responsibility for which the nation looks towards IIT with bated breath, as it needs lots of traveling and I need to give time to mother. Felt honoured that I was considered capable enough for that very, very challenging job.The knee operation is planned at Fortis, Kolkata. Discussion is on with the doctor. Hospital stay could be for two weeks. Post operation physiotherapy for six weeks, is critical. Mother is prepared that I might not be available everyday by her side during hospital stay. But, I don't like that, feel stressed - how I would be able to manage both professional and family commitments, I do not yet know.I personally was having one symptom. This apparently indicated one parameter not doing good and would require prolonged medication. Test was suggested. Otherwise too, annual check-up was due. Last year some of the parameters were on the border line. We have a family history of high blood pressure. I fare 140/90 for long which again is considered borderline.One set of blood test was conducted on TUE (empty stomach) and the other was done on THU (post breakfast). It was not possible on WED due to morning class.I was to take test reports, meet doctor, get blood pressure checked on THU evening and perhaps to get started with medicine which was not required so far for me.Then came the THU afternoon / evening. Received something which was not expected at all. More than what was delivered, the way it was delivered was very disturbing. Felt bad for the team I serve and feel proud of, that comprises of young, enthusiastic, hard working people, devoted to the cause.Defended to the extent possible. Felt grateful for the support received across the vertical. Even then had a sleepless THU night, may be for not facing a situation like that in my earlier association here, may be because of the quality of company I enjoyed till now or may be for getting used to certain kind of approach (Link to one post, Link to one youtube video). Thanks again for the support received from across the hierarchy.And yes, missed the doctor's appointment and could not collect the test report because of this unfortunate matter. Family members were so anxious to see me that much agitated when I returned home at 9 PM, they forgot to scold me that I had missed the doctor's appointment, neither I could collect the blood test report.Comes Friday. There was a 10:30-12:30 double lecture and 1:30-4:30 lab. I thought that I wouldn't be able to survive beyond one lecture hour and would compensate one class later. But, chalk-duster-blackboard and hundred students before you, you are a transformed self. We couldn't feel how two hours passed.Phone call from outstation close relative came at 5 PM. There was a string of advice, that I must not miss the doctor's appointment that evening. Also, I was advised to be regular and sincere on taking medicines that doctor prescribes.The writing on the wall was clear. I too almost gave up!Entered doctor's chamber at 7 PM. He checked reports. The borderline cases or the shooting beyond the range for two parameters do not need medication but rationing of some food items.Then came the final test, measurement of blood pressure. Like a student who knows that he is going to fail for activities in the run up of the examination, and prefers to surrender before the examiner expecting the unexpected, I told timidly as the doctor put the blood pressure cuff around my arm, \"I am little disturbed. Had some fight. I don't expect to do well.\"The measurement was done. Doctor looked at me while unwrapping the blood pressure cuff. I knew the result, that it would be an 'F'. Still I asked, \"How much?\"Sharp came the answer, \"140 / 90.\"OMG! OMG! I did goood!!One person felt disappointed though :-) because I didn't join her club. She takes medicine regularly for the love of it and wondered how I got spared this time too!Endnote: That I passed the test made me qualified enough to honour the guest list of printed invitation cards, where local community just outside IIT Kharagpur campus were organizing a blood donation camp this morning! And when asked, made a short speech too on voluntary blood donation movement and its significance in our healthcare."},
{"title": "Parables", "date": "Thursday, August 29, 2013", "text": "We usually study parables when young - in our teens or pre-teen days. The lessons often are not fully understood as we do not get exposed to different facets of life at that age. That which are supposed to be etched in our memory, often ends up in stories that we can afford to forget. I was told that a management school (not of IIT Kharagpur but one of the IIMs) used parables from Ramakrishna Kathamrita (Gospel of Ramakrishna Link) to educate their management cadre who go for administrative jobs. Here are few parables that I studied in young days. It is always worth revisiting the parables of different families even if we consider ourselves grown-ups now and educate ourselves once more. ... refresher's course?!! :-)From parables of Sri Ramakrishna (Link), on what we consider as reliable information:A man said to his friend, \"I have just seen a house fall down with a terrific crash.\" Now, the friend to whom he told this had received an English education. He said: \"Just a minute. Let me look it up in the newspaper.\" He read the paper but could not find the news of a house falling down with a crash. Thereupon he said to his friend: \"Well, I don't believe you. It isn't in the paper; so it is all false.\"Panchatantra is treasure-house of such wisdom. It used animal characters to drive home the message, perhaps to avoid offending high ego of human species! There are several cartoon films on it which are quite popular. The following story is available as narrative in this youtube video (Link). This shows how a foolish friend can harm more than an enemy.There lived a king who had a monkey as his pet. He loved him very much. The king gave him all freedom and treated him as his good friend. The monkey used to be with the King wherever he was. One day, the king was taking a walk in the royal garden. As usual the monkey was walking with him. Suddenly the monkey started to jump here and there. King: What? What happened? Today his action doesn't look normal. Hey what's the matter?King: What happened to you today? Why are you doing this? There should be a reason for this weird kind of an act. hmm...The King looked around and was shocked.King: AH... sh.sh. snake.The monkey leaped across and killed the snake.King: I am alive because of you. Thank you so much.Next day the king narrated the whole story in the court.King: Since he has saved my life he is been appointed as my chief guard.Minister: Oh king! A monkey is a monkey. He cannot think and act. You may kindly think it over and decide.King: He has saved me once and I believe that he will save me in the future too. Since no one could question the king everyone of them remained silent.One day...King (to monkey): Hey my dear. I am going to teach you. Say A for apple, B for boy, C for cat, D for dog.... good boy. Ok I am going for some rest. Make sure no one disturbs me. If some one or something disturbs me just say shooo.shooo and get rid of them. Got it.King: Wow intelligent.The king was asleep. A little while later a fly came near by. At once the monkey said shoo.. shoo. The fly flew away. After some time the fly sat on the king's hand. Again the monkey said shoo shoo and got rid of the fly. The fly came back and this time it sat on the king's neck. Looking at this the monkey got wild and drew the sword to kill the fly. Poor king. The fly escaped from the blow but the king.... Aesop's fables find its way to become a must-read for all kids. This fable says why one should be careful about flatterers (Link).A Crow, having stolen a bit of meat, sat in a tree and held it in her beak. A hungry Fox, seeing this, envied the crow and wished to have the meat for himself. So he came up with a cunning plan.“How gracious you are,” he exclaimed, “how beautifully your feathers shine! Oh, if only your voice were equal to your beauty, you would deserve to be called the Queen of Birds!”The Crow was really flattered by these words, so, anxious to be called the Queen of Birds, she gave a loud caw and dropped the meat. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the Crow: “My dear Crow, you have a nice voice, indeed, but I’m afraid you have no wits.”I shall end this post with a parable of Jesus. This is the famous story of good Samaritan. It tells who actually is one's neighbour, the one who cares (Link). A lawyer stood up to put him (Jesus) to the test, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" He said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read?\" And he answered, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\" And he said to him, \"You have answered right; do this, and you will live.\" But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\" Jesus replied, \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion, and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, `Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.' Which of these three, do you think, proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\" He said, \"The one who showed mercy on him.\" And Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\""},
{"title": "Sound of Kharagpur", "date": "Sunday, August 25, 2013", "text": "While returning from Brahmakumaris' centre on Rakshabandhan evening, got stuck in one place at bungalow-side near railway station. Few snapshots at the end of the video shows what the place looked like once upon a time (1938-1940). I shall write about this old Kharagpur town later. Coming back to present time, there was ceremonial parade on the road. And true to Kharagpur tradition (Kharagpur town, different from IIT Kharagpur) there was loud-speaker and music. And the tune that was played made me feel that I am frozen in time. This is the Kharagpur of my childhood in railway quarter of old settlement area (Link). The same song that was one of the most popular at that time is played with similar musical accompaniment. A short clip was recorded and is available as background music :-) of following video.We used to have full volume music in our locality on all occasions - for birth, death, marriage, retirement (not exaggerating!), all social, religious functions  for family and youth clubs. It included lottery draw and orchestra nights on make-shift stage.True to its cosmopolitan nature, we had such occasions almost everyday. Every year one company used to come with traveling kiosks and stationed in the ground in front of our quarter. For about a month they used to play loud music and sell cloths to customers, \"Cali Cloth asuchi / Koun koun anuchi / Shirting anuchi, Suiting anuchi ..(Cali Cloth has come. What are the things brought? Shirting, suiting ...)\" Once my chemistry private tutor of class XI-XII who used to stay at IIT side came to our quarter. He got scared how I could study with loud speakers blazing like that. It was all but practice. I would rather say, my concentration increases if songs are played in the background :-)The following are some of those sounds of Kharagpur that I grew up with and that make me feel nostalgic.The original Sambalpuri song that I heard minimum 500 times and relived in it on 22nd Aug. evening.The famous Bagh / Sher (Tiger) dance during Mata Puja.The Ravana Pora (burning) is still one of the biggest event (another link).We stayed next to Bara Maszid (three tombs in the google map of 1st video) and grew up listening to beautiful azans. The following rendering, the voice is similar to what we used to hear everyday.Attended many such kirtans with my mother in Bhowanipur, Subhaspally area.Finally, the sound of mela - this year's Rathayatra Fair.And Bengali version of following prayer and Swadesh Mantra of Vivekananda every afternoon at B.N.R. ground before P.T. and play."},
{"title": "Happy Rakshabandhan", "date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2013", "text": "This time it was spread over two days. My sister telephoned yesterday and wished in that distant mode. One old acquaintance, now a monk at Ramakrishna Mission centre reminded in chat how we used to celebrate in our younger days!Yesterday evening, one student came to my office and invited me to today's evening function at Brahmakumaris' local centre. I said that I would be able to go this time and regretted that in an earlier function (Shivaratri) I was occupied. The student reminded that it is Rakshabandhan day and said, \"If you do not go, Didi (elder sister) will come here.\" I knew that the threat was real :-) and it would have been unthinkable for me to make the revered Didi come all the way.It was a 6 PM function. I had my grounds fully covered by that time here! The drizzle also stopped as I set off. On reaching, I found that a meditation session was going on with Didi  at centre and also other sisters were there. There were few IIT Kharagpur students there. After some devotional songs, Didi explained nicely the significance of this function - the Rakhi, the central flower of self, attached on two sides by two strings of affection and purity. Didi quoted Vivekananda's Chicago address and how his address that started with \"Sisters and brothers\" touched every heart. It is the life behind that gives power to words. She talked about importance of character buildling. Yesterday, the sisters went to district jail and tied Rakhi to inhabitants there. After the talk, she and another sister tied Rakhi to me. While doing that she also blessed me. I also received a book and sweets.It was great to see executives of local Satya Sai Trust and Patanjali Trust also there and Rakhi were tied to them and also to all those who gathered. Promised to visit again before leaving."},
{"title": "Perception-Responsibility-Criticism", "date": "Saturday, August 17, 2013", "text": "The facebook friends request list was swelling up! It was time to take action. I need to be particularly careful for requests coming from IIT Kharagpur students who are still on roll. It is a strict - 'No', 'No' for Dept. students till they graduate. For others, I need to visit student database, check if there is any possibility of intersection somewhere in their remaining stay here where I shall be awarding them grades. If not, then I go ahead. This is because, to me, we not only need to be impartial, we should also appear to be impartial. We are surrounded by students, young and intelligent, the competent and confident, the makers of our country's destiny. The perception is important. As much the foot-print that we leave.Often, this leaves us with limited choice or has the potential of breaking heart! My batch-mate's son has taken admission in our institute this year. Had a session with her entire family when they came for document verification. Told the son what we tell all freshers [Link to Fresh Blood] - that clearing IIT-JEE and getting into an IIT is an important step, but only a step, may be a big step. It is not the destination but a part of one's journey. It is important what one does with the best of the facilities the country can give to its young people. Our country is not rich enough to give similar facility to all. Thus, a student here has to take more responsibility and make the most of what he gets. If one does not feel for the country or not interested to take responsibility then why one deserves more facility than others? In that case, let nation's wealth be spent equally for all with no exception!I'll be lying if I say that I was not worried about the consequence of this lecture :-) to a young incumbent of IIT family, specially when his parents and sister was with him! But the more I spend time with young generation, the more is my confidence in them. And I was proven right again! My friend rang me after return and told me that the son has become a kind of fan. And then came what I started with in this post - 'friend' request in facebook from him. I rang and told that I am sorry and I would keep the son waiting for few more years. Today, when I accepted the 'friend' request of G. Sec. of one hall, a senior student but still a student, I first went to his student profile and assured myself that he is from a dept. which is far enough!Perception is a not-so-small issue for a person who holds an office of responsibility. One of my colleague was freelancing in one student activity (extra-academic, link). All other colleagues who held the official responsibility of that activity, were in praise and felt grateful. When a new position was created there, this colleague assumed the responsibility officially. And one morning, he had a pensive look. For some reason, he needs to be away for two consecutive weekends (the activity takes place on Saturday). Others were there to do little extra when he or someone is away. But he was feeling bad. As a freelancer, his engagement was far more enjoyable. If he had done one unit of work that time, it was getting noticed and he used to feel good about it. But now with official responsibility, if he does not do one unit of work, he feels that it is getting noticed and feels bad about it. Take this for example. A person was giving lift in his car to waiting passers-by almost always whenever he was going to station from campus. He used to be applauded by passers-by. The day he takes the official responsibility of ferrying people from campus to station, every single refusal (even if he has some issue) would receive discredit, criticism from same passers-by and no-credit for doing the job well rest of the times.No wonder that a person's life changes a lot when he assumes a responsible position. I may feel grateful to the service offered by a person. But, as a responsible person, I have to go by merit and show my gratitude at personal level. My mother was cared very well by two attendants when she was hospitalized weeks back [Link]. They come from a poor family background. I gave them my cellphone number and told them to contact me if they need any help which I can offer in my personal capacity. One of them expressed something for her children's study. But the other's request, she herself might not have been knowing, was something that enters a different territory. And I politely expressed my inability for the second.Often, it is easier said! Over the years, our dealing with people develops a standard for ourselves - a perception, an image. It is not always possible to maintain that standard or one-to-one relationship with new role and new responsibility. We fall short. If we try to reach out to maintain old norm, we may fall short in new role. I used to spend a lot of time with some local youth encouraging them, counseling them etc. One of them after completing engineering, is now engaged with a telephone service company at Guwahati. He came to Kharagpur this weekend (to return on Monday) and wanted to meet me today morning regarding job issue he is facing there. He cannot discuss it over phone and needed to meet me for sometime. But our house-maid had taken leave today and I was at the disposal of Her Highness :---) at home, helping her as and when needed. The young person was waiting for my call, and I had no option but to tell him that I have job queued  up at home where I do not have the control over sequence. For example, only when Her Highness finishes brooming (I am not allowed to), I can start mopping work assigned to me. I asked him to wait at home and spend time with his son, now that he has returned after a month, I shall catch up with him at his residence.Amongst all these, I could dispatch the first set of the manuscript of new edition of one book yesterday. Feel relieved to be able to meet the deadline. But on Independence Day evening, was torn apart for not being able to be a part of the audience where our students were putting up a play. And one knows how much effort goes behind a stage performance like that! That evening it rained heavily, and I got immersed in an important segment of the manuscript preparation. Sorry folks! Anyways, the new edition of other title is just published. It was supposed to be an international edition with review done by faculty of US universities in the beginning and again at the end of the work. And it earned very good review. The publisher was very happy. They were at final stage of releasing it first in US. But something funny happened and I respect the confidentiality of all concerned and have absorbed the feelings for things not going the way it should have been, for something beyond control! Happy to see that new edition is released now and here. There are few more stories cooking! But let the chicken get counted only when the egg is hatched :-)[Endnote: Met the young engineer. Discussed his issues. At the end he said, \"How come that what appeared as all negative then, appears positive now!\" :-) For me it was great to find that within two month's of his job, he has earned respect from his employer who are frugal in all count and for his hard work and honesty. While I was talking to him, Nibedita and her husband rang from Zlin, Czech Republic. They talked about the progress made on the foundation work (Link). Also, they said that Mayo Clinic, USA personnel have gone through the post and appreciated how it was woven. Thanks to all for kind words.]"},
{"title": "Happy Independence Day", "date": "Thursday, August 15, 2013", "text": "The daughter told yesterday evening that she would be accompanying me to Independence Day flag-hoisting function. Many of her class-mates would be performing there in a dance program on patriotic theme. It was not possible for me to take her in earlier years as I had to go quite early and remain engaged with NSS team, food-packet distribution to school children and other responsibilities. With baton passed to next in line there, it was possible to say a big yes this time.Listened to Prime Minister's address on television and then we two joined the audience of institute function. While my daughter paid a brief visit to her school-mates who were ready for performance and greeted them, I did the same to my NSS, IIT Kharagpur colleagues and student the team. Unfurling the national flag, Director, IIT Kharagpur said the following among other things in his address (Link), \"Independence gave us the freedom to shape our own destiny. On the altar of sacrifice of our countrymen, our founding fathers handed over to us this Institution to build, where the Indians of the future will be developed, who can transform the country to one where equality and prosperity go hand in hand. We at IIT Kharagpur are privileged and have been empowered by the citizens of India to do so. It is therefore our onerous responsibility to live up to their expectations. The people of this country pay for our sustenance in the hope that we shall change India and usher in a better future for them. We cannot afford to destroy the hopes and faith that they have bestowed on us.What India shall we build my friends? What sort of Indians shall we become? How shall we ensure that this gentle giant, as our country is historically known to be, is able to avoid the pitfalls of intolerance, belligerence, falsehood and timidity that challenge us today and help give its citizens, especially the illiterate, poor, oppressed and helpless, the education, empowerment, happiness and quality of life that they deserve?  How shall we become great not only in expertise and experience to make our people and the people of the world prosperous but also display qualities of fearlessness and sacrifice that will sanctify and guard our prosperity and happiness with the fence of virtue?We, the fortunate, owe our forefathers for whom we are able to celebrate this day, a great debt  - to make the poorest of the poor smile, the oppressed empowered and help our fellow countrymen meet their dreams. Let these be our dreams. Let us strive to do our bit with the courage, devotion and dedication it deserves. Let us build the India that will make people like Swami Vivekananda happy to see that his beloved people have again arisen and will stop not till the goal is reached.\" In this year's Republic Day function the then Director quoting Vivekananda said (Link1, Link2), \"No amount of politics would be of any avail until the masses in India are once more well educated, well fed, and well cared for. ... three things are necessary to make every man great,every nation great. (i) Conviction of the powers of goodness (ii) Absence of jealousy and suspicion (iii) Helping all who are trying to be and do good ... The road to the Good is the roughest and steepest in the universe. It is a wonder that so many succeed, no wonder that so many fall. Character has to be established through a thousand stumbles...Be determined not to curse anything outside, not to lay the blame upon any one outside, but be a man, stand up, lay the blame on yourself. You will find, that is always true. Get hold of yourself.\"The goal is clear. The road is cut out. We need to make us move avoiding all sorts of procrastination.After dropping the daughter at quarter went to a place called Bhowanipur (about 7 KM from campus) where a group of young people from local colleges organize themselves following ideals of Vivekananda. On a holiday like this, they held an extended study-circle. On the way felt proud to see many colours of Independence Day celebration."},
{"title": "Mother Nibedita", "date": "Sunday, August 11, 2013", "text": "This post is about Nibedita, mother of Kanishka Binayak. On 28th July, myself, and two senior faculty colleagues went to Midnapore Zilla Parishad Hall to attend the inauguration of Kanishka Binayak Memorial Foundation. District Magistrate (D.M.) in his opening note mentioned that he was mistaken initially to fathom the earnestness of Nibedita, her desire to start this foundation. The foundation aims to work for identification of a rare disease called hyperoxaluria. If not detected very early, death is inevitable. The son Kanishka Binayak met this inevitable on 22nd of May, 2011 when he was only nine and half years old. Besides D.M., renowned doctors from the district, Kolkata and Hyderabad came forward to support the foundation. In return journey, we remembered Laxmibai of Jhansi fame who fought war with her baby tied to her back.I was aware of Kanishka's deteriorating health and Nibedita's struggle when she was simultaneously working towards her Ph.D at Tomas Bata University, Czech Republic. We had occasional mail exchanges since both of us left our previous work place where we first met. The interaction was brief but I have fond memories of many people there across the vertical and feel at home if I visit that place even after 10+ years . There was no communication from Nibedita for some time and I was not aware that Kanishka was no more. In July, 2011 Nibedita was at the other end of a chat. She just read my blog post 'Rainbow Week' (Link). Thee quote of Arthur Ashe there in the section \"A friend in need' gave her answer to thousand queries / doubts. \"Why does GOD have to select you for such a bad disease\"? To this Arthur Ashe replied: \"The world over -- 50 million children start playing tennis, 5 million learn to play tennis, 500,000 learn professional tennis, 50,000 come to the circuit, 5000 reach the grand slam, 50 reach Wimbledon, 4 to semi final, 2 to the finals, when I was holding a cup I never asked GOD 'Why me?'. And today in pain I should not be asking GOD 'Why me?' \"And Kanishka was strong believer of God. He used to be always smiling, energetic, positive, full of love and compassion. He wanted to be a doctor. He used to do things fast as he knew that his days were numbered. Due to his proficiency in Czech language in such an early age, he got citizenship there and participated in international functions (Link1, Link2). In fact, doctors were not only surprised, but used to be worried to see his enthusiasm!Nibedita was always inquisitive about NSS (Link) or similar socially relevant work I could find myself in. She was convinced that she would do something relevant to the society at large. She took sometime to gather herself and in March 2012 successfully defended her PhD thesis (Link). In communicating the same, it was Kanishka's thought which she wanted to keep alive. I told Mother Nibedita to go through what was told to Sister Nibedita (Ms. Margaret Noble) (Link).Nibedita did the entire ground work of this Kanishka Binayak Memorial Foundation by herself. She brought Mayo Clinic, USA, specialists from Hyderabad and local doctors in same platform to serve the people.  In Kanishka's old school she started a memorial prize. We wish that Nibedita's mission, a mother's wish will be fulfilled. The foundation will act as a vehicle to to serve people. Once Nibedita wrote stating how valuable are the of blessings and support \"to go ahead , even though the path and way of my life is full of pain.\" Request all to bless and support our sister Nibedita, nay, Mother Nibedita in her endeavour. A Times of India report (Link) on Nibedita's effort is pasted below. And if you want listen to Nibedita directly here is what she speaks in the foundation opening (Link).[Endnote: Got a phone call from Nibedita after this blog post. District Administration is helping them a lot. The trust which is now running from home is asked to select a suitable land from options available.]Son Lost, NRI Kindles Hope Back HomeFrom Times of India | World | Category RSS: Jayanta Gupta, TNN May 28, 2013, 01.39AM ISTKOLKATA: Hers is a loss that no mother can ever come to terms with. But her zeal to bring about a change in the lives of other people has certainly helped Nibedita Saha to cope with her grief. In 2011, this lecturer and project manager at the Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic, lost her nine-and-a-half-year-old son Kanishka Binayak Saha to an extremely rare, enzyme-linked metabolic disorder.She plans to visit her hometown Midnapore in July and set up a medical foundation in Kanishka's memory, where children and adolescents will undergo screening for the deadly Primary HyperOxaluria (PH) and other metabolic disorders. The world-renowned Mayo Clinic has agreed to carry out the necessary tests to ascertain if a child is suffering from metabolic disorders.\"I have already got the foundation registered. I want to inaugurate it in July. Last year, I got in touch with Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and also visited Swasthya Bhavan. Kanishka wanted to be a doctor. He was truly special. Whenever I showered him with affection, he would ask me to take care of others as well. I want to use his memory to help others. My uncle already runs a diabetic clinic in Midnapore where he screens people and offers advice on management of the disease free of cost. Our foundation will deal with metabolic disorders,\" Nibedita told TOI from Ziln.During her visit to Kolkata in July-August, 2012, she discussed the matter with Kusum Adhikary, who was then joint director of health services (planning and development). \"She wants to open a foundation on rare congenital diseases. She did discuss the matter with me in detail and I did what was necessary before moving to my present posting,\" he said.PH is a disorder in which high quantities of Oxalic Acid build up in the system resulting in kidney stones and complete renal failure. The liver also gets affected badly. Kanishka underwent both kidney and liver transplants at his tender age but could not survive. One reason behind this was the absence of a set protocol to treat the disorder. When Kanishka was diagnosed with PH, the disorder wasn't even fully recognized in medical circles.\"Doctors at Mayo Clinic renewed their efforts after receiving samples from me, Kanishka and his father. It was then thought that the disorder occurs in only one child in a million. Today, doctors think that the rate could be much higher. Apart from PH, there are other metabolic disorders that can't be diagnosed unless DNA and genetic tests are carried out. Such tests are inaccessible to poor people. My effort will be to facilitate such tests so that children can be diagnosed at an early stage and they receive treatment,\" Nibedita said.The risk that children run of being born with metabolic disorders has been recognized in India as well. \"Metabolic liver disease (MLD) is not a rare etiology and should be suspected specially in a case with relevant family history and clinical profile. Approach to a case with MLD should be protocol-based so as to avoid unnecessary investigations and improve morbidity as well as mortality,\" Seema Alam, additional professor, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, has written in an article published in January, 2013, in Child India, the official e-newsletter of Indian Academy of Pediatrics.Nibedita says that she got the idea of setting up a foundation in Kanishka's memory after being invited to speak at the 10th International Workshop on Primary Hyperoxalaria in Bonn. At the workshop, she shared her experiences of her 'journey with Kanishka'. It was from this conference that several doctors came to know of the sufferings of somebody diagnosed with this metabolic disorder. After all, only a few cases are ever diagnosedDoctors had told Nibedita that the last time they heard of a patient with such a disorder was 20 years ago in France.\"This is a disorder that kills from the inside. Nothing is evident externally. Kanishka was a very active boy. I am extremely thankful to the doctors at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, USA and those in the Czech Republic who did their best to treat Kanishka. Along with a clinic to screen people, I would also like to start a school in Midnapore in Kanishka's memory,\" Nibedita added."},

Ma (my mother) is recovering from U.T. infection at IIT Kharagpur hospital. Osteoarthritis is there as company for quite sometime now. Knee replacement is planned at the earliest opportunity. That is when she comes over the present ailment. Both orthopedic surgeon and Ma are confident and keen to go ahead.Anjan enters. Ma is very happy. She greets Anjan with \"Kemon achho, Baba (How are you, my child)?\" We laughed and took a dig at Ma. How come being a patient, she is asking the well-being of the visitor who comes to see her! Yes, Ma is stable now. As I type this at 7:30 PM from hospital cabin, waiting for the night-shift attendant Ritadi to come, Ma at my back is reading anecdotes from Ramakrishna Kathamrita aloud. And her active listener is the morning shift attendant Parbatidi.Ma was admitted for one day in March, 2013 at Chinsurah Govt. hospital for fever and cold. Even there within one day she became very popular. She always carries positive vibration along with her and always thinks of well-being of all. Her motherly feeling extends beyond the family boundary. In fact, in my young days all my friends were at equal ease, if not more, in interacting with Ma.Ma now is trying to teach reading and writing alphabets to Parbatidi. For want of notebook, the writing effort started on blank space of newspaper that Ma reads everyday. Happy to see this effort, the ward sister said that she would provide a notebook. Once Parbatidi's husband came to talk to her for some reason. Ma told the husband to take good care of the wife. Ma was full of pride when she narrated to me how Ritadi is raising her two daughters by earning little extra by this night shift hospital duty. Ma makes sure that both get adequate rest / sleep as they have families to look after when they go back.In our family, it is no surprise that my daughter is closest to her. Her every arrival in hospital makes Ma forget almost all discomforts. They play ludo, gossip. Today the visiting doctor told that if her daughter is free he would bring her in the evening round to play ludo with Ma.Feel proud and pray to be a worthy son. Feel blessed and remember my father too (Link)."},
{"title": "Convocation 2013", "date": "Sunday, July 28, 2013", "text": "The 59th Convocation of IIT Kharagpur was held yesterday. Such a day is always special. More so for the parting message graduating students receive from the alma mater - the responsibility, the challenges ahead, the expectation around them and their role.It was overwhelming that Honourable Higher Education Minister of the country in his message expressed 'regards' to the graduating batch. In his opening note his message was, \"Thestars of this convocation of course are graduating students and therefore Iwant to begin my talk by offering them heartiest congratulations, best wishesand regards.\"And it was no surprise that he has high expectation from IITians. We heard, \"IIThas presented us most successful model of empowering India’s youth. ..Studentsof IIT have a special place and also a responsibility since they symbolizeIndia’s urge to become a technological superpower. I am certain that all of youare full of ambitious ideas for your future path. May your dreams come true.Look for the highest. Aim at the highest and you shall reach the highest.Remember “Education is the manifestation of perfection already in a man” andCharacter is the test of that manifestation. It is my firm belief that it is the contribution of the youth which is at the core of India’s rapid economic progress. While all of you have been fortunate enough to upgrade and empower yourselves to quality education and training, the path of social and economic revolution India is undergoing, there is a much larger segment of young Indians expecting to be a part of this process. We need to face the challenge for creating better access for young people for quality education and training and make them a part of the national development process to ensure an all inclusive growth. ..Let there be a smile in every Indian’s face.\". This was echoed in the voice of Director, IIT Kharagpur. \"Let there be a smile in every face of our countrymen. And let there be rays of hope scattering from every corner of the nation.\" At the end of the Convocation ceremony, new Director assumed responsibility.Chairman of the Board of Governor was clear and direct. He was straight to the point when he said, \"Now it is your turn to generate new and path-breaking ideas. Dear students, please remember, knowledge has no limit, no boundaries. Your quest for excellence must continue. You should not bask in the glory of your current achievements as that will soon become the past. This is what the IIT System teaches you…The country is looking at you with hope and expectation. You have all the talent an brilliance. .. You should use technical knowledge for the benefit of the people and create wealth for the nation…IIT degree holders, you will carry with you the spirit of IIT education system. From now on, you will be the brand ambassador of IIT Kharagpur in India and all over the world. Today is the beginning of new era of dissemination to follow for the passion of the profession of your choice. Dear students, honesty and integrity are two tools to give you mental strength. These two coupled with sincere effort effort will take you to the path of glory in your profession. In turn the country will benefit with the obstacles and challenges India is facing today will soon be overcome…. I would like to end with what Mahatma Gandhi said, “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. Education can end. But learning is a journey.\" Not only our outgoing students, we educators too got educated. Hope, we can build further on this. The President Gold Medal (PGM) Holder conducted the oath in Sanskrit to all graduating students (youtube link). The chief guest told students if they understood the meaning of it - dedicating themselves to the service of the nation.It was convocation lunch venue. PGM holder who happened to be from our Dept., came forward with his friend. Both tried to touch feet which I stopped somehow. And I had also the same to say - what is the meaning of the oath taken.In the evening, attended the Sitar recital by maestro Pt. Sahid Parvez briefly, taking a detour from the evening walk. (The youtube video has glimpses of few of the events. Some of the photos is credited to one of my Dept. colleague <Link>. There may be error of 1-2 words from my side in taking down notes from the speech made.)"},
{"title": "Aashiqui", "date": "Sunday, July 21, 2013", "text": "A July 18 mail led to a new awakening. The \"Film projection unit of Netaji Auditorium has been converted to a DIGITAL CUBE SYSTEM with the latest state-of-the-art UFO Satellite links.\" The mail also told that with this we \"pay homage to our old PH... system which had served so well over six decades since the inception of IIT Kharagpur.\" I was not a movie-goer type during my B.Tech. or Ph.D days here. However, I oblige myself with 2-3 movies a semester now. In those days, we had a yell emanating from the movie hall \"T-a-r-a-p-a-d-a\", every occasion something went wrong with movie projection. We were told that the character Tarapada is a myth. Whoever handles the projection system becomes Tarapada. One of the reason why I do not hear Tarapada-shout now is the decreased number of footfalls. The 60 year old movie projection system was no more reliable in terms of audio and video quality. Also, it is difficult to get movie prints of all the films on reels. The technology has moved to digital systems - hard disk, satellite download etc. An effort started this year to  move to digital projection system. I was a part of the team that visited few modern cinema halls in Kolkata. We educated ourselves with lots of literature, met people, visited projection rooms. The new system implemented is what our Technology Film Society (TFS) found good and what takes care of technology, operational and other issues.This has been the first movie weekend with the new system. Wanted to meet our TFS colleagues, with whom I spent few days earlier this year, after this transition which is major for them. Also, wanted to have a feel of the new system.The 3:00 - 6:00 PM show was housefull! Chatted with TFS staffs, and learnt how they are handling the new system. Visited the projection room. They told what more they need. Watched the movie till halftime. The movie was Aashiqui II. Both audio and video quality have improved and there was no interruption. Didn't watch after half-time as (i)I learnt that there is a sad end (Hero dies) and (ii)I had some other responsibility. I watched two movies last sem. and felt so bad that the persons with shady character and doing unlawful things were portrayed as hero in those movies. No wonder that we see so much indifference or rather inclination towards such stuffs if this is what we feed our young population. Yes, they were primarily comedy (Race 2 and Special 26) but people who watch them take the comic as well as the unlawful stuff. Not so easy to unmix them and slowly but surely they enter our value system. Compared to that this movie was more of tragedy but has certain respect for value system. The hero, however, does lots of unnecessary and illogical maneuvers to increase melodrama quotient. But who watches mainstream Bollywood movie to find rationality in it :-) Perhaps, I would have liked struggle or ending like Ek Vivaah .. Aisa Bhi [Youtube Link], watched two semester back where too one comes forward to extend help to another. But there is a difference between Rajshri and Masheh Bhatt production!! Isn't it? People watched Aashiqui with the first projection system IIT Kharagpur had. They begin journey II with the second movie projection system here when Aashiqui II is screened. While we welcome the new, we feel sad for the demise of the old system that stood by us for six l-o-n-g decades. Our homage to the old system. It is time to see if we become Aashiq of the new system and TFS officials get what they were lamenting for, more footfalls, more yaarana from movie buffs. One must say that the beginning has been good."},
{"title": "Five Years With NSS, IIT Kharagpur", "date": "Sunday, July 14, 2013", "text": "[Before I could type a single letter for the body of this post, a phone call came. RKMVU (Link) has sent about 200 English Grammar titles for two village high schools in our neighbourhood where VIVEKDISHA, an online two way distance learning program (Link, Link) is implemented.]One faculty member from a different department came forward in a faculty meeting held last week. The word of appreciation that followed was nothing but an assertion of the collective will that exists at IIT Kharagpur. Then there was a short term course dinner. One faculty opined that the work got expanded quite a lot. Yes, that is why to assist new Program Coordinator, the institute is providing one new position who too will be associated with coordination. Not only in this, whenever NSS team requested support from the institute or larger IIT Kharagpur community, the same was available.We worked as a team. I don't mind if someone says that I was lucky to get such a strong faculty team in NSS :-) The dedication, the discipline, the camaraderie, the leading from front, the sense of responsibility from all team members - it was a privilege to be a part of such a team. The students as well as the village / slum people were little skeptic in the beginning. Most of our students do not know the local language. NSS fund is next to nothing (Rs. 6000 per semester per village/slum) to make the kind of contribution which village people were expecting from us. Gradually, we could establish our foot-print which is now has spread to about 20 village / slum of our neighbourhood. Glory to the spirit of the youth!We got good amount of support from alumni, campus community, institute which made the work easier. The panchayets and the offices of BDO, SDO found a friend in us. It was great to collaborate with RKMVU in implementing VIVEKDISHA program. We got lot of encouragement from higher officials of NSS, be it Regional Head's Office at Kolkata or Program Adviser's Cell at New Delhi.I started as Program Officer in NSS, taking care of a small unit of about 50 student volunteers. This was the learning phase for me. There again I got a very, very enthusiastic and disciplined team to work with. The students developed a website for the unit. This was given a name 'Team Vivek'. The website still exists and is a testimonial of the effort the then student team put. It can be found here (Link), frozen in time. In fact, this and my first NSS Annual Camp was the starting point of rebuilding the NSS activities here. I must thank the ABVYM (Link) Annual Camp experience that I had in my young days (Link), which helped. Of course, NSS camp has a character of its own (Link, Link).Then I was entrusted with the responsibility of Program Coordinator of NSS, IIT Kharagpur. I have already stated the amount of support received from all quarters. I would like to reiterate here what I said to the correspondent of campus newspaper of students (Link). \"Let me clarify at the outset that if we have achieved anything, the credit goes to the team where our students form the bulk of the members. Everybody associated with NSS, directly or indirectly – the administration, the faculty, the larger campus community-have contributed in their own way. I just got an opportunity to coordinate the strong collective will and energy that was already present and played my role as everybody else played theirs.\"Having completed my tenure as Program Coordinator, it is time to pass the flag. NSS, IIT Kharagpur will go from strength to strength given the strong goodwill it enjoys, the focus it has. The fresh idea, the fresh energy will catapult it to next level. Prof. Debasis Roy, the new Program Coordinator has years of experience in NSS as Program Officer. He led the team of students which served the farthest of the villages reached by us, about 10 KM from campus. Also, he had been instrumental in successful conduct of NSS Annual Camp. Prof. Abraham George will assist him in coordination. He too has years of experience in leading students in slum and village school based NSS activities.As for myself, I'll always be available as NSS resource person. In fact, shall be updating NSS blog (Link) for some more time. And there is another responsibility related to Extra Academic Activities of IIT Kharagpur. It can be found here (Link). More about that experience later.It is time to say bye and thanks to all, students, faculty, larger IIT Kharagpur community, local administration and village / slum people,  who made this five years of experience in NSS all the more memorable. Thank you, thank you very, very much! I wish I could reach each of you individually to express my gratitude. Thanks again."},

There may be an auto-correct mechanism at final desk where PCG (phonocardiogram) was corrected with more popular medical use ECG. Both of us felt bad on this mix-up and HT is expected to provide a corrigendum. The title chosen by the publisher may be what makes an article connect to reader. It may invite cell phone companies to take interest and the technology penetration can improve, specially for people in remote places and having limited mobility due to old age or otherwise. So far, we have got good result with this on valvular disorders using clinical data in our IIT Kharagpur lab.I must admit that it is always a pleasure to interact with our friends in media who helps us to connect with larger population with technology developments happening here. This inspires us to deliver more and reinforces our commitment. Besides HT, had interaction earlier with Economic Times, Statesman, Telegraph (Anandabazar group), Headlines Today and other correspondents on technology development, with Times of India correspondent during then President His Excellency Dr.  A P J Abdul Kalam's visit to IIT Kharagpur, with Anandabazar correspondent on NSS team visiting a local tribal village to address an important issue and others on NSS activities.

{"title": "Poorva Express", "date": "Sunday, June 30, 2013", "text": "I type this sitting in Shatabdi Express. This is a return journey from Bhubaneshwar to Kharagpur. There was an invited talk in a workshop at IIIT yesterday afternoon. The train compartment is one-third full. Shatabdi – Rajdhani trains are special. The travel time is less. Trains run on shared tracks. Other express trains are held up to make way for these. Similarly, express trains make passenger trains wait. However, in suburban sections passenger trains rule. The passengers there are organized force.June 15, 2013. Poorva Express at New Delhi station. We had reservation in 3 Tier AC Sleeper Coach B2. There were only one unreserved compartment in the front. Train information system of Indian Railways showed that there should have been two unreserved coaches after loco. There were more people in our compartment than the no. of berths, right from the start. The coach attendant were very courteous to these extras. One such person was found to raise currency notes from his book-pocket a little when conductor came. Another extra person slept in the passage between two berths at night in our coup. There was announcement in the Delhi station for Rajdhani Express that there must not be any extra person in the compartments.One hour after we started from Delhi, our train was taken to siding of a small station. Why this unscheduled stop? The ‘extras’ who were regular laughed at our ignorance. While our train was stranded there for more than one hour, five-six Rajdhani Express to different destinations passed. The station master of that small station asked me not to worry. He said that our train would make-up at night. It did not and the late increased to 2 hours. The train information system says that average delay of Poorva Express is 4 hours. One wonders why cannot Poorva start after all these Rajdhani-s.June 16, 5 PM, Bardhhaman Station, the same Poorva Express. Last stop Howrah is about 100KM, 90 minute away. Our B2 compartment has become half-empty. I boarded the unreserved compartment in the front of the train for the last part of the journey. It was full to the brim. One of the toilet was seen as place holder of 3-4 people. I just managed to get some space to put my two feet. One inch this side or that side, people were sitting on floor or standing.  In the space marked for 8 people in reserved 3 tier compartment (3+3+2), there were  about three times more, 24 people in the unreserved compartment. Bringing it down to 16 (which is luxury in current standard : 5+5 on either side 1+1 on two single window seats and 2+2 on two bunks) with additional compartments makes railway earn twice as much the seat capacity. Even without the sleeper or reservation charge, the earning from these compartments won’t be less compared to others. One wonders how difficult it is to give little comfort to them who also deserve.I was standing not far from the door. It was not possible to go further inside the compartment which was full. There were 7-8 young people jostling near the door. They are into labour intensive jobs in and around Delhi. One could listen what they were discussing among themselves. They were discussing what they found enjoyable and the attempts they made so far to enjoy them. Little or no education, tough job condition, insecure future, difficult life condition, add to these, plenty of certain stuffs in newspapers, magazines, movie, mobile / internet downloads, MMS (cheap mobile phone is not all boon). The topline movies, the reality shows (even the ones that includes children) promoting “entertainment, entertainment and entertainment” and defining entertainment in certain way, it is but natural to see what we see occupying the mindspace of youth; that of what turns into addiction, what poisons slowly but surely.The science of life shows the relationship.   Thought  ---> Action ---> Habit ---> Propensity (Character)Thought precedes action. Repeated action becomes habit. Habit when deep becomes a propensity. Collection of propensities is character. The formative stage of a character (and also if a change is attempted) depends a lot on what we are fed as a thought. Later the character initiates thought and action through a feedback loop, that reinforces.We think about what we come across - what we read, what we see, and the kind of persons we come in contact with. If we offer our young generation inputs which are not positive and inspiring, how do we expect the society to get rid of negativity and the inglorious things that we see around us? We cannot get marigold if what we plant is parthanium. The tighter and tougher law attempts to treat the symptom and not the cause. We are alarmed today by the crimes of most heinous type. If we feed people sex and violence, selfishness and immorality, matter over mind, can we expect that we will be surrounded by people of noble character who do not cheat, who do not abuse? Unless we promote and recognize human values in us, in the society from young age, we are leading ourselves to ‘dog eats dog’ world.If we treat fellow-being as human, then we can expect human qualities from them. Also, we ourselves are got to learn many human qualities from them. [Video Link] There may be aberrations. Even after being treated as human, some may allow the animal-self to get better of him. Law is there to make such choice costly for them. But we should proactively create and nurture an environment to let the human aspect, the divine aspect of one to blossom in every strata of the society. Access to education, education of right kind that develops complete personality and not just a leading rank in a competitive exam., is the key. Scoring high percentage in exam. is important, but it is more important to learn what goes into making a good human being who cares, who shares. It is time to focus on who are educating our nation and what are they educating; and what is leading by examples. [Here is a bio of RKMVU teacher: Link :Readers’ comments too are interesting.] Each of us leaves a print in the society. Whether we are conscious about it or not, we like it or not, the society - specially, the young cannot escape having examples like us before them. If they are what we see them as today, we cannot avoid our responsibility on what we presented before them. If we want to address the issues our nation faces, we need to reach out to every section of the society. And this should be more than symbolism, the genuineness in our approach makes the difference. We are in praise of relief operations carried out by young jawans of army in Uttarakhand. Do we ourselves or young members of our family have ever attempted any relief / social service work in our neighbourhood with same sincerity?  It is not just money or donation made. How we do what we do are more important. What is our attitude? Is it that of service (i.e. kindness put into action) or do we think that the downtrodden are burdens? Giving money to an NGO will never yield what personal involvement, engagement will. Nation-building responsibility of mine cannot be outsourced. Few days back, a point came in an informal  discussion, here at IIT Kharagpur. Can we have tea in the houses of village, slum that we visit? We may start with the village / slum of our house maid. If one has reservation over hygiene, tea would be fine because the water is boiled. To this, a very, very senior faculty participating in the discussion, remembered a Baltic saying on Three Cups of Tea. \"The first time you share tea with a Balti, you are a stranger. The second time you take tea, you are an honored guest. The third time you share a cup of tea, you become family...\"If we do not learn to live together, we shall perish together. We may be boarder of Rajdhani Express, Poorva Express or a passenger train. We may have reservation or we may be travelling in unreserved compartments. Let us start by a simple thing - let us have occasions to have tea together.  We can seek help of IRCTC if we need that."},

{"title": "Vivekananda : A Tribute", "date": "Tuesday, June 18, 2013", "text": "It was an honour and privilege to participate in many functions to commemorate 150th birth anniversary of Vivekananda. These were functions hosted by local people, the institute and of course, NSS, IIT Kharagpur.  Articles were sought in a few places and I tried to write something. One English article recently came online. This was published earlier in print volume of Vivek-Jivan in its anniversary issue. This monthly is published by Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal (Link) who have taken up the primary task of 'man-making, character-building' that Vivekananda prescribed for all and before any other thing. With this primary education in us, a doctor becomes a better doctor, a teacher becomes a better teacher, a shop-keeper becomes a better shop-keeper, a manager becomes a better manager, a social servant becomes a better social servant etc. and thereby can lead a life of full and take the nation / civilization forward in the right direction. It is a win-win for all but requires no-deficit in attention and engagement.I grew up (Link) participating in study-circles where one week's discussion used to be an article from this monthly, Vivek-Jivan. The short and simple articles by respected Shri Nabaniharan Mukhopadhyaya, poupular as Nabani-da, in more than one ways cleared many a doubts of our young mind. There are several small booklets written by him on this central theme of Vivekananda. Many of them are available online now (link). Mahamandal works at grassroots in villages, towns, cities among 'ordinary' youth who embrace Vivekananda to garner confidence and build their own life. It apparently works below perceptible level and is thus not noticed by media. Even its annual camps during every Dec. 25-30 which is attended by over 1500 young man from all over the country under extreme hardship are not a news (Link). May be Mahamandal wants it that way, not to make flash-news but do the ground work that involves day to day grinding of building-up oneself and not to brag about it. I could find only two videos Nabanida in youtube which some camper recorded during Bengali Q & A session (Link1, Link2). With younger team taking over, now there is a facebook page (Link). However, since it is mostly rooted in villages and small cities working among struggling youths, the activity in facebook is mostly from city units and is thus less.When Vivek-Jivan editorial team asked one article from me in the anniversary issue, I tried to avoid as much as possible. I know the quality of the articles published there and the life and toil of the people who write them. I am no match. But soon the wish became a kind of order! And the following is the start of the article that I wrote. To read it in full, please visit this (Link). Thanks to Arunavada for necessary help. There is an error in my affiliation there. I am not 'Vice-President' :-) but a member of Kharagpur unit of Mahamandal.Vivekananda and Science : Some ObservationsWe associate childhood with innocence and a make-believe world. We cannot but be surprised when a child experiments with what his innocence asks him to believe. Let us begin with what a child showed us. One day, his mother arranged a congregation where a priest narrated the story of the mythological god, Hanuman, who was a close confidant of Lord Rama. The child heard that Hanuman conquered death and is also fond of banana. It did not take much time to establish a cause-effect relationship and the child was there in a banana garden and waited hours there to come face-to-face with immortal Hanuman. The elders in the family had a tough time to bring the child home. The argument that worked was – Lord Rama might have sent Hanuman to some other place for some important work. There were several hookahs, a kind of Indian smoking pipe, in their house. Each hookah was meant for people of a particular caste. Why so? The child was given the simple explanation that a person’s caste is lost if he smokes from the hookah of another caste. What happened next? The child tried all the hookahs by himself but could not find how his caste got lost. It was not so simple for the father to explain to the child about social stratification. No surprise that any round-about or evasive answer would not satisfy this child, Biley, when he attains youth as Narendra. His approach was straight and direct. ‘Have you seen God? Can you show me God?’ .... (continue)"},

Yesterday, Head of the Dept. who is aware of and encourages my association with students for social cause (Link1, Link2), had something to tell me. Yes, we do visit villages / slums in our attempt to get our students acquainted with howmajority of Indians live. Thereby, we gather some first hand experience on various issues. This includes the financial inclusion - how people save money and how they borrow money, the level of functional literacy and awareness, possibility of use of I.T. backbone (reaching up to Panchayet Office for sure) and telecommunication network etc. Head was asking me to write a post on this in my blog being moved by the recent 'chit fund' issue. I did not know that what I write primarily to address young population, was noted by seniors and they consider my writing worthy enough. I shall try to put my thoughts together on that issue and shall try to write down something. However, this post is to publicize three vacancies in our lab. for project positions which we want to fill quickly. The tenure of the project is two years. We have lost about three weeks of precious time in the project and walk-in-interview is considered the preferred way to fill at least some of the vacancies and get started with the project.We are hiring like this after two years. We consciously took a decision to go slow in taking responsibility of new projects till we serve our commitments to the existing projects to the satisfaction of the sponsors. Even then we are currently serving three plus one projects where I have major responsibilities. The plus-one is an inter-department project. The currently advertized project that attempts to reduce misuse of ultrasonography (USG) machines in sex-determination by tracking, is a big responsibility - not in terms of monetary value of the project but in terms of its direct social impact (besides NSS and NSO involvement). Besides the meeting I had with domain experts, the formulation of the project involved discussion with past and current students - the deficiencies of the solutions proposed so far, what we can do etc.. They will also contribute to the project in addition to the project staffs that we are hiring through this advertizement.We are looking for the right people to fill-up the vacancies.Some of the NSS (National Service Scheme), IIT Kharagpur students wanted to contribute. The following was observed in our discussion. The community service work IIT students perform through NSS helps them find their relation with the society. The benefit accrued to the society is mostly long-term and indirect in nature. The impression that is etched in the mind of the students as they perform their NSS service will have a bearing in whatever they do as they grow up in ladder and acquire higher positions of influence. A technology institute of higher learning like ours also gives opportunity to come up with solutions that can directly benefit the society now and here.EndnoteWe are happy to share that one of our recently developed prototype was considered among the 'Top 100' innovations by DST-Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Program 2013 (Link). This got a good review from international reviewers but could not make it to 'Top 50'. Our congratulations to 'Top 50' innovators and wish them our very best. We shall try to do better when we are ready with our next innovation. We see ourselves as serial innovator. We are clear in our mind not to form a start-up company or require funding as such  as our solution space is simple and low cost. But it is important for us to participate and get valuable feedback. We are good at algorithms, data crunching and interpretation. If we can harness that strength in any system level development by overcoming data acquisition related weakness, we can contribute more quantitatively and qualitatively."},
{"title": "The Writing", "date": "Wednesday, March 20, 2013", "text": "This year is celebrated as 150th birth anniversary of Vivekananda. Throughout the year there are various programs at IIT Kharagpur and in its different wings. I have some opportunity to engage in some of the activities related to youth and children. One such activity is school level competitions among various age groups in nearby villages / slums. I was going through the writing of Vivekananda, the prose and poetry, the biography to select competition materials. And what has been the experience? To pick up something for the children and youth becomes an exercise where I see plenty for grown-ups, facing life's competitions!What did we select for the schools? Make a guess.Or please wait till it gets posted in a different blog :-)Excerpts of a letter written to Sister Nivedita:One idea that I see clear as daylight is that misery is caused by ignorance and nothing else. Who will give the world light? Sacrifice in the past has been the Law, it will be, alas, for ages to come. The earth's bravest and best will have to sacrifice themselves for the good of many, for the welfare of all. Buddhas by the hundred are necessary with eternal love and pity.Religions of the world have become lifeless mockeries. What the world wants is character. The world is in need of those whose life is one burning love, selfless. That love will make every word tell like thunderbolt.It is no superstition with you, I am sure, you have the making in you of a world-mover, and others will also come. Bold words and bolder deeds are what we want. Awake, awake, great ones! The world is burning with misery. Can you sleep? Let us call and call till the sleeping gods awake, till the god within answers to the call. What more is in life? What greater work?The poem titled 'Hold on yet a while brave heart' (I remember that I memorized this poem for some competition when I was half this age and when somebody picked up this for us, at college level.)If the sun by the cloud is hidden a bit,If the welkin shows but gloom,Still hold on yet a while, brave heart,       The victory is sure to come.No winter was but summer came behind,Each hollow crests the wave,They push each other in light and shade;       Be steady then and brave.The duties of life are sore indeed,And its pleasures fleeting, vain,The goal so shadowy seems and dim,Yet plod on through the dark, brave heart,      With all thy might and main.Not a work will be lost, no struggle vain, Though hopes be blighted, powers gone;Of thy loins shall come the heirs to all,Then hold on yet a while, brave soul,      No good is e'er undone.Though the good and the wise in life are few,Yet theirs are the reins to lead,The masses know but late the worth;     Heed none and gently guide.With thee are those who see afar,With thee is the Lord of might,All blessings pour on thee, great soul,     To thee may all come right!A small poem:I look behind and afterAnd find that all is right,In my deepest sorrowsThere is a soul of light.Finally, excerpts from the poem, \"Quest for God\"O'ver hill and dale and mountain range,In temple, church, and mosque,In Vedas, Bible, Al KoranI had searched for Thee in vain.Like a child in the wildest forest lostI have cried and cried alone,\"Where art Thou gone, my God, my love?The echo answered, \"gone.\"Years then passed in bitter cry,Each moment seemed an age,Till one day midst my cries and groansSome one seemed calling me.When dire calamity seizes me,The heart seems weak and faint,All nature seems to crush me down,With laws that never bend.Meseems I hear Thee whispering sweetMy love, \"I am near\", \"I am near\".My heart gets strong. With thee, my love,A thousand deaths no fear.Thou speakest in the mother's layThou shuts the babies eye,When innocent children laugh and play,I see Thee standing by.When holy friendship shakes the hand,He stands between them too;He pours the nectar in mother's kissAnd the baby's sweet \"mama\".Thou wert my God with prophets old,All creeds do come from Thee,The Vedas, Bible, and Koran boldSing Thee in Harmony.\"Thou art,\" Thou art\" the Soul of soulsIn the rushing stream of life.\"Om tat sat om.\" Thou art my God,My love, I am thine, I am thine.P.S.: Liked the movie, \"The Tourist\". Liked its lack of excesses and calm resolute intelligence; the poise. Also, because it made me remember Venice, Venezia."},
{"title": "At Home", "date": "Sunday, March 3, 2013", "text": "Examination SeasonWe had a leisurely Sunday morning today. Daughter's exam. ends tomorrow. The only subject left belongs to mine! Yes, we have a division of labour at home. Half of the subjects are my responsibility. Her Highness was thus relieved since Saturday afternoon when the last exam. in her responsibility was over.Ignorance is bliss!As we parents struggle, the daughter is having a great fun. She read or heard somewhere that up to Class VI there is no 'pass' or 'fail' in school. Therefore, why worry about academics now? Knowledge gives power. Power to whom? Which knowledge? And the contradiction - knowledge of no pass / fail impeding persuasion of knowledge itself! Hope that we grown-ups do not succumb to this childish logic where we ourselves have a role of seekers.Fortune TellerYes, I was talking about Sunday morning! At home, people can find out when I have relatively more work pressure. The leisurely newspaper reading while sipping morning tea becomes the first casualty when under pressure. There is no prize for guessing the second casualty. It is shaving of beard. Such has been the case for past few weeks now. Even otherwise I do not have interest in the fortune-teller section of the newspaper. However, Her Highness reads newspaper in entirety that includes sections like advt., lost and found, anniversary, birth and death, lawyer's notice - what not. There are no less news in these if we are looking for a reflection of the society in our news basket from a newspaper. She was going through the astrology section and smilingly pronounced that I have a fortuitous week ahead.Extra Academic I don't know what fortune teller told about last week. Rewinding I find the following. On Monday, BSNL restored the broadband connection in a village high school where NSS, IIT Kharagpur works. This is a part of our prestigious project where RKMVU's VIVEKDISHA (Link) is getting implemented. On Tuesday, our alumni who are providing 50 scholarships to village / slum school students confirmed supporting 60 percent of the recurring cost. On Thursday, one colleague here assured support of another 20 percent. On Friday, could not turn down the request of another neighbourhood village high school. Spent an hour and had lunch with them on their picnic that involved 1200 students and teachers. The Wednesdays and Saturdays are special now for the Health and Fitness (NSO) program. Need to put some extra effort as it is a new launch. The NSS activities took some extra effort this week for the preparatory work of intra and inter-village school competitions to be held in this month with final winner declaration on 6th April, 2013, in the NSS Annual Day function.AcademicOn Wednesday, learnt that ours is the project selected from the institute for the First SIG meeting on \"VAS and its policies\" at New Delhi in the Technology Innovation segment. On Thursday, the reviewer of ISRO asked us to go ahead with the project proposal submitted to them. The same day we heard that fund for a no ordinary project (Link) is released. This project is one where we can see social impact almost immediately and each day counts. Immediately alerted people who will be joining our team when fund comes. Coming Wednesday we have an important technical session on this. On Friday, the senior PhD student told that our paper is accepted for presentation in the most prestigious conference in our domain ICASSP 2013. The same day got another invitation with subject line, \"Entrepreneurial Event of National Innovation Foundation at Rashtrapati Bhavan\". This was for another technology innovation of our lab. which was a winner at national level. And on Thursday royalty for the books coauthored was received, not princely but not insignificant too, compared to our annual salary! I need to do something to accelerate the next single authored book project which is supposed to have two editions, one in India and the other in another country; the publisher is asking about the progress beyond first chapter : - ( Yes, we are eligible for sabbatical for projects like this but ... well, politely refused a request received on Monday from outside that would have taken some time from summer vacation; on Tuesday requested one administrative head of the institute not to take the proposal further for a large institute level admin. responsibility.Future CareerAs it happens every week, attended many meetings as a part of administrative responsibility at institute and dept. level. Conducted important study and prepared comparative statement on purchase matters. Helped correcting errors. Discussed results with three research students whose work is ripe for communication to journals. Provided research material / slides to institute representative for institute level presentation at another IIT, meeting students outside classroom and guardians.... and the list goes on. However, if my daughter wants to take faculty position like me as her future career, it is not the excitement associated with the job. She thinks that it is always party time for us! We go to institute, take ten classes a week i.e. ten hours and rest of our time goes into gossip with friends in tea shop. In campus socials, she has seen that we colleagues are good friends and having fun among ourselves. And it got extrapolated!OverwhelmedI was honoured to have an invitation from a very senior faculty member of the Management Dept. this week. He was not only inquisitive but also heard with rapt attention for hours how we work as a team  in NSS (Link) and NSO (Link) program that now cater to 1850 undergraduate students of 1st and 2nd year. He asked me to write a paper to a prestigious journal as the management philosophy employed has lots of novelty. To have an appreciation from a senior management faculty like him was enough for me! He understood my weakness and affectionately told that he would write it for me. I was overwhelmed.HumbledThe Shcholars' Avenue (Link), the campus newspaper run by the students, conducted an interview some days back. This was published online on Saturday. I am humbled, was speechless for sometime, reading the title they have given for the interview (Link). I don't know if there can be any greater honour, greater humbling experience than an association with \"Dedicated to the service of the nation\", the red neon light in institute main building that beckons all of us.Pray that I be worthy of all these.The HypothesisIt is very simple. Vivekananda says, \"When Adam fell, he fell from Purity. Thus, Purity is our real nature.\" or \"Each person is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest that divinity in every walk of life.\" Divinity is not anything complex or high philosophy stuff. A person who thinks of his/her own due and does not bother for the due of others is animalistic in character. A person who thinks of his/her own due as well as that of others is human in character. A person who does not worry about his/her own due and think of due of others is divine in character. We believe it or not, our selfish skin is to adapt to the nature and deficiencies. Beneath it rests our unselfish self and how true is this, \"You show me an unselfish person and I will show you God.\" We remain selfish due to our over-dependence or over-emphasis on nature and lack of confidence in our own self, our inability to listen to our own voice.By nature, our students here are disciplined, hard working, focused, full of concentration, intelligent, talented. Without that they would not have made their entry into IIT Kharagpur. It is already in them. The effort is to make them not forget that and build further, so that they feel stronger, happier and do good to themselves, their family, the society. It is Sunday!Too much of serious stuff for a holiday post! Unpardonable! Let's come back to the leisurely tea session of Sunday morning and the fortune-teller column. Once I thought of telling Her Highness the detail of the previous week and if she had an inkling of it from last Sunday's fortune column of newspaper. Then thought why ruin the holiday morning! A 'good-for-nothing' husband role suits the best at home : - )EndnoteThis week got confirmation from two hotels of Haridwar and Rishikesh where one week of summer vacation is planned. This is the 3rd, 2nd and 1st visit to these places for us in decreasing order of age. Train reservation was confirmed earlier. There was another good thing about this week compared to previous week. There was no mopping job at home as our domestic help was available all seven days!!!"},
{"title": "Looking Back", "date": "Monday, January 28, 2013", "text": "'Backlog' is a dreaded word. But many of us prefer to read a novel at one go or at least by chapters and not by pages or paragraphs. And this keeps asking for a space. Things start piling up. Dots in this leg of the journey do not add up. Let me scribble something here which I can quickly recollect.NSS Annual CampThe seven day long NSS Camp (Start link) experience was something I wanted to write about. Young first year students UG students, 500+ of them spending 7 days in countryside doing activities like widening of road, bush-cleaning, filling-up of potholes, organizing cloth distribution to needy, conducting awareness rally, cultural program, learning team work, plain living. It was great to spend 7 days with the students and was happy to see the smile, the joy in their faces. The feedback received (Link) from young campers show why we should be believing.RGUKT IIIT Basara visitI am not doing justice by not writing a separate post on this visit, so overwhleming was the experience! There was an official work. But visiting an engineering college campus and not interacting with students - nay, it cannot made to happen! The 8:30 PM full-house student interaction was more than interesting. The emails received from some of those students post-visit are thought provoking, serious and sincere. No praise is enough for the excellent discipline in 7000 strong campus where devotion to academics is integrated with life and culture. The college is the first of its kind in admitting meritorious, rural youth after Class X Board examination. The teaching and hostel is completely free. Not only that, dress is also provided by Andhra Pradesh Government. More of this college can be found here (Link).The CallWe usually call SDO, BDO in our effort to enrich young IIT Kharagpur students with community service experience. They often grace our functions where local village community and our students perform together (Link1, Link2). And the call came. First from SDO and then from BDO of Kharagpur-II block. There was an issue with a tribal village where scientific investigation was needed, besides assuring tribal community who can be superstitious on the issue related. And they thought of us. It was an honour and privilege. We rushed to the spot with BDO office staff and interacted with the community, explained them and gave our recommendation to the district authority. It was first such experience and thus very special (Link).ABVYM Annual CampAfter IIIT Basara visit, was occupied with answer-script checking and other admin. responsibilities. Then came ABVYM Annual Camp (Link) during Dec. 25-30, 2013. This time it was held in Basantapur Jhareshwar School, Sabong, abut 40 KM from here. Young men from all over India, about 1600 in number, poured into the village school. The six day camp dwelt on man-making, character-building ideas of Vivekananda whose birthday is observed as National Youth Day. The campers had to bring their own bedding, lie on floor of school building, take food which is the simplest possible, manage in an infrastructure with limited no. of toilets and other amenities, follow strict discipline - compulsorily get up by 4:50 AM (flag-hoisting everyday at 5:40 AM), participate in all camp activities that include guard duty at night when mercury was at its lowest in the season. No travel allowance or daily allowance is paid. Instead a camp fee (Rs. 150-200 per camper) is charged. \"Why take so much hardship? What do you gain from it?\" A group of IIT Kharagpur students asked some of the campers when they paid a brief visit to the camp site. And the answers from a beaming 3rd Year Chemical Engineering student from Vizag or a young school teacher of a Bankura village told the same - such a camp recharges them, re-energizes them in increasing their resolve to be a better human being for a better society. The motto is \"Be and Make\" where the word \"Be\" comes first and that is the most important. National Service Scheme (NSS) motto, \"Not Me, But You\" was discussed with the campers.Five in contextThere are people for whom if you do five and not the rest ninety five, they remember the five you have done. I cannot but feel embarrassed when local village high schools conduct annual function and print invitation card with my name as chief guest. I have already attended two such this year. Today, the headmaster of another high school called and told about their annual function. I try to attend as it develops bonding and our students can engage themselves in community service work and benefit from the experience. Many of our students are very popular among village school students for the Saturday classes they held. In two high schools we are trying to launch Vivek Disha, an online class, with the help of RKMVU (Link). We shall link this experience later once it goes through.Lift and PushTo get it back in to track, a carriage has to be lifted. Once it is on track, push is enough unless it gets derailed. It had been very satisfying to get something into track and leave it at a stage when it seems that push is enough. Am always around if it gets derailed for some reason. And the time and energy can be utilized in any other job that requires a lift. And the time has come.What else?The Tata Steel slogan of yesteryear can be remembered, \"We also make steel.\" It is life as usual. Notable is to file three IPs in last month. They were nearly ready. It needed the '100 Days, 100 Patents' drive to complete the documentation process and subsequent filing by patent attorney. We have shared the details with one Hyderabad based company who were talking to us since PanIIT meet. Yes, completed proof-checking and indexing of new edition of one of the title. It was a laborious job but a textbook always needs care in preparation. Two sponsored projects ended with nice remarks from funding agencies. Two big projects of national importance are in the pipeline. Delhi, Bangalore - one has a big societal impact, the other is to serve those who serve us without caring for their own life - lots of responsibility, but as some of my colleagues say, I am blessed with research students who are serious and sincere. What more does one want?"},
{"title": "Switching Task", "date": "Monday, November 19, 2012", "text": "I wished to continue with the fun spirit of earlier post or wait for a sunny day that would have brightened the spirit (switch to last segment to see why I say this). Wished to tell in the same non-serious tone that the worst I feared as outcome of 'Mission Independence' (Link) had happened; after cooking food and eating the same for one week. I gained one kilogram of weight. Yes, there used to be wrong estimate on quantity of rice. But, more important reason had been, couldn't throw away any food even if it was in excess and swallowed the same. Can do that easily when someone else puts her effort in cooking, to set aside excess food-stuff when I am full. Which part of our brain plays the trick, fools us ... develops attachment for own doings even when it is beyond proportion defying all logic?We three colleagues were on our way to Kolkata. How to handle work pressure, various expectations was one of the topic in our journey. The wonderful teacher-student relationship, the respect IIT teachers command from students are largely due to devotion the students see among teachers, the amount of effort, the hours they put in, the multitudes of responsibilities they handle.IITs started with an aim of providing right manpower to industries in post-independence era. UG teaching was the focus. The brand it created asks not to disown this family jewel. But the world has moved on. UG engineering teaching is taken care of by many. The focus is getting shifted to PG students (Masters and PhD guidance other than their coursework). But we do not have postdocs in our research lab.s. Thus, the canvas of the role of a teacher is huge (UG to PhD, taking care of academic and psychological needs of students from 18 year old to 30 year old in a walled campus). It encompasses interaction within and outside classroom, assignments, answer-script checking and other evaluations, minor and major projects ...Getting funded projects and servicing them as per timeline and to the satisfaction of sponsors through project staffs coming from Tier-2 engineering colleges is a challenge. IIT faculty are supposed to serve various national level responsibilities by conducting various training programs for others, setting question papers of various kinds, serving various committees, evaluating and guiding funded projects conducted by others, establishing lab.s, setting curriculum etc.There are review work for thesis, journal, conference articles, patent documents. There are recommendations to be given to current as well as ex-students applying to various places. There are research collaboration at national and international level and one needs to interact with collaborators, visit their places, host them.  There are large no. of administrative responsibilities at Dept., Institute level and beyond. Some faculty members contribute by writing text/research books for which they have commitment to publishers and need to adhere to publication timeline. For IPs filed, one needs to explore commercialization opportunities.Besides, in a rapidly changing technology space one needs to study oneself to keep one updated as regard to UG/PG courses being taught, the research work carried out by leading universities / lab.s / industry in his area of interest and the broad area.Finally, they have a family to take care. They have passion for extra-curricular and society at large. They cannot take their health for granted. And they have 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week like everybody else :-)How to switch from one task to another? Remember, you are handling youth, the best and brightest of the country, and the nation banks on them. One cannot be casual in one's approach. An insincere job will be hugely costly for the nation. Standing by each other, encouraging / motivating each other, sharing the vision and experience, building team spirit, excellence in work environment and the highly sought after freedom, friendly and supportive atmosphere are behind whatever little that could be done to face these challenges.Thanks to all. The first and foremost is of course our excellent student community. No amount of praise is enough. If there is any aberration, it has more to do with inability to set a new goal once they enter IIT. Cracking IIT-JEE was dream from childhood. What next? Faculty, Parents, Alumni, Senior students, all need to work together to help the young 18 year old set the next goal, the next dream, and how to achieve it; switching to a new role and task. Next, parents / guardians have great respect for IIT system which helps. But there is more scope for them to engage with faculty advisor and monitor progress from 1st semester itself. Call it parent-teacher meeting akin to schools, call it any other thing - but they are important stake holders and are in a position to influence. We can sow dreams in them too, how much their ward can do and they can inspire / motivate in turn. The faculty and non-faculty colleagues are excellent. If someone does not feel the pressure, it is because of them. There is always a helping hand. People who are part of the support system who are drawn from neighbourhood - shopkeepers, maids, service staffs from electrical maintenance to sanitary have such a pleasing personality; it makes our job easier. No amount of 'Thanks' is sufficient for family members. They understand, appreciate our responsibilities. Rarely you will hear, \"You have time to take care of others but your own kid.\"On individual plane, I find that the lessons on Pratyhara and Dharana from study circles are helpful. An excellent article of Vivekananda can be found here (Link). The article is useful for everyone who wants mastery over mind and its various tricks.For quite sometime I wanted to write something on changing social structure, family values ... desire for personal space, better things in life ... losing grip over of patience, tolerance .... the idea of 'self before everything else' ... till sometime back separated parents fought each other over custody of child, the other day the newspaper reported a case where none of the parents wants custody of the child as they separate (Link1, Link2)... it started with nuclear family concept which kept uncles, aunt out; then ageing father / mother were kept out; then husband wife stopped seeing each other, and now off-springs are obstacles to have 'good times' in life  ... it appears that, the younger a person, the more is the ease and pace to disown a relationship and disregard advice / suggestion / feedback, the ego is higher ... it is so sad, it is so painful in the land where 'sacrifice' and 'service' were the twin pillars which held the society together ... need to ask, what we are getting educated at, are we not ignoring those family jewels ... can we call ourselves educated ... Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and runs riot there .... The training by which the current and expression of will is brought under control and become fruitful is called education ... says Vivekananda. My elder sister says that there were always challenges. But tolerance level was higher to tide over a crisis phase which is cyclic in nature. Now we have become more fragile. The relationships are casualty. We have breadth, but we lack in depth. We have knowledge, we lack wisdom. We are after Preya (pleasure driven) and not Shreya (welfare driven). We look for maximizing today, we do not care for investing in tomorrow. We care for matter, we do not care for spirit.May we develop the strength of character which stands the trials of life, the test of time. May we all be blessed to overcome challenges being humane in our approach. May we be at peace with ourselves and society around."},
{"title": "Mission Independence", "date": "Tuesday, October 30, 2012", "text": "/* Nothing official about it. Believe it at your own risk :-) Reader's discretion wanted! */I was duly warned by one research student. The serious look that went with the cautionary words told it all. I should not take it lightly.It was well past Durga Puja. Dashami was on WED. And I planned to prepone return to campus on FRI. A truck load of work was pending. For Her Highness, it was mission independence in some sense after four and half months, to visit parents, much in the spirit of Ma Durga on Shashthi day (SAT) when bodhan takes place. There are differences between then and now. Durga returned from parental home on Dashami. Here, it would be one week later as daughter's school will remain closed for one more week. The dependence from our side to have an orderly house, to keep us giving our best in competitive IIT environment, is the other difference. Even if we afford to keep a disorderly house in the absence of Durgas at home who manage everything with ten hands, how will the lunch, dinner be arranged? The answer would be - Can you not manage few days in neighbourhood restaurants, thereby giving Durgas much needed relief?The voice within said that. And I forgot to pay heed to the unambigous warning of my research student. Landed in KGP on FRI evening. The Durga Puja break was up to SUN. And I found to my horror after a tiring train journey, all the neighbourhood restaurants were shut. The make shift dinner of egg-chowmin from a fast food centre came to rescue the evening. But two more days, SAT-SUN to go! And I told myself, \"Enough is enough!\" It is time to launch Mission Independence.Mission Independence! Roti, Kapda aur Makan - only the Roti part is the cause of this ruin. Before this, I cooked food twice. At home, the charge is handed over from Mother to Daughter-in-law in due process. And this makes us spoiled. The first time I cooked was decades back when Ma was in charge.  She was then visiting Mamabari, her paternal place. I was enjoying delicacies in neighbourhood Hari Hotel of Golebazar, Kharagpur. It is still there on station road, much improved. Has to be. One should remember the likes of the persons who stepped in there! I am not talking about me. Some of the one day meet of Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal had lunch arrangement there. One fine morning, prepared egg-curry and it was so good that I decided not to venture again to do anything below that benchmark! Not only that, took that curry in a tiffin carrier and wasting no time traveled 5 hours (two trains) to Mamabari to show my detractors there how good I was at cooking. Made everybody taste a little of that curry.The second venture was during Trento and USC days in 2006! You cannot afford 25 US dollars per day for food, more so when you have the habit of converting everything to rupee value in early weeks. And never there after. Conveniently forgot cooking when either Ma or Her Highness was there at charge; restaurants filling up the gaps, if any.But it was different this time. Expressed my desire to cook food to Her Highness in FRI evening briefing. One should know that twice a day briefing is must to keep up with the updates, specially the gossip part at either end! And she started screaming hearing my Mission Independence and asked me to look for restaurants in a larger radius. She was more worried about the condition of her beloved kitchen, the disorderliness I would unleash there, so on and so forth. But I was determined. Mental preparation for the Mission is done.Recipe were noted over phone. Correlated them with remnants in memory from USC days. Ran youtube videos for several times. Her Highness was almost in tears to think about what is going to happen in the kitchen. To assure, I said that my lazy self might not allow me finally to go for it and I might look for a restaurant outside campus. Going by my past record in taking responsibility at home. she felt relieved.And I decided to play aggressive and not just depend on singles. The cauliflower, beans, potato, tomato, dhaniapata curry was followed by no less than chicken curry. Preparation of rice was a cake walk in comparison. And it was not a one day wonder like one film hero. The cabbage preparation of yesterday evening tasted even better. Now, even when the restaurants are open, I am not venturing out for dinner and preparing it at home. Such is the fragrance of independence!Her Highness told that the sister-in-law would take a test soon on my cooking ability. I have nothing to prove to anybody. Such thought is more than over-confidence. It is arrogance. May be I can conduct a trial before that here, at least with chicken curry, a kind of lab. level test. Don't know who will dare to eat that. But I have great faith in my research students. My colleagues say that I am blessed  to have such a wonderful research team. I overstepped their warning on availability of food during Durga Puja break. The overstepping has gone quite a far. I am sure that they will maintain the tradition of saving me as they always do from nightmares when review team of sponsored projects tells, Enough of fun / it's time to test / what you have done.Is there anything called independence? Independence from what? If I am dependent on ABC, I am not independent. In turn, if ABC is dependent on me then too, I am not independent. Confused? So am I."},
{"title": "Joy of giving week", "date": "Sunday, October 7, 2012", "text": "We are in the joy of giving week. Bhagabad Gita talks about two types of giving - 'enlightened giving' and 'selfish giving'. What is enlightened giving? \"Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is enlightened giving.\" How many of us are having enlightened life - partial, if not fully; at least sympathy, if not empathy? Still we give. We must. There is no escape. \"Life is short. The vanities of the world are transient.\" Most of us try to overlook this axiom of life and live a life of denial, denial of fundamental principles, denial of truth - that death is inevitable, we have to leave behind all that what we considered precious, none will go with me. Not only that. The fool in us believes that we can fool others, even God when we give something, which is not exactly giving. It is Lord Krishna himself who defined selfish-giving long before. \"Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favour or of getting something in return, is selfish giving.\" And there is no joy in it. Please read the article given in the link, specially the anecdote towards the end of the article (Link).I am not an economist. I know little about administration. I know that decision making is not easy for an administrator. Those who have to decide are not in an enviable position. There are so many things to balance - inflation, fiscal deficit, growth rate, interest rate, poverty alleviation schemes, aspiration of vocal section of the community, our honest desire or demand, our not-so-honest ones too (why not if I can get it as a bargain, aren't others doing the same? - that goes the logic) and we are not living in isolation, there is a foreign policy of the country and there may be pressure on that count too. The selfish individual in us asks us to take decisions which nourishes my own interest, my constituency (if I am a teacher, I shall look for best deal in pay commission; if I am a businessman, I shall look for more concession for my products and services etc.), at least I should not get less than what I get now in the name of greater good. Are we not ourselves entitled to have good things in life? But we can call ourselves human being if we think that, what is due to us is due to others too. And a person is godly if (s)he thinks of what is due to others and not his/her own.It is so very important for us to cultivate unselfishness if we are in a decision making role. Even if we take an unpleasant decision for long term good which gives short term pain, our thoughts and words, our body language should reflect that pain. And there is a matching sacrifice on my part too. I also embrace the difficulties shared by others. Joy of giving is not just donating money or clothes. Joy of giving relates to practising unselfishness in my day to day life, in my profession, in the decisions I make that affects the life of people. Joy of giving week (02-08 Oct.) starts with birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. Do we remember what he said? \"Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to him.\"The word Mahatma reminds how Vivekananda categorized 'Mahatma' (great soul) and 'duratma' (wicked soul), two opposite poles. \"Him I call a Mahatma whose heart bleeds for the poor, otherwise he is Duratma. So long as millions live in hunger and ignorance I hold every man traitor who while educated at their expense (just not formal education, nourishment of all kinds provided by the society), pays not the least heed to them\".The much talked about 3 'H' - Heart (ability to feel), Head (ability to think, work out a solution), Hand (ability to implement) are not just indices of individual development. Individuals make nation. As a nation, do we have a heart to feel for the poor and underprivileged, do we put our thinking cap on and use our collective wisdom to strategize that take development far and corner, do we care for the gaps, loopholes in the implementation and give our shoulder to the wheel to improve delivery mechanism so that each citizen feels that nation cares, nation loves, nation tries.The joy of giving week will be more than symbolic if we start a reform process that brings out our unselfish best in the way we think and act.***                                      ***                                      ***                                          ***The first picture of this post is that of a NSS, IIT Khargpur volunteer. In this week, they arranged a blood donation camp in a village school to spread awareness. There was a sudden power cut and it extended beyond an hour. But the spirit was indomitable. The bed was brought out in the verandha  (corridor) which was more airy. And the activity continued. The student donor tried his best so that his fellow student does not take the trouble of fanning him during this power cut. The second picture shows what is called leading by example by the NSS unit faculty, also an acclaimed young professor of Computer Science and Engineering Dept. of IIT Kharagpur, a winner of prestigious IBM Faculty award this year. There were many other students including students from other NSS unit donating blood there. Our in campus blood donation took place in April, 2012. The third picture demonstrates what service means. Can we be bridge ourselves over which people can cross the river of suffering? Salutation to this spirit of service of our young jawans. Proud of you.Yesterday there was a scholarship examination conducted at all village schools for PRERANA scholarships donated by senior IIT Khaargpur students. Two students from each of the fourteen primary schools get it. Four - six students from each of the three village high schools too get the same. These are the places where our young students work once a week for 2-4 hours. There was also a small meeting held in a village yesterday where NSS faculty explained the virtues of Kissan Credit Card (KCC). The interest taken for farming by money-lenders in this village is Rs. 100 per Rs. 1000 per month which amounts to 100% compounded monthly. The KCC loan interest is about Rs 3.5 to Rs. 6 per Rs. 1000 per months (4% if paid in time, 7% if delayed) and the farmers were so delighted to learn this. It is interesting to note that a village community leader told the gathering that the bank would take away land if interest is not paid, as if the money lender charging 15-25 times more interest would not mind in similar case!! The crop insurance is other component attached to KCC which can be availed without KCC too.Bottom line is that a lot can be done even within the present scheme of things if we care for giving - our time, energy, resource; remain engaged and this will make every week of us joyful."},

The morning at Chennai, afternoon at Delhi and evening at Kolkata - well, this is when we are enjoying a break :-) when the students are occupied with mid-sem. exam.Day long meeting, hectic schedule, long hours on travel from one part of the country to the other part, sleep deprivation - all take back seat when you find that your work, the effort you have put behind in the preparation, getting appreciated....and you get opportunities to contribute more.The Dreamliner flight on AI 430 from Chennai to Delhi was of course a sweet surprise. The look and feel was world class. More surprise was on store to find a four year old wonder at Delhi airport. I knew the father, an ex-student, an IIT-IIM, would be there in spite of my advice not to take trouble during his office hour. He is in-charge of supply-chain management of a big MNC food chain, reminded him of his responsibility and asked him not to get emotional. But I failed! Didn't expect the kid there who looked and talked like the mother. The mother too had been an ex-student, an HR professional now, was at Mumbai during the day for delivering a talk at TISS. Previous evening, it was she who called to thank for the little help I could offer on her preparation of this talk. And they found that I was paying a short visit to Delhi.Invigilation duty for the exam., discharging administrative responsibilities of various kind, getting feedback from publisher at India as well as USA (looking for simultaneous launch by both US and Indian arm) on sample chapter of the new text book, single authored - both inspiration and perspiration :-), receiving the proofs of all the chapters for newer edition of an earlier title .... eventful week.Conducted a mid-sem feedback exercise from students for the theory course following standard procedure. A total of 102 students participated. Ninety percent of them were appreciative of the effort. About 10 percent did not find it that useful. At places, the weakness pointed out by this 10 percent was termed as strength by members of the other group!!! Much to the disappointment of those who discourages students from attending classes and enjoy their college life :-) more than ninety percent opined that attending the class was essential. Half of this population (> 45 %) told that it is 'highly essential'.I end this post with what I wanted to be when I stand between young students and a subject. The following was written by few students in the feedback. The day when I shall be able to present myself as both friendly and strict / serious (strictness for the benefit of the students and the academic environment / ecosystem; being talented is not enough, discipline and purpose are key), to all and not just a few, I can consider myself worthy enough to be called a teacher and not one who is making a career out of academic engagement.\"Highly interactive, .... who is really friendly with students, yet strict when it comes to academics, relevance and good examples to recent technologies. / Strong background in subject, interactive, respects student idea and thoughts / Stimulating, stress on self-thinking, real-life examples / Teacher is highly motivated, his motivation is reflected in the way he teaches. Encourages students, involves. / Competitive environment in class, students are encouraged to ask questions / The teaching method encourages us to think and explore more. / Friendly environment, helpful, forwards academic and non-academic matters, good subject knowledge, excellent teacher.\"Three students in the feedback asked for break / rest when there is a double lecture (110 minutes). While discussing this feedback in the class and how I am going to address the suggestions offered by the students, in rest of the semester, I used the quote of Swami Swarupananda given in the beginning of the post. He, a Karmayogi, (check picks here) told in Bengali - Karyantare jaoai Bishram. That our students are up to the task can be seen from mail given below. The work was completely optional at student end, given that it is exam. week. In fact, I told them not to worry about this when exam. for theory subjects are going on.From: XYZDate: Wed, Sep 26, 2012 at 6:47 PMSubject: [NSS] Monthly Report - SeptemberTo: nsscentralteam@googlegroups.comDear Sir,The last of the 4 back-to-back exams I have this week will be tomorrow (i.e. THU). My next and last exam will be on Monday.

{"title": "Nine Eleven", "date": "Tuesday, September 11, 2012", "text": "In my school days or studentship at IIT Kharagpur, we used to celebrate 11th September as Chicago Day, the day Vivekananda delivered his first address in the Parliament of Religion at Columbus hall, Chicago, America in 1893. The world heard, \"we accept all religions as true\", the triumph of human quest  and character beyond borders and beliefs. We heard or did we? \"Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now. But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honor of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.\"In the concluding session of this Parliament of Religion, we heard, \"Much has been said of the common ground of religious unity. I am not going just now to venture my own theory. But if any one here hopes that this unity will come by the triumph of any one of the religions and the destruction of the others, to him I say, \"Brother, yours is an impossible hope.\" Do I wish that the Christian would become Hindu? God forbid. Do I wish that the Hindu or Buddhist would become Christian? God forbid.The seed is put in the ground, and earth and air and water are placed around it. Does the seed become the earth, or the air, or the water? No. It becomes a plant. It develops after the law of its own growth, assimilates the air, the earth, and the water, converts them into plant substance, and grows into a plant.Similar is the case with religion. The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor a Hindu or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to his own law of growth.\"And there cannot be greater truth than this. \"If the Parliament of Religions has shown anything to the world, it is this: It has proved to the world that holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character.

I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world; I thank you in the name of the mother of religions, and I thank you in the name of millions and millions of Hindu people of all classes and sects.My thanks, also, to some of the speakers on this platform who, referring to the delegates from the Orient, have told you that these men from far-off nations may well claim the honor of bearing to different lands the idea of toleration. I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true. I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth. I am proud to tell you that we have gathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites, who came to Southern India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holy temple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny. I am proud to belong to the religion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation. I will quote to you, brethren, a few lines from a hymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest boyhood, which is every day repeated by millions of human beings: \"As the different streams having their sources in different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee.\" The present convention, which is one of the most august assemblies ever held, is in itself a vindication, a declaration to the world of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita: \"Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me.\" Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now. But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honor of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.Sept. 27, 1893The World's Parliament of Religions has become an accomplished fact, and the merciful Father has helped those who laboured to bring it into existence, and crowned with success their most unselfish labour.My thanks to those noble souls whose large hearts and love of truth first dreamed this wonderful dream and then realized it. My thanks to the shower of liberal sentiments that has overflowed this platform. My thanks to this enlightened audience for their uniform kindness to me and for their appreciation of every thought that tends to smooth the friction of religions. A few jarring notes were heard from time to time in this harmony. My special thanks to them, for they have, by their striking contrast, made general harmony the sweeter. Much has been said of the common ground of religious unity. I am not going just now to venture my own theory. But if any one here hopes that this unity will come by the triumph of any one of the religions and the destruction of the others, to him I say, \"Brother, yours is an impossible hope.\" Do I wish that the Christian would become Hindu?

{"title": "Inheritance", "date": "Sunday, September 9, 2012", "text": "Today is the death anniversary of my father. A 2010 post on Baba appears here (Link). Every time I think of him, the responsibility he carried on his shoulder and made his service available to our extended family and beyond family and  even under difficult times, I get to hear that I must do much, much, more to be considered a worthy son. One of my friend from those days, a JNU PhD, now a faculty member in a college under Calcutta University and doing wonderful work there in NSS, was accompanying me today in my car. He saw father's picture in photo stand there. And told that Baba must have felt proud for me as he could see that I had completed IIT education though he missed seeing me an IIT faculty member.My friend expressed happiness that my mother is around. What my friend did not know that Baba was more concerned with development as a whole and he was among the first few guardian who patronized the start of Kharagpur unit of Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal (Link) in the seventies. I remember him speaking in some of the functions of the Unit in those days. If I behaved wayward anytime, the medicine that always worked :-),  him saying, \"This is what you are learning visiting Mahamandal (its children unit).\" The child in me used to retreat by saying, \"Tell me whatever you want to say. Don't say anything bad about Mahamandal.\" And he used to smile at that. In academics, he always believed in putting the best effort and never bothered about my ranking, final performance. Not only me, all who came in contact with him, miss this reassuring personality. He had been an inspiration, a source of strength for people of different ages and background. He always had something to encourage people to go forward and do better.Youth Training CampThe major part of the day was spent in a training camp of young people on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Vivekananda. It was held in Traffic Ramakrishna Vivekananda Society, Kharagpur, organized by Kharagpur unit of Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal. About 170 young people from schools and colleges of Kharagpur as well as neighbourhood places like Jharagram, Khakurda, Lalat etc. participated. Ranjitda took 4:15 AM from Naihati in the morning to reach camp at 9:30 AM. He was the main speaker. I spoke little towards the end in the 3:30 PM question-answer session.Unselfishness is GodRanjitda was saying that there is debate on existence of God. But we see God everyday whenever we see an act of unselfishness. Vivekananda said, \"Unselfishness is God.\" And this we see when we see our parents. We just think of the sacrifice they make for our well-being with always prayer for us in lips - if we cannot see them as god, there must be a problem with our vision.Subhash Chandra Bose of 14 yearsRanjitda talked about 14 year old (Netaji) Subhash Chandra Bose. Subhash was writing letters to his mother. In one he expressed anxiety on academic issues as he was loosing focus due to issues associated with adolescence (In Bengali, \"Bayaser dharma peye bosechhe\"). And in that letter he is asking mother to give him strength.Good Student or Good Boy?The letter of this 14 year lad had something which only can come from someone who the country will call \"Netaji\" soon. On receiving scholarship after doing well in a competitive exam., he visualizes happy faces of parents, the celebration at home and in the locality. But Subhash writes that he himself is not happy. He says that his life will be successful when the mother will say, \"Subhash is just not a good student but a good boy. (In Bengali, Subhash shudhu bhalo chhatro noi, bhalo chhele.)\" A 14 year lad making the distinction between 'good student' and 'good boy' after doing well in an competitive exam. A campus that houses thousands of good students may do well to listen to young Subhash, his aspiration, what means success for him, the mother's 'good boy' certificate, the 'good student' certificate is not enough!Life is a mission, a duty : Distinction between happiness and enjoymentSubhas Chandra asked mother what sort of career for her children would please her most?-whether she would be the happiest if her children in later life became the judges, magistrates, barristersor high-placed officials and came to be admired for wealth and fortune by the men of the world, or if they could earn the respect of the learned and the virtuous for having grown up to be 'real men' even though they might be poor. At the same age in a letter to one of his classmates, Subhas Chandra wrote: 'My life is not for my own enjoyment. My life is of course not devoid of happiness but is not for enjoyment-my life is a mission-a duty.'Finding a son at pension officeRanjitda talked about one Kallol, a dedicated Govt. worker for whom work is truly service. Before joining once Kallol happened to see old people waiting for long hours for disbursal of pension at the beginning of every month. Instead of 10 AM, the counter used to open at 12:30 PM and that too for a short period, with lot of harassment to senior citizens. Interestingly, he got a job in pension office after 5 years and even if it meant working extra hours in the evening, he always completed the job so that the pension can be disbursed in time. The first day when he assumed office and started disbursal, hours before the late 12:30 PM schedule maintained earlier, the elderly people were not believing. And they tried to reach out to Kallol's head with their feeble hand offering blessings, the iron grill of the counter coming in between. Be it a family function like marriage or disease like fever, Kallol was never absent during pension days so that the elderly disabled people get their dues in time.Mind and its controlJagadishda who came from Narayangarh beautifully explained \"Mind and its control.\" How difficult is to control mind so that we can put it into something at our will as well as take it off!.  Mind is compared with a monkey who as such is restless, in addition it is intoxicated (by desire, lust), bitten by a scorpion (by envy), on whom a demon sits (which is ego). Arjun, the great warrior too said that the mind is too strong to be controlled, it is easier to hold air in one's fist. However, Krishna acknowledged the same but assured that there is a way. What is it? Abhyas and Bairagya. Abhyas is striving, doing it again and again. Bairagya is disenchantment with whatever is bad. Vyasa says that mind as a river that can flow in both the directions. If one goes by the current of Viveka, the conscience, the flow is in the direction of virtue. Then he talked about Yam, Niyam, Asana, Pratyahar and Dharana (Link) as a proven method of control of mind and making the most of this tool.100 Days 100 PatentsLeft the camp little early to attend patent workshop at S. N. Bose Auditorium which is a part of ambitious \"100 Days 100 Patents\" drive by the institute (Link). Seeing the enthusiasm, our Director said that he had been skeptic at the beginning but feels confident now. On 7th Sept., there was a curtain raiser in which Dean, Sponsored Research told an anecdote that he heard. The moral had been : We spend 25% our effort in constructive things and 75% of mind remains in some state of agitation for problems within or outside. If we can inverse this ratio, we can do much better, given the capacity we have. Team effort as it has been, even for our small contribution, we had been called on stage to light up the lamp. Feel honoured. The workshop had talk from patent controller, patent attorney, case studies, The Q & A session was very live. About 30 abstracts were submitted today itself. Expect that the momentum will continue. One faculty colleague who is an expert in patent law was crisp in his observation to explain the potential loss for innovations being published in non-patentable documents. He was worried about IP rights not being vested properly to institute, the opportunities missed and came up with, \"The previous century said - Publish or perish. The current century says - Publish and perish.\"Father of PGM holderRemembering father reminds me the visit of one father on 5th of Sept., the Teacher's Day. I was in a lab. taking viva. HoD called me on phone. Father of one student wants to meet me! Enters the father, one of the simplest person I have ever seen, with only a polythene carry bag in hand which shows the sign of being used many times before. Beard in his face. And none can miss that smile. He is the father of President Gold Medal (PGM) winner of the institute this year, the topper among dual degree students. The son is the only one to get selected in prestigious MIT (Link) for higher studies in the Electronics discipline. The child who intentionally performed poorly to avoid going to a reputed hostel leaving the loving parents, is now at the other side of the globe. Twice a day video talk closes the distance a lot. We wish like his father that the son comes back to serve the country. Then I introduced the father to all lab. students, about eighty of them and they were in awe to meet the father of PGM holder and gave him a huge ovation. [Photo added on 16.9.2012 where proud father receives award from President of India during convocation on behalf of his son.]Teacher's DayThe Teacher's Day was a rainy day. The soccer match between the students and the teachers were postponed. However, the inauguration of the \"Electronics Hobby Hub\" went well. The senior most but evergreen Prof. N. B. Chakraborti, with his insatiable quest for knowledge, not only inaugurated the hub but also made the staff explain different experiments, student project materials. The lab. students beautifully decorated the lab. and organized a beautiful function. I had NSS faculty meeting in the evening. Had a call where after a discussion, I was asked to give consent to a nation wide technology development initiative with deep social implication. The answer was obvious and I hope and pray that I can make those proud who placed / place a lot of faith in me.A conversationStudent: Respected Sir, First of all wish you a very very Happy Teachers day on this auspicious day. Sir, as I am in teaching profession I always see you as my  ideal teacher. The way you speak to us, the way you behave, everything I like very much and try to reflect these things in my life. I specially enjoy the discussion in the lab. Specially your suggestion in handling a big problem by spliting it into smaller ones, I mean how it behave in smaller data helps me a lot in my research and also in real life. In short you are my true ideal teacher and the year I spent with you will be a memorable year in my life. Sir, I always need your blessing through out my life.  Teacher: Thanks student. I don't know if I deserve these kind words. We see in others what we have in ourselves. It was all within you. My best wishes.More Pics"},
{"title": "Counselling", "date": "Sunday, September 2, 2012", "text": "\"I have never in my life learned anything from any man who agreed with me.\" - D. F. MaloneI borrow this quote from the website of Student Welfare Group, IIT Kharagpur (Link). It is another matter to consider if agreement reinforces learning and clears self-doubt, if any. The message conveyed by the quote cannot be lost in a campus which houses thousands of stimulated-intellect, immensely potent individuals, the would be leaders. Ability to accept opinion of others, feedback obtained from various interactions in a healthy manner and working on them is more than a virtue, a recipe for success.We can and we do live with some amount of inability in almost every parameter that defines us as human. Imperfections are not uncommon. Some of us work on these deficiencies. Some do not. We are not that sensitive till it crosses the threshold. When it crosses, there can be two extreme scenarios. In one, the person tries to harm himself. In the other, the person tries to harm others. The little I wanted to share on the first count appears in this post (Link). The current post is to share few of my thoughts on the other extreme which starts with building up of anger within, one of the six ripus, the seers say, one must not allow to dominate. My mother often recites a Bengali poem which she studied in her school and remembers even now - \"Krodh samo pap ar nahi e bhubane\" (Anger is the worst malaise on the earth) and then the poem lists the ill-effects of Krodh, the anger.XLRI experienceThe one month training I had at XLRI, Jamshedpur about twenty years back makes me miss the faculty, the ambiance of that place even today. I remember that there was a photo frame on a wall there on which most important one word sentence, most important two word sentence, .... most important six word sentence were written. What I can gather from memory and search is the following.Most important one word sentence: Sorry!Most important two word sentence: Thank you!Most important three word sentence: May I help?Most important four word sentence: What is your opinion?Most important five word sentence: You did a good job.Most important six word sentence: I admit I made a mistake.All of us may appreciate the above. But if we try to adopt it in our life the \"I\" factor comes in between. This in some places has been termed as 'rascal ego' (Link), which is an impediment in our effort to reach our higher self.A friend indeedThe company we choose has a lot to do in how we grow up, how we respond to situation. The 'ego' may tell that 'I am in control of myself' and thus make me feel secured, insulated. This underestimates the effect of the company I keep. It is true that one has immense power within oneself to overcome whatever be the influence of that company. More often than not, we are not aware of that power and do not exercise that power. We should strive to increase our strength and at the same time be responsible for our act. Till we reach even a moderate level of self-confidence, we should exercise our option and caution to select our friends. We may ask ourselves - Does the company I keep gives me strength and happiness, makes me feel positive and good about life?We look for a company who is in agreement with my view of life. The more is our association with certain assertion, the more we feel attached to it. A rejection of that assertion or a counter view appears to counter me or reject me. I feel repulsive about the proposer of the counter view. I get angry. I cannot treat him as friend. I forget that I miss an opportunity to learn. I forget that only a friend can take the pain of a potential rejection but can show the courage and strength required to present a counter view. The people who agree to whatever I say, may be my ego booster but not necessarily my friend.Sympathy vs. EmpathyEven the best of the buddies may feel jealous at times. The '3 Idiots' movie has message for teachers as well as student communities. May be the message for the teaching community was more loud to make it a film for the youth. However one cannot miss quotes like, \"Jab dost fail karta hai to dukh hota hai. Jab o top karta hai to bahut dukh hota hai.\" A weak translation would be, \"It hurts if a friend fails. It hurts more if he tops.\" In a competitive environment, professional jealousy, envy cannot be ruled out. Sportsman spirit, like other character qualities, need cultivation. It is easy to sympathize - treat pain of others as my own. It is not so easy to empathize - treat both pain and joy of others as my own pain and joy.Facebook anecdote : \"Why do we shout in anger?\" I often am in two minds to accept facebook friend requests. For students sending friend request, the policy I followed is to wait till I am done with my role to apprise them. The small facebook friend circle I have, comprises of my batch mates, relatives, ex-students and people befriended through professional acquaintance. And I must say that this is another very important source for me to get educated and updated. The following anecdote was shared by one friend in facebook with whom I studied together during my BTech days at IIT Kharagpur.  A saint who was visiting river Ganges to take bath found a group of family members on the banks, shouting in anger at each other. He turned to his disciples smiled 'n asked.'Why do people shout in anger shout at each other?'Disciples thought for a while, one of them said, 'Because we lose our calm, we shout.''But, why should you shout when the other person is just next to you? You can as well tell him what you have to say in a soft manner.' asked the saintDisciples gave some other answers but none satisfied the other disciples.Finally the saint explained, .'When two people are angry at each other, their hearts distance a lot. To cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other. The angrier they are, the stronger they will have to shout to hear each other to cover that great distance.What happens when two people fall in love? They don't shout at each other but talk softly, Because their hearts are very close. The distance between them is either nonexistent or very small...'The saint continued, 'When they love each other even more, what happens? They do not speak, only whisper 'n they get even closer to each other in their love. Finally they even need not whisper, they only look at each other 'n that's all. That is how close two people are when they love each other.'He looked at his disciples and said. 'So when you argue do not let your hearts get distant, Do not say words that distance each other more, Or else there will come a day when the distance is so great that you will not find the path to return.'The story of three samuraiOne of my senior student heard it from his friend of Vivekananda Study Circle (Link). The story is simple but profound.It is said that Japan prospered under first samurai who believed in, \"If a cuckoo does not sing, remove it.\" It prospered even more under second samurai who believed in, \"If a cuckoo does not sing, force it.\" It prospered the most under third samurai who believed in, \"If a cuckoo does not sing, wait. If it is a cuckoo and if there is spring, it will sing\".In my theory class of 120+ students I found that a large no. of students were having 100 percent attendance. There are always some such students. But this semester the proportion was much higher. In IIT, there are so many different societies and activities and there are medical and family issues - it is not easy to find full attendance for a large population. On a lighter thread, I asked this community to start a facebook page and let me be the first to 'like' it. However, there were few who had poor attendance. The threat of 'deregistration' brought them back in the class. Given the time is short, and we ourselves need to work more to motivate students to attend class, and hold them there with inspiring lectures, a combination of three samurai approach may help the student community as a whole. Also we don't know what would have happened if the sequence was different for three Samurais. The first two may have prepared the ground for the third. Also, the tutorial, class test, mid-sem. exam., end-sem exam.  - we just cannot wait for spring to come and cuckoo to sing, more so if it is autumn semester :-)All the students will perform well if they are serious about themselves; little bit of disciplined life and there is no reason why they cannot reach milestones as per the timelines with ease. There will be no frustration, no jealousy. The problem comes when one tends to relax, feels complacent. My little experience is that this is where IIT system leaves no room, so packed is the program. Two-three fun-filled weeks during the semester, one keeps searching for clues what is happening in the class. There are no holidays before class test, lab-test, mid-sem, end-sem exam.s. Therefore, we try to make students aware all the time through interactions in the class, through emails, thorough posts such as these (Link). The students / parents can say if these are of any help or not.No injury to othersA question may come in the mind, \"Shall I remain quiet if somebody tries to harm me?\" It is true that we come across both good and wicked people in our life. Wherever possible we avoid the company of the wicked but there may be situations where we need to confront them. Sri Ramakrishna gives a nice solution of this through one of his parable (Translated in original, suggested  Link1 : abridged :  Link2, All tales and parables : Link3)There lived a poisonous snake in a thinly populated jungle region.  It was so poisonous and it would attack people at the least provocation resulting in the death of victims.  One day a Brahmachari happened to pass that way and the snake was about to attack the holy man.  He uttered a mantra and immediately the snake was subdued.  Then the Brahmachari told the snake that it should give up its harmful nature.  He initiated the snake with a mantra and asked it to repeat that mantra regularly.  After the initiation, the snake completely changed its way of life and started living only on grass and fruits.  It would not harm anybody.  Once the boys of that area went near the snake and were surprised to find that the snake was not reacting angrily.  They lifted it by the tail, thrashed it on the ground and left it there thinking that it was dead.  The snake was hurt seriously but not dead.  Slowly it went into its hole and would come out only during the night.  After some months, the Brahmachari again came to that area and enquired about that snake.  He started calling aloud for the snake which came out after great difficulty.  Seeing its condition, the Brahmachari asked as to what had really happened.  The snake had become so Sattwik that it was not even able to recollect that the boys had thrashed him.  But, after several promptings by the Brahmachari it was able to recollect and narrated its tale of woe.  Then the Brahmachari admonished the snake saying that, “I told you not to harm people, which means that you should not bite anybody, but I didn’t prevent you from hissing so as to protect yourself.” One can protect oneself like this without injuring others. A soldier in army injures enemy as a part of his duty*. The civil society need not consider a fellow being as an enemy. Neither it can be called a duty to harm another person. Any attempt to do that will bring agitation within which will harm me more than anybody else in the long run. Avoiding such a company / situation, hissing as told in the parable (pretending to harm to scare away - since it is pretension and not actual, no harm to others or self) are useful. Also, the power of organization, as told by Vivekananda is helpful. He observed that the secret to have a great future of India lies in organization, accumulation of power, co-ordination of wills. He talked about all the powers of good against all the power of evil. However, we must not forget \"Hate the sin, not the sinners.\" Wicked self of one is an aberration. If one is capable and confident, one can try to make such a person familiar with his nobler self.[*Told by a research student of another Dept. during recess of an interview. We had some time before the start of the interview and started chit-chatting. The student told that he attended one study circle previous Saturday in his native place called Narayangarh (about 30 KM from campus). The topic of their discussion was : What is duty and how to perform it.][Update on 05.9.2012 : Today's Times of India, Kolkata edition reports famous Kolkata premier league footballer Tolgay saying \"Everything is forgiven but nothing is forgotten,” on his spat with former club East Bengal as he switches over to their arch rival Mohanbagan this season. Without going into the merit of this particular case, we can ask ourselves in the context of this post, when we say the same - what is not forgotten when we forgive someone. Is it the lesson learnt or something else? The first sentence in wiki (Link) says, \"Forgiveness is the renunciation or cessation of resentment, indignation or anger as a result of a perceived offense, disagreement, or mistake, or ceasing to demand punishment or restitution.\"]Anger and family lifeLast THU evening got a call from a place about 10 KM from a campus where I stayed during student days. My father was in railway service (Link) there. An appointment was requested from me. The nature of my responsibility here needs interaction of many, many people which are not always predictable. The WED evening went in an impromptu meeting with two students of Robotix society. They were looking for a solution to a drift problem where an accelerometer and a gyro are put together. Also there were visits of NSS program officers. There is a meeting with Technology Transfer Group students on FRI evening for 100 days, 100 patents campaign. The SAT is dedicated to NSS activity (Link). And there are few thesis to complete before convocation. Therefore, decided to set off then and there.Reached the origin of call at about 6:30 PM. Here is a mother who cannot sleep anytime during day and night, keeps standing at the 1st floor balcony holding iron grills at hand, looking at the entrance of the house, waiting for son to come. She visited CMC hospital, Vellore five times and has many different diseases. Her entire thought process revolves around the only son. The son, highly educated and in a high paying job, has distanced himself since marriage and abuses if any effort is made to contact. Even a phone call at home is not made which is the only thing the mother asks for. However, money is sent regularly. I was not in a position to get into compulsion, if any, the son faces, what enrages him so much and the family issues, what happened in the past etc. The little I could do is to counsel the mother with what people taught me, not sure how well I understood them. The essence had been to draw attention to things that she has with her as support system (and not the ones she is not having), the reality of life as prevalent in modern society on service rendered to ageing parents (more among the educated and elite) and lessons conveyed in parables of various holy books. Spent about 2 hours. The lady who cocooned herself in a room upstairs for long, came downstairs to say bye. Assured to visit again. The other day I was wondering if NSS volunteers (Link) can reach out to this section of the community who served the society when they were able and are now abandoned in some sense (social, emotional need).[The attached pic is shared by a friend in facebook. The narration says : I clicked this picture at Chennai interstate bus terminal. The weight of this boy is around 90 KG,he is mentally and physically ill. He even can’t walk. You can see how his mother is carrying him…???? Can you believe this!!! ……we salutes all mothers in this world!!!! Mom you are great!!!!!I remember a play that I witnessed in the stage of Durga Mandir, Golebazar, Kharagpur during my student days, most probably enacted by Shaonli Mitra group. A son, who had lost his good sense, decided to oblige a demand that asks him to give his mother's heart as present to someone. He tip-toes to find mother sleeping, with no fear in her face, lest from her son. The son flashes his knife, takes out the heart, stained in blood. As he hurries to offer his present, different kind of feelings descending on him, he takes a miss-step and falls on the ground. The mother's heart in his hand gets an anxious voice, \"My child, hope you are not hurt!\" It was in Bengali, \"Bachha, la ge ni to!\"There are stories of other extreme where possessiveness manifests in another manner. I shall be exceeding the brief of this post to dwell on this complex issue - how much space an individual requires for oneself. May take up in future. ]Relocation of friendReceived an SMS two days back. Somebody from Civil Service background, who I came to know in course of my professional responsibility and was delighted to receive a 'friend' request in facebook, is leaving Kharagpur and is relocated in Chief Miniser's Office at Kolkata with a higher responsibility. Shall miss him here very much. Our best wishes for the new assignment.EndnoteDistance does not matter. Let our friend circle continue to grow. Let us always find a friend when we need  - true friend, not necessarily someone who agrees with me whatever I say and dumps on me negative thoughts and ideas. Let us never think of extremes of any kind, that can harm me or harm others. Let us help each other and together the society that we all serve.For professional counselling service which assures confidentiality, one is suggested to take help of institute counselling centre, the details of which can be found here (Link)."},
{"title": "In retrospect", "date": "Sunday, August 26, 2012", "text": "Prof. M. N. Faruqui (1952 -56 IIT Kharagpur student; 1958 – 1990 Faculty at IIT Kharagpur) left his mortal frame yesterday (24.8.2012) at about 11:40 AM. SMS, Email, Telephone, Meeting at the corridor - the message got spread. The Dept. gathered in the afternoon to pay homage. Senior faculty members remembered him as one of the second generation leaders who led the Dept., specially in the field of communication engineering. His students, drawn from teachers and visitors to the institute, remembered the teaching style he introduced for new PG programs. He used to give currently published good journal papers as text material, asked students to study that for few days and then involved them into discussion on that topic. Prof. S. L. Maskara, a close associate of Prof, Faruqui wrote in his message, \"All those who ever came in contact with himimmediately bonded with him. He had a towering and charming personality with agenerous heart and ever smiling face. He embodied Wisdom, Vision, Compassion,Courage, Patience and Confidence. His breadth of knowledge in various subjectsand analytical skills to go in depth with strong reasoning power displayed onall occasions of crisis. People rushed to him for solutions to their problems.He could easily win over even his opponents.\"During my B.Tech. days, I found him as Deputy Director here. I studied the book, 'Basic Electronics' authored by him but did not have any opportunity for class room interaction. The Prof. Faruqui I know is a thinker, a person candid with his expression, with immense love and zeal for education sector in India and he is an IITian by core. A prolific writer that he was, we can find his wisdom, his IIT experience in various articles he left behind. Excerpts from some of his write-ups are presented below. Section heading added by me to improve readability. The mortal frame is no longer there but he continues to live through what he left behind in our mind space.The following is from 'Down Memory Lane' published by  Nehru Museum of Science and Technology, IIT Kharagpur in 2001.Arrival at IIT Kharagpur as student (Year 1952)It can easily be said that if the Indian society was undeveloped, the opportunities open to a young man in a small mofussil town like Ballia of UP in the l950 were also extremely limited. Obtaining a First Class with distinctions in two subjects and 75% marks in science subjects in the Intermediate Science examination of the UP Board that year did not open any doors. Engineering degree options available were at BHU, AMU and the College at Roorkee. BHU won't have me and my father was against AMU for reasons I will not go in here. Roorkee was beyond his means -- the monthly charges alone being Rs 260 per month. B.Sc at Allahabad was very attractive and there I spent two years of my life. Here it was that we heard of a new engineering college being opened by the central government at some place called Kharagpur in West Bengal. I applied for admissions here, was interviewed in the office of the Vice-Chancellor of Allahabad University and was selected.I joined the Higher Institute of Technology, Hijli, Kharagpur in August 1952 The authorities wanted that we must have six half-sleeve shirts and six pair of khaki trousers and one mosquito net when we arrive here.IIT Kharagpur, The melting pot : Another First (very important but not much talked about)I believe that Kharagpur was the first educational Institution in India where 300 boys stayed together and ate in a common mess -- disregarding the caste considerations, vegetarian and non-vegetarian issues, religious issues and finally distinctive tastes and eating habits of people coming from all corners of the country and assembled in one place and under one roof. It was remarkable to say the least. I had some experience of other cosmopolitan universities like the Benaras Hindu University and Allahabad where number of messes were established and one could join any one of those. Brahmins, Chhatriyas, Vaishyas and others had naturally segregated into homogenous groups of their own. For example Brahmins and Chhatriyas from Ballia had separate messes. The students would hire a cook who would prepare the food of their liking and taste.The Building of IIT Culture:The independence, the camaraderie, the mixing of people from all over the country, the responsive and supportive Faculty and Staff and the opportunity of developing an individual's talent and character was unique at Kharagpur. The other IlTs copied it and the products coming out of these portals have made India proud. The shaping of the destiny of this IIT owes much to Sir J.C. Ghosh the founding Director and Dr S.R. Sengupta who followed in his footsteps.Examination (Open Book, Closed Book):The number of experiments in the academic and administrative processes that Sir JC tried is amazing in retrospect. We had then a yearly system with two terminal examinations in between and a final examination that theoretically covered the whole year's teaching. In the second year we had 23 examination papers in the terminal examination. In 11 subjects we had a 2-hour closed book examination [7 to 9 AM] followed immediately by a 2-hour [10 AM to 12 noon] open book examination. Only the English language paper had no open book component. In another terminal examination no dates for the examinations were given and the teacher could, after entering the class, declare that that day he was going to have a 1-hour examination instead of the lecture. These unannounced 1-hour examinations were the toughest since we all were totally unprepared, so much so that a student could be casually absent and miss that examination altogether. I suppose the scheme finally did not work and was abandoned. Short tests of 15 to 20 minutes were a different kind of thing. I suppose we lost the fear of examinations altogether. In my first year the Tutorials in Physics and Mathematics were held in the Hall after 7 PM and each tutorial class consisted of 8 students only.Was it mandatory to pass all subjects?To be promoted from one year to the next and to get a degree from this Institute one did not have to pass in all subjects. There was a Results Review Committee that decided the maximum number of subjects that a student could fail and the aggregate marks that he must have to be promoted to the next higher class. Naturally in such a system no grade cards were issued and one would only obtain a certificate indicating that such and such had passed with Honours in First or Second division. The trouble started when the American universities insisted on getting a grade card with letter grades. Of course students who were promoted despite failure in subjects were not the ones applying for studies abroad. I feel that the system was quite okay since the opinions have now changed and even Secondary schools are not insisting that a student must pass in all subjects in order to pass out of the school system.The following is from the article \"Failure in in Engineering : Remarkable Success Elsewhere\" (Link) where we see the teacher-administrator in him in his dealing with a student of special kind. Also, this shows how one can never be a loser if he / she is sincere in his / her pursuit of dream and does not give up. Finally, how compassion and soft core of a teacher leave behind apparently harsh and duty-bound self of an administrator - with no love lost between him and the student. A lesson for all!Not his cup of tea!Tejinder Singh got into Engineering at IIT Kharagpur through the toughest Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and showed that he was, that year, amongst top 2000 students in India. His career started well and was noticed in Hall activities like Dramatics, Music and other activities. But by the time he came to second year he was in the wrong company. I was Dean of Students and his problems landed on my table. His father was employed in Railways and posted at Kharagpur. By and by his plus points were getting lost into failure in examinations and numerous ‘reported’ troubles. He had to repeat the year. Naturally his parents were very upset and his mother met my wife and me repeatedly. I tried my level best to get him to perform but it did not help him much. He could not go beyond the third year and had to leave the IIT as a failure. I used to tell him that unless he studied and got out of the company of his ‘friends’ he would be good for nothing. He would be found selling peanuts at the Kharagpur railway station.In front of me he was always very polite and submissive, though he admitted once that he was not finding interest in Engineering. He always promised dutifully that he would make all efforts and would do well next time. That next time never came and he had to say goodbye to Kharagpur.Journalism, Not EngineeringA few years later I came across him at Howrah station concourse at 12.30 in the night. People who have been to Howrah station beyond midnight may be knowing that once the local trains have left the station concourse is taken over by thousands of large size rats. It is quite a sight. They even jump over people sleeping on the floor. I was waiting for my wife whose train from Lucknow was 2 hours late. I was surprised to see him and asked him about what were his current activities and what was he doing at this time of the night at Howrah station. He said he was working in the well known Telegraph newspaper in Calcutta in the editorial department. I asked him whether he liked what he was doing and he said that he has now found out that journalism was his actual interest. We sat down on a bench amongst the rats all around and chit chatted about his job and about IIT.The tea available at the station is undrinkable because it is prepared from the Hooghly water that is salty. I said as much but he said that he knows a tea stall outside the station that serves tea made from good well water. Despite my protests he went out and brought two cups of good quality tea. I felt happy that he was enjoying his work at last. It was really a chance meeting and completely out of the way.Getting Settled!Last year,  I was at Lucknow when I got a call from a student at IIT Kanpur that a gentleman named Tejinder wants to meet me and wants to know whether he can come and meet me at Lucknow. I was overjoyed to hear him and he did drive down from Kanpur to Lucknow – a drive of two hours. He is a Sikh but now he had lost all his hairs and is bald. He was now in Brussels and Chief Editor of an International magazine. He could hardly stay for an hour because he had to drive back.He was still the same Tejinder but now was a European boss of an organisation.Failure vs. SuccessBoys at IIT Kanpur had compiled a list of IIT students who could not complete their studies at their Institution but had done well in later life. These boys had hit on his name and had invited him to Kanpur. He jokingly said that my prophecy about selling peanuts was wrong. He always felt obligated to me though I really could not do anything for him finally. I remarked as such but then he said that out of the whole lot of people at Kharagpur I was the only person who listened and even sympathised with him though I fired him many times. From another angle through his struggles and hard work he succeeded in a career of his choice. I will call him a ‘Success’ story though he gave lot of worries and heart burn to his parents and well wishers in the beginning. Finally he made us proud of his exploits.I shall conclude this post with excerpts from his article titled \"Lament for IITs\" (Link) published on June 06, 2011 where we see an educationist, an analytic IITian and a visionary who projects past to future. Also, we find here one whose heart bleeds for his beloved institute.IIT and World ClassThe lament that the IITs, IIMs and the Universities are not world class is not justified when one measures the low output, of at least the five original IITs, in terms of Research and Development over the past six decades or so. I joined IIT Kharagpur in 1952 as a student when that first IIT was only one year old and was functioning from an abandoned jail building. The WWII had ended a few years back and even the mighty American Universities and Colleges did not have much of engineering research. Around the same time India became independent and looking around our political leadership found that the country needs ‘world class’ engineering colleges to produce Engineers that would drive the country forward.  .. There was no emphasis on research and all the effort was to teach things that would be useful to the industries. In the initial stages teachers were recruited from the industries and there were practically no Doctorates in engineering departments at Kharagpur. We had Professors from UK, Germany, Russia, France and USA in engineering departments but all the research was confined to the Science Departments. Things started changing from 1964 onwards when the first Indian PhD in Civil Engineering was awarded by IIT Kharagpur.Benchmark was acceptance by “our industries” and not researchIt is possibly forgotten that in the decades of 1960-80 there was no Internet, no Xeroxing facility and only a very cumbersome cyclostyling facility was available in offices. Very few journals existed and even in IITs there was no funding for research by the Government till 1970-1 when the first good research grant was given by the Ministry of Defense to all the five IITs . The IITs and the government expected that the IITs would produce B Tech graduates comparable to the best in the world and everybody was proud of our product all around. From personal experience I can say that whenever we reviewed our performance the benchmark was acceptance by “our industries” – a fiction no doubt. Our students were highly successful in research and development orqanisations world over, something that made all of us Indians happy. We were blamed off and on for “brain drain” and that we were producing graduates that did extremely well in the USA and UK. Teaching and curricula had to suit the requirements of the Indian industries there. Despite all of this the faculty at the IITs did commendable research and we did exceedingly well there. In certain areas the publications in esteemed foreign journals from the IITs was higher than those produced by MIT, UCLA and Stanford. The Indian industry by and large was NOT interested in these research outcomes.The blunder it was and the lack of  industry support If the requirement was research then we did a colossal blunder in concentrating on Under Graduate education  and that is persisting even today. The industry said we are good and the measure used for judging was “placement”.  Do we serve the industry or do some “not wanted” research. Our industry-controlled and run for the profit motif is full of “so called” industrialists who buy CKD and SKD goods from abroad and sell it in India. Where were the famous “industrialists” who are interested in any technical development? Research had become purely abstract like in science research and no industry was wanting it or bothered about it and actually had any use for it. It is easier to import the product and sell it rather spend money on developing it where the success rate of 10 percent return on investment is extremely good. Even if we take mass produced and consumed items like cell phone, fridge, refrigerators television sets, computers, laptops etc. we find that they are all foreign make. It appears that we have taken a vow and resolved that we will never produce mass consumption items like the ones cited above in our country. Naturally there is no need to do any research in items where major profits are made by Europeans, Americans, Koreans, Japanese, and lately Chinese. Maybe the Swiss Bank odyssey of our people is kept alive by such policies.AND now suddenly we discover that we are nowhere in the Industrial development scene in the world and that IITs should have been doing industrial R &D but pray for whom.The Malaise withinI hope it is understood that large number of B Tech would never take us forward in R & D.  We were busy getting our children admissions in IIT failing that in other look- alike and sending them abroad later if possible.  More than one hundred thousand students go abroad for education and not brain drain. ‘Satyanas’ of education was written when “Coaching” stopped all creativity avenues for a 14 year old Indian. His Nose to the grind of 4 hours coaching over and above the school hours and learning by mugging has taken away fun from school. His total focus is in getting admission into IIT or a good Medical College – failing that in a good engineering college. Again despite this urge the ordinary Indian family dreams of Indian Administrative Service because of “power”, money and prestige it gives to a society accustomed to a “ruler”.Suggestion for futureAn out of the box suggestion for making major changes in the IIT system is as follows.We change our system and make IITs to offer a 5 year M Tech (no B Tech) and an option of 7 year PhD programme for students who qualify in JEE. It should be attractive enough to get the best into it by offering good scholarships and freeships. If a student chooses the 7 year programme his entire 7 years should be tuition free plus a good fellowship. The IITs do not offer a B Tech programme but other colleges are free to do so. They could offer a five year M Tech plus PhD programme after the B Tech with attractive fellowships and freeships.Good number students getting in this IIT system should be given free tuition for all the seven years. Scholarship / fellowships of say 25,000 rupees or better to start with. (Medical education in USA follows this pattern) .Teachers in the IITs should have no fixed pay scale. Salaries to depend on his total commitment to research, publications, teaching ability, projects handled and consultancy. Such a Professor is treated as an asset.All industries are forced by legislation to spend 2 percent of their profit on relevant R and D.  Tax relief be built in the legislation. They be asked to fund for research in R & D areas of their activities.Like most of the countries that have a ‘certification for engineers’ we should have a compulsory legislation for certification of our B Tech qualified engineers. M Tech may be exempt."},
{"title": "Fresh Blood", "date": "Tuesday, July 31, 2012", "text": "\"Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested, all your life.\" - Vivekananda\"I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think.\" - SocratesIf a faculty member like me lives longer than average, it might be due to the fact that we are injected with fresh blood every year :-) A new academic session begins. The campus welcomes new batch of students. All the undergrads are accompanied by their guardians. They too are moving around with their wards in market, in welcome session of the Dept.s, interacting with faculty members etc. The postgrads get settled easily as they already have hostel experience, an experience to stay away from home, taking care of themselves.A part of our exercise in the Dept. welcome function was to interact with guardians of unndergrads - to remind them and us that the job is not finished yet. Stepping into IIT is a big step but only a step. It is important how the facilities, infrastructure, opportunities provided are put to use. Student, faculty, guardian need to act together to get the best out of it. The students may have a reason why they tend to lose grip over the situation once they are here. In this interaction, guardians were telling their pre IIT-JEE routine which used to be study, study and study; from early morning to late night ... with only one goal - to clear IIT-JEE. It is so tough an exam., most of them are not sure to 'crack' it and plan anything beyond IIT-JEE or set a higher goal. Once they clear the examination which they saw as a hurdle, for which they were asked to sacrifice their interest in sports, music, novel, travel - all that make life so beautiful, they feel an urge to make the most out of life. The pre IIT JEE days made them live in a high pressure, tense environment. Clearing the exam.  makes them believe that 'the goal has been achieved'. It is time to enjoy life and cry full volume \"Jeene do, jeene do, bachpan to gaya \", to break the chain of bondage (not literally!) and breathe free, to go out and bathe in sunshine. The movie \"3 Idiots\" actually depicts the pressure situation to enter IIT and not what exists inside. Just regular attending of class and even fifty percent of the IIT-JEE preparation effort is more than enough to get a very, very good score here. This leaves another fifty percent or more for breathing purpose :-) but the students tend to overdo with their new found freedom and overplay the sense of security associated with being into IIT.The IIT-JEE success may have another effect on young minds. The society looks at them with reverence. The junior students in the school or locality treat them as hero, asks advice from them. The guardians find that they now have special place in the larger family and relation. The fame, the glory associated, may make one desire that the euphoria continues as long as possible. Why not given the sacrifice made? And then comes the harsh landing. In IIT, you are competing with the very best. Gone are those MCQ mode preparation where correct answer is before you as one of the choices ... which you have to circle ... certain amount of intelligent guess or back calculation could be used as a trick in some cases. Now all questions are subjective type. Having good teachers in class who do not struggle with subjects, make lot of material covered every week with comfortable ease. Students who are yet to get rid of the hang over of the IIT-JEE success, is deceived by high self-esteem. Before the feet are set on ground, exam.s start knocking at door. And, I repeat, these are no more MCQ exam.s.What next? It is but natural that someone who was worshiped few months before as hero, to find it difficult to accept poor performance, tell that to guardians. He starts disliking teachers and the subjects. And it starts its own vicious loop. Isn't IIT doing anything about it? Besides sensitizing students and guardians from the day they step into IIT system, there is Student Welfare Group volunteers (Link) who work under the guidance of professionals of Counselling Centre. Language could be an issue with many students. For them there is an initiative called Communique (Link) which provides a bouquet of soft skills. Gymkhana website advertizes various societies (Link) which helps a new comer to make friends and share both joys and sorrows. The other welcome function I attended for freshers, talked about this support system. The Vice President of Students Gymkhana, the highest position as student representative, started his speech giving emphasis on academics. He himself scored 9+ in many semesters and thus leads by example. The Prof.-in-Charge of sports profusely quoted Vivekananda and emphasized on all round development of character, that sports and games teach one team spirit, share and care, and most importantly how to accept defeat gracefully. Dean, SA talked about how to become responsible and asked students to make 'real' friends and not just 'virtual' friends on internet, hooked to computers. One point is to be noted here. In general, our students are cautious, careful and handle themselves very well. These words of advice are to those few who may get carried away by IIT-JEE success. We would like all students to reach their true potential and excel in life, make themselves and all of us proud.The third introduction I attended was attended by 500+ UG freshers who are joining NSS program. This mostly talked about NSS activties. In each of these introductions, I tried to say that IIT-JEE success is past and it is a new beginning - one has to take fresh guard and be focused from day one to play a useful innings (in cricketing language).[Added on July 30, 2012: It is worth noting what parents of an achiever say, for whom today's newspaper runs headlines like \"India goes gaga over Gagan\" (Times of India), the first medal winner for the country in London Olympics. The reporter asked the father Sri B. S. Narang what he would like to say his son at this moment. \"Now, I will tell him to prepare for the next event, 'aur jeetna hai abhi' (There is more to win.)\" Father was referring to upcoming events and advising son not to lose focus. Another news channel quotes him as \"If he calls me, I will congratulate him and tell him to do well in the next two events. He still has two more events left on August 3 and 6 (50m Rifle 3-Position & 50m Rifle prone). He should concentrate on those two events\". Earlier, the father told Gagan's teacher (shooting coach), \"In the range (shooting range), you are the dad (father)\". And this comes from the mother of our hero on pressure that comes from parents, \"When he left for London, we just wished him 'All the best' and told him to give his best shot.\" (Link  Link)]What went through my own mind when I cleared IIT-JEE? Suffice is to say that what I wrote above is not fiction. As soon as I heard that I cleared the exam. (I was never sure. Link ) from a friend, a sense of relief descended, that my father wouldn't be worried if I spent little more time on organization work (Link) with whom I was associated since Class III, and I was passionately attached to its activities. My father did enough to make me feel that there was still a long way to go. The hero-worship was curtailed. I understood that a good academic performance can give me more room and confidence to pursue extra-academic interest and live a fuller life. The lowest semester score I got was 9.28. The highest was what could be maximum i.e. 10. Every afternoon I played soccer and had more time for the organization activities. A balance can definitely be maintained. [Oh yes! I would like to say freshers that I was in N.C.C. and our camp was held in Chhatna, Bankura, and not in Campus. It was an abandoned army post of World War II, no doors or windows, no toillet. We had to face street dogs at night who used to look for the warmth of our blanket.]I would like to repeat here what I told to a small section of freshers and guardians at the end of Dept. welcome function. Please do not maintain distance with faculty members. This is one of the friendliest campus, may be 'far from metro' character has an ashram like effect, nothing else to do than live with, live within IIT. My request to freshers and guardians not to allow any problem to grow. Share it. Some of the students may feel homesick being out of family environment for the first time. They or any student are welcome to visit us any evening during 5:30-7:30 PM. It could be just plain adda, knowing each other. Or it could be helping to work out a plan for future, if non-existent. It could be a discussion on how to excel in IIT life. We owe our existence to you. You inject fresh bloods into us every year, keep us live and strong. The job we do to evaluate your performance in a subject is another and a specific role. Your assessment will be no different from us if you yourself objectively evaluate your own answer-script. Let that role not undermine a bigger role, part superceeding the whole.This post is not complete if I do not acknowledge the fact that we too learn a lot from our young students and it is not that we are here only to 'teach' them. In yesterday's NSS introduction, I gave the example of a fresher in last year's NSS camp. There was one student volunteer who was the best among the roti makers and served kitchen everyday. In NSS, IIT Kharagpur Camp, part of the kitchen responsibility is taken up by young students themselves. Even after three hours of laborious physical work of road laying, (Link) he used to join the kitchen team and start making roti for fellow NSS volunteers. During the final day feedback session, he talked about his motivation, \"I used think that I am serving those who are serving the nation.\" Let me, before calling myself a teacher, imbibe this spirit which my student has taught me. Let me feel in my thoughts and deeds, \"I am serving those who are to serve nation\"; As new academic session begins, let me remind myself that I belong to that institute which is \"dedicated to the service of the nation.\"Updated on Aug. 26, 2012The following excerpts from New Indian Express (Link1  Link2) are self-explanatory and shows where we fail to act. The student, parents, teachers, friend circle, relatives need to cooperate with each other as the student acclimatizes with new environment, new system. It is a sad story of a boy named Vadithya Nehru. His farm worker father, Vadithya Ramana was inspired by then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru who visited their village during inauguration of Nagarjunsagar dam and named him Nehru. Despite struggling to make ends meet as a farm labourer, Ramana somehow managed to save money for Nehru’s education.He wanted the boy to be an engineer. “I saved money for his studies and whenever he asked for more, I arranged it somehow,” says Ramana, sitting under the shade of a tree outside the Osmania General Hospital mortuary.The suicide of Vadithya Nehru (20), a student of Indian Institue of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, on Thursday is a reminder that the real test begins after the students enter the hallowed portals of premier institutions.Despite scoring an All- India rank of 6193 in the general category, Nehru found the course challenging and performed poorly in his first and second semester EE examinations, following which his admission was terminated.Educationists blame the objective-type pattern of questions for lowering the IIT-JEE threshold. “The trend of multiple choice questions has led to corporate colleges adapting a package form of education where students have to rote the answers. Even the standards of question papers have changed as now there are repetitions, a feature which was uncommon in the tests a few years ago. The IIT faculty I meet now say the quality of students from AP has gone down as students expect notes and ready-made answers rather than thinking creatively,” educationist Chukka Ramaiah said, who was credited with the earliest coaching institute in the city for IIT aspirants.The decision of letting a student go should be preceded by counselling and getting them prepared to explore available options. “Students have to realise that academics is not the be-all and end-all of their lives. In IITs, it is a crowd of toppers of respective schools but students have to realize that there can only be one topper in a given stream. As their sense of self-worth and selfesteem is linked to their academic performance, failing expectations often leads to social withdrawal and depression,” student advisor at the Counselling Cell of IIT-H Madhu Chadda said. She added that a majority of students from rural areas not having requisite language skills hinders their progress.IIT-K is a big thing anywhere, but in Narlaga tanda, it was huge. The boy was seen as something special even in childhood. Says his childhood friend Muni, “He always spoke of getting a big job and returning to Narlaga to do something. Maybe we expected too much from him.”IBNLive reports today (Link) how IIT Kanpur tried to help all such students. Except Nehru all twenty three availed the service.Fate being a cruel tease, it came to light Saturday that Vadithya Nehru, the IIT-Kanpur student who took his own life Thursday upon being rusticated by his institute, would have been reinstated if only he had asked to be. The dean of student affairs at IIT-Kanpur, A K Ghose, told Express on the telephone that Nehru had been one of 24 students who were struck from the rolls for failing to show a satisfactory performance in their first year.  All of them volunteered for counselling and sought readmission.  And they were readmitted with corrective recommendatons.  All except Nehru. Ghose said, “We give a chance to terminated students to apply again to resume their courses.  All the terminated students came back with their parents and applied for readmission.  We gave them counselling and recommended yoga classes to them.  They are all back in class, except Nehru.  I don’t know what happened to him. His brother came to campus and took him away."},
{"title": "When Dust Settles", "date": "Monday, July 2, 2012", "text": "The row related to IIT-JEE (Link) seem to be over. The debate unfolded many important points - the social imbalance, social inclusion, the state of education in rural India, the innate ability, the influence of money (coaching) making less affluent ineligible i.e. taking the eligibility criterion one more step closer to the fundamental - the coached student is no doubt more eligible for a competitive exam like IIT-JEE, but what about the eligibility (affordability) to get the coaching? The condition of cheap Govt. education is not uniform all across and appear to be many order below the standard asked for. Is it then money, affordability that make somebody more equal and eligible? Should it be so for public funded institutions which aims at the greatest good of its stakeholders i.e., benefit of masses and not classes? That is, should a public funded centre of excellence serve excellence spread out in the mass and not in the class? Why cannot IIT like institutions be made in private sector even after 65 years of independence? And everybody seems to know what IIT lacks and what is to be done. But they do not do that or there is something more fundamental that does not meet the eye. Though I find in talk-shows of television one such person, probably retired or made to retire, doling out prescription with a stamp of authority (academicians no match to them). This is not to ask people to stop debating, rather widening the discussion to include things beyond IIT and more fundamental to education and nation-building. We suddenly started talking about ills of rural education when IIT-JEE was linked to it. Why didn't we discuss it earlier? Shall we stop worrying about it if delinked from IIT JEE?Invitation to comment on draft National Youth Policy 2012 for next 10 years is available here (Link). The last page of this 30 page draft gives the mailing address. Why doesn't nation discuss this and debate; participate to make our youth of all section feel being cared? The draft nicely portrays plight and need of different sections of the youth. The recent India Today article (Link) on very high rate of suicide amongst Indian youth occurring in more 'developed' states, among high income group who belong to 'educated' class shows all is not well with education and development associated with it. What is missing in education? Let us try to be proactive and not reactive in our response. Let us try to create examples. Later in this post, I shall talk about one Central Government funded project running in 300 centres of Ramakrishna Mission across the country for taking education to the doorstep of the most marginalized. I don't find anything comparable and in public discussion. I wonder why. Hope, the discussion on social equality and inclusion will not die down and excellence available in villages / slums will be spotted, nurtured, recognized and given equal opportunity to avail the best facilities the nation can provide. I am not necessarily talking about reservation. I am talking about the attention, proactive steps the less privileged (not in terms of ability but opportunity made available) deserves. We NSS faculty of IIT Kharagpur visit nearby villages and slums weekly. If we compare the education and care of those kids and our kids in the campus, we cannot but say that the gap becomes wider in every class starting from Class I not because of the fault of those kids. By the time they reach Class XII, if they reach at all, most drop-out after primary school, next before Class X board exam or after that, the gap has widened to an extent that there is hardly any level playing field. Had they got equal opportunity, many of them could give the IIT-JEE eligible a fair amount of competition and could make themselves eligible.With speculations about top x percentile, Main, Advanced exam. put to rest, the nation should not lose focus on this primary issue or origin of the debate and take affirmative action. A group of 50-100 capable people can easily adopt one village and work together with Govt. and non-Govt. machinery there to make it a model one, at least make education provided to village children much better than what it is today. The corporate sector may take their CSR initiatives to the grass root and can do even more. The Govt. can aggressively adopt IT-enabled framework to initiate and monitor development activities. Talent spotting at an early age (in Primary School, Sarva Shiksha Kendra) and following them up through various enablers are going to make difference. A few success stories in a village, the whole environment will change, there will be no lack of motivation thereafter.IIT Kharagpur National Service Scheme (NSS) tries to make students (UG) go through an experience which brings them in direct contact with people in villages and slums and make them aware of the challenges faced by villagers and slum-dwellers. A beginning has been made but a long way to go. The making of a roof (Link) or celebrating Saraswati Puja (worship of goddess of learning) are not enough. The fund made available to the students from NSS is next to nothing. That too does not come in time. Our students forgo their tiffin allowance which they get for their weekly visit to village and use it for development work there which totals only Rs. ten thousand per village. We try to arrange more money if there is some special effort but that too is quite small. The language barrier is a big problem as there are very few students with us who can communicate in local language. Still, the students try their best and language of love is always the best (Link).I want to sound this post forward looking. Let us not get into endless loop of blaming one another and doing just back of the envelop calculation from XYZ theory to conclude, \"Nothing can be done\". One project that got my attention in recent times is called Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa (G.A.P.)  (Link) that started one and half year back. I got to know about how it works through regular email updates of Swami Nityasatyananda of Ramakrishna Mission Calcutta Students' Home. I met Swamiji for the first time in a seminar here few years back where he was describing his flood relief experience, the methodology adopted for relief work. He was just returning after a relief work in Midnapur villages. The attitude of service, meticulous planning, execution of plan reminded what Vivekananda told about balanced development of 3'H' as aim of education or measure of all round development - Heart to feel, Head to think, Hand to work. The further we are from this and embrace career-only education, the more we are inviting trouble for ourselves. Let us face the truth and do our bit before the dust settles.Swamiji's emails talked about the progress of the kids picked up from utterly marginal families living in slums, making life out of garbage dump or so. A glimpse of the background and picture of Swamiji can be found in following Bengali news channel report.The first three pictures of this post are of celebration of Saraswati Puja in a village where NSS IIT Khargpur works. The rest of the pictures are of G.A.P. shared by Swamiji. It shows living condition in their slum at Agarpara and progresses.On 30th December, 2011 Maharaj writes, \"It has been one year the Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa started andthe unconditional love of the holy trio changed our notorious/ hard-to-bearRohim Molla to a front-desk boy of the class, and it is reflected through theimprovement he himself made on his progress report of 2nd standard in his school,which follows as- (Full Marks/Previous Marks/Present Marks):- Bengali-(100/59/94); English-(50/26/47); Math- (100/57/100). Now he doesn’t goto pick garbage and resell them any more ... Rohim busy to complete the home tasks ofNetai sir. After all the tough discipline of Netai sir has shown its result. Wepray for the continuation of the success of both the teacher and the student.\" On January 04, 2012 Maharaj tells, \"Every day the littleGadadhars teach us new lessons in different ways. The following are two briefincidents by which we can enhance our own ethics-First, the story of Ankita, which is thecontinuation of an earlier mail depicting the success story of her. She is notonly a well-known performer in our so called education system but also she is aroll model of divinity. Few months back when she was awarded for her highestattendance,  she politely refused the prize as there was someone else withhigher attendance. Similarly after visiting her house repeated times, it wasdecided that she would be honored for her brilliant academic performance with asolar lantern to help her to study in the evening time. When she was offeredthe solar lantern, again she politely refused to accept it as the electricitywas given to their house 2-3 days back. In spite of her poverty andchildishness, she has shown her Excellency and finally boosted up with theaward to carry forward it in her forthcoming life also.Secondly, the story of Najma. The motion of herupliftment resembles that of some supersonic jets. In earlier days Najma usedto be quarrelsome, very often cheat but now she hates even to tell the word‘lie’ (\"Mitthya\"), rather she tells no more ‘wrong words’ (\"Bhul Kotha\"). Recently in their singing class,when one of the rids of the harmonium was somehow damaged, their teacher wantedto save them by hiding the original fact and instructed Najma to bring a gluestick by showing some different reason, Najma refused to tell the ‘wrong word’.The teacher became overwhelmed with the reaction of Najma and got the lesson ofmorality which engraved in her mind for the whole life. Afterwards when Najmawas asked the event, she tried to hide her Excellency but everyone was well awareof the real fact and it is decided that she would be awarded to keep herglowing image up. (The picture of Ankita and Najma now and before appear by the side)\"The April 18, 2012 mail says, \"In spite ofgiving anti-pox medicines, two days ago some of our gadadhars were found tohave some symptoms of pox. In the middle of the compact schedule of ongoingacademic internal assessment yesterday three pupils were surely diagnosed withpox, one of them in a worst condition. At first they were told not to come forfew days, but when they told that they have examination next day and moreover consideringtheir environment unprivileged situation we decided to let them come to theashrama along with others, so that they could have proper guardian, care andlove in this weak condition. Najma and Faruk still were in a better position,but Fatema was hard even to look at! She struggled tough only to swallow amixture of milk and biscuits. Yet when asked whether she wants to go for theexamination, the prompt reply was: ‘yes’. Later when maharaj told them to takea good proper bath, she dis agreed and reminded that she has an examination(\"Porikkha aache na?!!\")! And then the others also insisted to go for theexamination. During examination  aspecial room was arranged for them.However, when the examination ended they tookbath here, and a separate arrangement for diner was made  at vivekanana dham  for three of them. When Fatema was offered tostay at the ashrama at night, she refused because when tomorrow all of hisfamily members will go for work she will have to take the responsibility of hersister’s  child, an infant.\"The May 20, 2012 mail tells, \"Yes !! Still our little Gadadhars of Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa areregular in coming on the non-GAP days and Instead of coming at 4 pm now many days they are coming at morning to spend some extra hours from 8am to 4 pm.Some of their engagements are as follows :Ankita trained harmonium to her sisters of lower classesPlaying carom after finishing the home taskWashing their garments in a groupTelling stories by siting rounded on the green groundTalking making video chatting with some of their teachers who now staying abroadSome time visiting our Homoeopathic dispensary for their health checkupAn interesting matter : After seeing the film, \"I Am Kalam\", one of our student of class I, Abdul Kalam replying \" I am Kalam\" when some one asked - What is your name ? May be he can touch the sky, because not so studious Kalam is now very much particular not only about his studies but also his cleanliness.\" The June 11, 2012 mail talks about Puja. \"Puja Singh, one of our Student of Class I of Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa. You can see her photo (video appears below) nearly one and half years back, when the Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa Starts. Also can see her present photo in the attachment. At that time she is not going to School, now she is a Spirited student who scored 79/100 in Bengali, 40/50 in English and94/100 in Math in his last School Examination. She is also giving teaching to her mates.\"In another June 2012 mail, Maharaj describes the living of Saraswati, \"Three of them came today in the morning,Payel, Saraswati and Ankita. ...Saraswti, student of Class IV of Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa told she had some business at home. When inquired, we came to knowthat she would have to make gudder-packets: 10 rubber gudders in one pouch, 12such packets stapled, then 12 such stapled bundles in a bigger polythene pouchis to be sealed using wax-candle-flames. This whole job will give her OnlyRs.2/-, though the cost of stapler, pins, candles, matches is her own . She isin hurry not only to meet a monthly target of Rs.1000/- of their house rent ,but she has to make a bit bigger effort this month to contribute to theRs.15,000/- dowry demand made by the grooms family before the marriage of herelder sister. Their father left them few years ego and due to illness their mother is not able to do any work other then light household work.Knowing the hard reality none of us couldtell her to study, but she  was told tobring all her materials and her sister Laxmi (also a Class IV student of our Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa) here at the ashrama, so that theywould be helped to work in a cool, sound circumference, apart from other noisesof their locality.\"I shall end this post with June 24, 2012 mail of Maharaj, \"When we toldAnkita (Student of Class VII - in the picture to right) and Payel (Class VI - in the picture to left) of our Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa to write something which would be read-out at the time ofmaking video in English on Gadadhar Abhyudaya Prakalpa, they wrote it fromtheir own and read it in Bengali. Attaching the original writings in Bengaliand also the free translation from where we can feel their dream ...\"All of usexperience and feel many facts from our birth till we die. In my life I alsowant to feel pains, miseries, happiness of others. Of course I didn’t want thissince I came into so called worldly consciousness, neither did I thought ofthis. I used to think of myself only. Don’t know why , what happened but I wanted to feel those things. Stillnow I want that and try to do that way. I want to a Doctor. There are manyreasons behind it. I am trying to write some of those. Becoming a doctor I wantto do good treatment of poor people. I have seen such people that – son issuffering of fever and the mother sitting beside him has nothing to do except helplesslycrying as she has no money for the treatment. Not only other people, suchincident had occurred many times in my home too. Now such days don’t  come as I come here at the mission. I’ll be adoctor, help poor people in distress, and also help those who want to study butunable to afford it.-Ankita DeyI want to do alot of study. I know that misery and pain accompany our lives. We’ll clean allthem. But I want to be a teacher. But would my dream become true? Will we beable to feel the miseries of poor people? I have to go a long distance. Wedream of many things. When I’ll grow up, I will help to study those who can’tafford it, free of cost. But can these dreams be fulfilled? We’ll think of ourcountry. Who will believe our words? Don’t know.  When we see people insorrow I think one day we were one of them. But when we think of my thoughts Ifeel a deep pain in my heart: who will understand our  feelings.-Payel DasThe G.A.P. is targeted towards children between 5-12 years of age. The one and half year's care for children of one slum shows what is possible with love and care. Can a society which calls itself civilized remain aloof and think that Ankitas and Payels, Rohims and Kalams should not dream? I am not sure if Ankitas will be able qualify in medical entrance examination given the hardship they face and they will be pitted against highly coached students of affluent family, but I am sure that they will be better than many other doctors in serving the nation if given an opportunity and do more public good. Isn't that the aim of public funded institutions, the question I posed in the first paragraph? Let us try to give some of our time, may be as little as one hour per week, to reach out to them. Our smallest contributions too get counted. We have a responsibility. Let us believe in ourselves and work together towards an inclusive society."},
{"title": "The 26th June", "date": "Wednesday, June 27, 2012", "text": "The biggest surprise of the day came from the students in the lab. This was one such day when Her Highness makes sure that she stays ahead of others by wishing when clock strikes 00.00 hrs. Phone calls start coming early in the morning and continues throughout the day. And emails. Feel great to find a childhood pal remembering the day and making a phone call after long, long time. Apologetic call today for missing it yesterday. Assured that today is the day according to Bengali almanac and thus it was very much on time.This time 26th June coincided with Bipattarini (a form of goddess Kali or Chandi) Puja and Rathayatra  week. Ma (Mother) was ready by 8:30 AM. Together went to local Shiva-Kali temple (Prof. G. S. Sanyal was very much involved with this temple's development in his final years). I was happy to find Ma in smile, \"Khub bhalo pujo hoyechhe.(Puja was great.)\"  Often, due to rush or otherwise short-cuts are adopted which leaves old timers like Ma unhappy. The other reason perhaps was her contribution in making a lotus bloom. The same was placed on the sacred pitcher in front of the deity. Me, all the while, was busy in attending phone calls, talking to a colleague who was associated with NSS and of course offering silent prayer.An interview of me was scheduled at 11 AM in my office. Luckily it was not a test of my ability and pass a judgement on me (Hope so :-)). I saw my worth three days back sitting beside another IIT faculty at the other side of the table. I was astonished to experience breadth and depth of his knowledge. Long, long way to go to be considered remotely as wise. The correspondents wanted to feature few IIT faculty members in some article and I was picked up as one for being engaged in certain activities which touch common cord. Earlier I was interviewed by correspondents of national and international media but that used to be focused on certain specific research work. This one was more of 360 degree stuff and to be published in something which is very, very special and dear to all KGPians. Thus, I was little nervous to begin with. The correspondents were very professional to make me comfortable in no time. It was more of a friendly conversation where they were taking notes in between.The lab. students did not know about this scheduled interview. At 11:30 AM, one of them took the cordless phone from my office. That was not unusual as they often take that for testing our voice signature based applications. At 12 noon, he comes and requests me to go to the lab. for a demonstration. I requested him to go ahead with rest of the lab mates as I was not done with the interview. At 12:30 there was another lab student knocking at the door. He is instrumental behind our virtual lab. related developments. He requests me to visit the lab. and check a new DSP experiment he has just finished on virtual platform. I was naive not to suspect anything at this point too. Requested him to wait a while as I was almost done with the conversation with the correspondents.And then I entered the lab. Lo! what did the students do? I am no longer a child! But you do not actually complain to succumb to such wishes of students. There was nothing missed. Cake, candle, \"Happy birthday\" song and I was more overwhelmed than embarrassed. In my \"Thank You\" card I requested them to wish so that I become worthy of this love and respect. I narrated this to my 9 year old daughter while bringing her back from school. She was disappointed to miss the fun as she never saw his father doing some such thing like cutting a cake after blowing candles on birthday.Back home there were rituals like taking payasam and other socio-religious activities associated with such a day. Of course, the lunch was special. Spent last THU-SUN in Bhubaneshwas for some official work. Could not take family to Rathayatra fair in the weekend. At 6 PM, we set off for the fair ground near Jagannath temple at KGP town. Enjoyed the fair very much and was ready for dinner by 10 PM.Oh yes! Did not miss the work out for the day and am doing fine on that count. The other day one colleague wondered if I am visiting Gym. That I could shed 6.5 KG in 3 months just by free hand exercise broadened the grin! On another occasion I was walking along the corridor of a different Dept. when a senior faculty (who was our teacher too in a Basic Science subject) stopped me. Affectionately he took me to his room and showed one of my blog post on his computer screen. He appreciated the write-up and told that after retirement he would start writing his ideas. I thanked him and requested him to preserve the points in the form of bullets somewhere which can be expanded later. I heard that the author of 'Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna' (Link) used to keep notes in bullet form. Later he used to meditate on them to arrive at the full form. How much we are indebted to the author, Sri Mahendra Nath Gupta to bring Sri Ramakrishna live before us!The correspondent asked in the interview how I pursue many different interests. I unhesitatingly told them, whether it is research or NSS, it is the team who deserve the kudos. For research, full credit to research students. I just try to make them see the opportunities and ask simple, obvious questions on result and justification given. I am proud to say that each of our research students who complete tenure in our lab. can do research independently anywhere in the world. The same goes for NSS activities. The field work in a particular village is done by one faculty colleague and his student team. I just lend a support and discuss opportunities to serve, the big picture and how our smallest contributions too get counted. It is all their hard work and they are the ones.Let me end this post with some not-so-serious pictures of recent Bhubaneshwar visit. The work assigned in these 3 days stay was tedious, starting 9:30 AM every morning and there was no fixed time to end. One day we (myself and driver Tanmay) decided that 'enough is enough'. We started early in the morning and went around the city, visited famous Lingaraj Temple, Khandagiri caves. Few glimpses of this visit appear below. Camera was not allowed inside Lingaraj temple.Added on 28th June : This evening got a sweet message from a junior which in Bengali is \"bhawanipurer bari te j gaanta bijoydar sathe gaye tomar janmo din er subhechha janano hoy ni shei gaanta gaichhi..\"TUM BAY SAHARA HO TO KISI KA SAHARA BANO..\"  SUBHA JANMO DIN .\" He is in Railway service now posted at Southern India. He is remembering the function we used to have on this day at our Bhowanipur residence ... about 20 years back  and the song he wished to sing but could not ... today while wishing he remembers the same. Thanks Dipjyoti. Jaane kahan gaye woh din.... It used to be informal song, recitation, adda. At times, we used to have play. Just an opportunity to have a get together and lots of fun."},
{"title": "IIT JEE follow up", "date": "Monday, June 18, 2012", "text": "Since I posted 'Thoughts on IIT JEE' (Link) a lot of material has come into public domain. The opening statement of that post, \"The decision making process for new IIT JEE appears more interesting to me than the proposals themselves. \" appears more true today. There are quite a few articles in public space widening the discussion in which a lot of people - faculty members, students, alumni, educationist participated. To see PM lending ear and giving time to listen to points-counterpoints himself, shows the enormous value, respect IIT brand carries and also the importance given to it by Government of the country.While most of the points I raised in that post is articulated better by various columnists and I learnt a lot from their arguments, I am yet to see any article which dwells on the purpose of education and admission process. \"..it will do us a world of good to listen to him (Vivekananda) and direct policy implementation related to education on what he said as essence of education, \"We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.\" We need not interpret the last point of the sentence as making enough money.\"It is too early but it may not be just weak correlation to see what I anticipated as \"But the smarter among the population may try to migrate to certain boards which may appear to provide some extra edge.\" and what The Hindu finds here (Link).Also, I do not see any worthwhile discussion on what happens to the students once inside IIT, specially the importance of first year. The non-performance of a student in IIT is very much linked to admission process. Overlooking this, the number of failures and psychological cases will rise. Outlook India reports (Link), \"The statistics are shocking. In IIT Delhi, about 600 out of 853 students have gone through counselling because of excessive stress.\" The story is similar in other IITs. Coaching for objective type test, rather objective type test itself (students will be coached according to the exam.) is to be blamed when \"Says Arjun Malhotra, Chairman, Headstrong, and an IIT alumnus: “Today, kids have been trained only in the objective method of answering questions. Ask them to write an essay answer and most of them just do not know how to do that. Subjective skills are just not there.” And that puts pressure when they are swamped by the IIT curriculum.\" Society, specially the parents should note what Einstein said, before subjecting a youngster to unrealistic pressure, \"Everybody is a genius. But, if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it'll spend its whole life believing that it is stupid\". Now subjective type test for lakhs are not feasible in existing system. Objective type screening is to be followed by subjective type test. I suggested in my earlier post, an interview after that which may carry as little as 10 percent weight or so to have a test on attitude, extra-curricular etc. P. V. Indiresen in his article in Business Line (Link) says, \"If the IIMs can have an interview after the CAT examination, if people for the central services are selected after an examination and an interview, if even a peon is selected after an interview, why should not each IIT have the same, independent system?\" However, I have a different take on common understanding of autonomy. I am not worried much about who takes decision as long as the decision taken, takes us forward and does good to the people. Ultimately decision is taken by one set of people or the other. It all depends on their ability to read a problem, weighing various options through cost-benefit analysis and arriving at what is for the greatest good. Regarding constitutional right and its interpretation, the experts have already spoken in various forums and some of the links are shared in this post.I would like to place here few articles available in public domain that I found interesting on this discourse. One IIT Director is very active in cyber space addressing various queries, has given what necessitated the change and what it tries to achieve in his blog available here (Link). To my knowledge the most comprehensive discussion where a lot of academicians from various strata participated and that includes one IIT Director, is this post (Link) and various other posts by Dean, Academic Affairs of IIT Kanpur. Please go through the comments section. The article by an IIT Delhi faculty member that appears in a leading national daily can be found here (Link). Outlook tried to put all the views together here (Link). View of different faculty members of different IITs can be found here (Link).The blog (Link) by a UG student of IIT Kanpur is very, very well articulated. One may get perspective of an IIT-JEE cleared student there and also suggestions offered by him. There is an element of sarcasm in his writing but considering what he writes is valuable and his age, one may ignore that part and take the substance. The other student article I read and which is quite detailed is that of an IIT Kharagpur alumnus which can be found here (Link). This article is very inspiring which shows how a village boy scores only 39% in Class XII Board exam. but becomes a successful engineer from IIT to get as many as four scholarships from foreign universities for higher education. He can very well be a symbol of \"IIT Dream.\" If you have in it, you can get it! The third student article that got published in a prestigious newspaper like The Hindu is from IIT Roorkee (Link). One 16 year old IIT aspirant's article appears in NDTV's web edition (Link). I wish there was a more serious discussion on patriotism on the NDTV show 'We the people' on the topic 'Bonding doctors to duty' (Link). The national service was discussed from material plane and very casually. Even the anchor herself was skeptical if patriotism can be coded. A Delhi student talked about the pathological state of National Service Scheme (NSS) in the institute. The IIT JEE 2012 topper's brief presentation in the show spoke of himself. The fact is that love for country, love for humanity are already coded. The environment around tempts us to suppress it for short term gain. Money, comfort are more worshiped than character. Then why complain? Selfishness and unselfishness - both are there. We need that education, that mindset which nurtures and allows the noble qualities to flourish. We focus on falls. We do not see 'fall from what' and do not encourage people or create a condition which applauds a person if he / she tries to rise from a fall. \"When Adam fell, he fell from purity. Purity is our real nature, and to regain that is the object of all religion. All men are pure; all men are good. Some objections can be raised to them, and you ask why some men are brutes? That man you call a brute is like the diamond in the dirt and dust -- brush the dust off and it is a diamond, just as pure as if the dust had never been on it..\", says Vivekananda.We know, \"As you sow, so you reap.\"The policy makers need to decide whether investment in education means only preparing one for job market or it is something to do with total personality development. I have seen planning commission taking note of it in its Vision 2020 document prepared by Dr. S. P. Gupta (Link) which says, \"Wehave to locate the hidden potentials of the country, its strong points at thebase from which we have to build the foundation.  As has been quoted in the Report, it would bewrong to say that in 1947 India started to reconstruct a modern nation from thescratch.  Rather it began the process ofrediscovering its rich cultural heritage and spiritual values that had formedthe foundation of India in the past. It is on this foundation that we seek to formulate the vision for India2020.  To support this view, I quote LordMacaulay’s presentation to the British Parliament “I have travelled across thelength and breadth of India and I have not seen one person who is a beggar, whois a thief.  Such a wealth I have seen inthis country, such high moral values, people of such caliber, the very backboneof this nation, which is a spiritual and cultural heritage”.  Preparing a vision for 20 years ahead is verydifficult, especially if we look back at the fast changes that have taken placein India and abroad for the last 20 years, which are very fast and many of themcould not have been predicted.\" (The image on  Macaulay quote was shared by a Facebook friend. There is a debate whether the quotes are actual or this is an impression on his doing) Coming back to NDTV debate, I don't know if Ramakrishna Mission monks, many of them are from IITs and I know one of them as Bhatnagar awardee (Link , Link), participate in such panel discussions or not. Wish they are there to have a 360 degree view of the topic.   Referring to articles by others does not necessarily mean that I subscribe to their views. I find their takes on this issue interesting. I have shared my thoughts before (Link). Finally, this article (Link) titled \"How will you measure your life?\" was shared by one of my IIT Kharagpur batchmate commenting on demise of an American Dream (Link). One cannot ignore human values for long for arriving at real solutions to any problem."},
{"title": "Scaling Heights", "date": "Sunday, June 10, 2012", "text": "Came a request to attend a project monitoring meeting which we are mentoring for long. The project is executed in one of the farthest of the North Eastern states. This was my first such assignment, belonged to a region which is trying to catch-up with the rest of the country also in terms of scientific R & D, and the problem definition had hundred percent correlation with what we do at our own research lab. here. Therefore, even if the meeting was scheduled during very important 7-10 days period of checking end-sem. answer-scripts, I was not in a position to skip it. Got prepared for a KOL-GHY flight and then 6-7 hours of road journey. Had been there before and liked that place. Suddenly, I was told that the meeting would take place in GHY itself, the project execution team was coming down there.Had to prepare a contingency plan. This is the time where we need to make everyday, including weekends count. And I am awfully slow in checking scripts, average about fifteen per day. What to do?  Each answer-script is like a novel. Answers to questions are like chapters. Concepts are like characters. And there are so many shades of characters! In my mail to students when I asked them to come for checking their evaluation of end-sem. answer scripts I wrote, \"... an answer-script tells lots of things - the strength and weakness of a student as seen by a teacher. It won't be possible tomorrow to address each of you individually. If you are interested, you may visit day after tomorrow or later by taking an appointment (you may try without appointment too but I may be in some other meeting).\" Whether students like this or are more worried about grades .... whether they want to be treated as customers where we are service provides and the customer satisfaction is directly proportional to grades awarded, is a different issue which we can take up later. It is suffice to say that I am proud of our students. I understand their sentiments regarding inflationary tendencies seen at many a places and if 'no inflation' weakens their career prospect in anyway or if it is for greater good. At personal level, I find a lot to improve from the student feedback and each year is a different learning experience.Coming back to where I was, the contingency plan was to carry answer-scripts with me and utilize slack hours during the journey or stay, for evaluating them. I do not find difficulty with concentration level as I am practising similar things from childhood. I remember waiting in long queues (which extended to main road from the shop and often one had to wait for hours) for weekly quota of kerosene oil in 'Fair Price Shop' pouring over a study book in my hand. This of course was no 'child labour' but sharing a responsibility; my father (link) was doing more than what he could do. ToI reports felicitation function of toppers by the state Chief Minister, Smt. Mamata Banerjee (Link), \"She tried to inspire students by quoting Swami Vivekananda in relation to several spheres of life. \"If there is no problem in life, how can you solve them and move ahead?,\" she asked. Adding,\" never lose heart or be disappointed. Do not feel depressed amidst the challenges that life throws at you. But, work hard to overcome them. \" She further said that a needy student managing own study expense by offering tuition, was common place before. Now that very thought frustrates a young meritorious student. One should be always positive about life. I hope the student remembers what the state higher education minister said, \"Behind your success, there are contributions of many people in this society - from your parents, to the cobblers who mend your shoes to the tailor who has tailored your school uniform. When you grow up and establish yourself in this society, do not forget them.\" Incidentally, after my Higher Secondary examination result, the felicitation was done by then Chief Minister, Shri Jyoti Basu. Surely, it is a overwhelming experience and gives lots of confidence to a youngster. Compared to study in Kerosene Oil queue and standing, the study in crowded suburban train and sitting used to be a cake-walk. Thus, checking answer-scripts during the KOL-GHY flight was not at all a problem. And I was fully engrossed in it. Quickly finished snacks offered by flight personnel. And then was waiting for them to clear the space to restart. An elderly lady with N-E complexion was seated next to me. We had a language barrier. And I was sweetly surprised when she smiled at me and indicated to me to keep my food cutlery and  waste materials in her desk so that I can resume my work. Thanked God that I am in this noble profession and remembered the Chanakya Shloka studied in Class VII, \"Bidyatwancha, Nripatwancha, Naiba Tulyam Kadachana / Swadeshe Pujyate Raja, Bidyan Sarbartra Pujyate.\" (My weak translation : The King and the Learned can never be compared. The former is worshiped in his kingdom while the later is worshiped everywhere.) This is not to mean I am being worshiped or so. Rather I worship the virtue, the gesture I saw in that lady and feel grateful. This is to place before all the respect society showers on us due to our profession, the care we provide and the responsibility associated with it. Interacting youth in the age group 18-24 years, for months and years where we are seen as teachers is a big, big responsibility and is much beyond customer-service provider relationship. If it is so required I would say that the nation is the customer and the students are the products and it is our duty to get a well-rounded personality of them who are ready to take challenges of life, nation, the humanity as a whole. The age group we serve makes men out of boys when they face important transitions in life - hope and pray I have the capacity to contribute by which the nation gets its greatest gift, youth as characterized in our scripture - Ashistha, Drarishtha, Balishtha, Medhabi i.e. hopeful / of positive attitude, resolute / confident, strong (in body and mind), and meritorious / intelligent.Soon the seat belt sign was on. We started approaching GHY airport. I had an opportunity to look at the gentleman at the other side of my aisle seat, across the walking bay. He smiled very friendly. I also smiled. As we two stood up one after another to deplane, he started the conversation - where I am from, where I am going etc. He is returning from KOL after US visa interview and offered me to drop at my destination in his car (he has further 6-7 hours of road journey left). When I asked his profession, he said that he is in farming. What for US visa then? He said, \"I want to climb the highest peak in US. I have already done that for three continents - Asia, Africa, Australia. I would like to do that for the rest of the continents.\" \"OMG! Do you mean that you have climbed Mt. Everest?\", I asked. \"Yes\", came his boyish smile. He is Tapi Mra. And he was proud to show his certificates which he took to KOL for visa interview. I felt proud for him and for myself to be acquainted with him, such a simple, down-to-earth person. We exchanged contact numbers. I inquired about the funding constraints he faces and if mainstream media highlighted his achievements (which can fetch sponsorships). Told that I have very little experience of mountaineering. In fact, I was under awe to go through a twelve day long adventure course when I was half this age, under supervision of Ms. Bachendri Pal (the first Indian woman to scale Mt. Everest). It was tough - staying in tents and sleeping bag in freezing cold, preparing own lunch after trekking more than 20 KM in the morning, rafting in mountain river and bathing in freezing cold water, acclimatization at scaling of every 2000 ft. to get used to lower oxygen environment, facing hailstorm when evening descended and we were short by 2-3 KM while trekking in narrow mountain trek - what not but worth such an experience. There were five ten-member teams to go through this course and I feel proud to say that our team came first and we got certificate of recognition from Ms. Pal. I shall try to locate some of those rag and tag pictures of that time and put up here.Later I found several pages on him (Link1, Link2, Link3, Link4), none in national media though, one of which says, \"He had to struggle against poverty and lack of sponsorship to give shape to his dream of becoming a seasoned mountaineer. Those who think that climbing Mt. Everest is all about grit and stamina are mistaken. Scaling the world’s highest peak also involves a lot of money and to meet his expenses and gather funds for the expedition, Mra sold off his four mithuns (bos frontals), semi domesticated cow like animals flaunted by Arunachalees as a status symbol in the tribal society. The government of Arunachal Pradesh and some local clubs in Arunachal Pradesh also provided substantial financial assistance to Tapi Mra to meet his expenditure to scale the dizzying heights of Everest.\" And when the expedition was about to be abandoned due to bad weather, \"He felt like he had to abandon the expedition when an avalanche killed some members of the expedition. He was so terrified that he almost decided to return home. However, he thought of the faces of several persons whose help made the expedition possible and this spurred him on. Crawling over the bodies of members of earlier expeditions imprinted on ice and which still looked fresh, he remembered he went past somebody sitting in a meditative posture near the summit with a flag in hand only to discover later that it was a body lying there for several years. After his successful descent from the peak, when asked how it felt on the top of the world, he proudly said that it was a divine feeling and felt like standing on top of the world as for the final moment of the assault he felt that he had an out of body experience and he forgot everything. A grateful Mra on his return after conquering Everest presented the Governor and Chief Minister a piece of the rock that he collected from the top of the world and the photographs of himself with the tricolour atop Everest.\"The last pic is  recent photograph gifted to me by Headmaster of a local village high school when I attended a function there. The second last picture is from our recent Mirik-Darjeeling-Kurseong tour. I may describe these experiences in subsequent posts."},
{"title": "Cholesterol", "date": "Monday, May 21, 2012", "text": "- \"Did anything happen in the institute? Tell me the truth.\"- \"No. Nothing.\"- \"Why then these series of blood tests? Ultrasonography?\"- \"These are routine check-up. Closing on 44 years. Prevention is better than cure.\"- \"Since when did you start taking care of yourself? How come you became such a good boy! Tell us what are the discomforts.\"- \"Nothing. I assure you.\"- \"This evening while talking to your office colleague, what were you discussing in low voice? Did you faint in office? Today or tomorrow, I shall get to know. Why don't you tell now?\"- \"Please try. No such things.\"And then the news got spread through her highness. Sister, in-laws started inquiring. Also students on seeing the leucoplast on arm. Suddenly, I find that a lot of answering is to be done. An honest and innocuous attempt to live healthier is raising eyebrows! But getting attention even if for a 'healthy' reason like this :-) where concerns are showered on you, suddenly makes you feel that you are not just playing a character role in the drama of life! And my sister and brother-in-law were most severe on me, I suspect that prompted by her highness, criticizing and telling me what I should do and what I should not.Do I deserve this much of criticism, trial by family and well-wishers? Did I miss morning work out (morning walk plus free hand exercise) for a single day in last two months? One/two day(s) miss does not count. As is said, \"Bhawanako Samjho (Appreciate the spirit)\"! What can you do if you have an early morning flight to catch or have a 7:30 AM class? Shouldn't want notice the 3KG weight reduction in last 2-3 months and not the 100+ KG absolute weight, the sacrifice made (sweets and other delicacies - more so when you have arguably the best chef of the campus at home)?The same can be said about office work. Returning home at 10 PM from office should not be overshadowed by the more regular 8:00-8:30 PM schedule! As such being in Kharagpur, being at IIT Kharagpur is always being at home for one who spent his childhood, youth in the town or in the campus. And the reasons for which one has to stay till 10 PM needs greater attention than the 10 PM itself! Let us take yesterday evening as an example. One research student's rehearsal of synopsis seminar started at 6 PM and went up to 7:45 PM (discussion on various points raised by group members). Then had discussions with four young IITKGP students (just completed 2nd year) who were invited in the seminar. These young students are braving summer heat, staying away from home in vacation to work with us as intern and one cannot but be overwhelmed by their dedication and salute their spirit. Once I finished discussion with them at 8:30 PM, I decided to use the late evening serenity to my advantage to type down a detailed thesis examination report which was overdue. Then took its print on letter head, signed and scanned the same, finally mailed it to the registrar of the concerned university. I was supposed to send it last Friday and requested few extra days. Thereby, the guilt feeling of being late is gone and I had a good night sleep. Wasn't that a healthier proposition than sticking to a 8:30 PM deadline?Let me defend the other criticism faced. This is 'stress'. Here is somebody who worry about big big things where nobody takes him seriously; and he doesn't worry at all about things where he can be taken seriously (of course, at mercy of the greats :-)). Isn't it a perfect recipe for remaining stress-free? Also, it is said that the things one does out of love, passion do not stress. Who can say that I am not enjoying what I am doing? I have seen guidance which tells people to be able to say, \"No\" to remain stress-free. I think that the coordinator of one of the lead funding agency was in 'shock and awe' when I flatly said 'No' to review requests dumped on me (about 5-6 proposals) without my consent. He was asking why I am late for an assignment that I did not accept at all. I politely said that I had several pending thesis examination work which I accepted and they are of higher priority. Came the reply on expected line, \"What will happen to your proposal if the reviewer says 'No' or delays the review?\" I don't know if I got de-stressed to say that I wouldn't be applying to them for fund to increase their trouble. I don't know if I should have told them if the reviewer deserves to know what happens to the fate of projects reviewed by them, how much weight the review carries, or if it is the final seminar presentation or any other stuff that are the decider. Perhaps that would have increased the stress level somewhere. Didn't I do good to myself and the society to keep the cumulative stress down? Who will appreciate this?Whether you apply or not, your application is considered favourably or not, it feels good to be one of the two persons in \"To:\" list of a mail where application is requested for a faculty position in a lead European University. That somebody notices you at some other part of the world is itself a big 'feel-good' factor. However, aging mother (72+ years) who stays with us in campus quarter and other factor do not allow me to go out even for a semester. My thanks to that university and to my students (basking in their glory, reflected on me) -  the confidence it gives definitely works to the advantage of one, health included. Next, don't I act swiftly and decisively when it matters the most (to establish that I am at the peak of health) - to confront termite or ant colony and last but not least the snakes? The ordeal needs taking help of maintenance and security staff or flexing rod and muscles to solve the matter then and there. I belong to that hall of fame who killed a snake in bed room single-handedly (Again \"Bhawnako Samjho\" - used both the hands but no other help except family members), a rare feat in the campus. Recently drove a big snake away from our garden and kept working on the holes for days (each time it was resurfacing). Finally the combination of bleaching powder and stamping of ground (heard that they are deaf but sensitive to vibration) after each day's work out made that big snake give up. To take the ant colony out of quarter, I am following a policy where I am doing spraying activity on one side and keeping the other side (towards the periphery) free. The ants appear to be intelligent enough to understand in which direction I am asking them to go.We never used 'ant colony optimization' algorithm to score a point anywhere in our research - thus, no pricking of conscience!What else? How to prove that I am doing my best and doing enough? Kashmir, Vizag, Darjeeling in summer 2011, winter 2011, summer 2012 - isn't that great? It is the quality that matters. One should not worry if 4N, 5D could have been extended or Peling, Gangtok could have been included in the itinerary. One has to keep something available for the next vacation!I think that I have proven my point. Bad cholesterol at border line high is much better than having urea, creatinine crossing the limit, if we know what makes it sweet and sudden. Maintaining blood pressure at 140/90 for about a decade now without medication is no mean feat! More so if you have history of high B.P. in your family! Today evening there is ultrasonography test. I am sure that I shall prove my critics wrong on this count too and it is no surprise that the critics will be the happiest to hear that. Till then enjoy the pics taken during morning walk outs in our beautiful campus and our new quarter (often accompanied by my daughter who inspires, participates - in fact, I had to invent one work out, 'madness at large' which she finds hilarious - don't ask for demo., please!!!). The place behind garage in the last picture is the arena."},
{"title": "Lori for Girl Child", "date": "Wednesday, May 9, 2012", "text": "This evening I was listening to a prime time television debate on a national news channel. Director Satyajit of 'Satyamev Jayate' was articulate in defending criticism on Rs. 6 crore (or 20 crore in some other estimate) of Advertizement spend to promote the show or earning Rs. 60 crore of sponsorship for the production house by working on public emotion. He strongly defended what comes first to Aamir - calculation or heart. To him, Aamir follows his heart to get into a project and then does his calculation and not the other way. As Satyajit said, there are more hope than cynicism around the show. He need not answer on television what a critic in another place said about the intensity of the make-up of Aamir in the show, that the show is making audience to cry and not angry. One commentator in the television debate said that the problem is with the civil society itself, their mindset. One has to wait and watch the effect of such a show when the initial euphoria subsides, if it can make any difference to \"Sab chalta hai\" attitude. The census report on gender imbalance was always before us. We chose to ignore. The endorsement of a star brings the issue to the forefront but it requires a coordinated and sustained movement to capitalize on it. Will this issue be overshadowed by twelve other issues that come up in twelve succeeding episodes?To me, each one is entitled to try in his own way and deserves a chance. This effort from Aamir or the TV Channel is not putting a stop in existing efforts and may complement them, enrich them. Then why complain? Is the responsibility entirely of him? What on earth then you and I will do? He is sensitizing people and giving some sort of start to get us involved and not forcing us to think him as a messiah. I personally do not believe that a show is enough unless it is backed by field level work. We have to see if some such thing is already planned or a network of people, motivated to take the causes forward, emerges with the progress of the show. Aamir has wide fan following and huge acceptability for being serious about what he takes up. The fast track court he talked about may only be the beginning. On making money from sponsors, I won't be surprised if the amount minus production and other cost is donated for various causes brought up in the show. It will be disastrous for his image and future productions, to be seen as one who is talks about social evils to make money out of that. I don't see any reason to be critical on that front.One research talked about the effect of setting a different but important goal. The rising population of India encouraged small family norms and some penalty for having more than two children. The negative impact is reported here (Link). The male member of the family carries the family name (it gets changed for female after marriage) in Indian family. This  too has its effect. We do find narrower family/caste/religion/group (e.g. iitians) identity prevailing over our higher identity of humanity. Protecting interest of a particular community by the community members is in our very nature and it is no surprise that a distorted form of it does not mind getting the benefit at the cost of others. The UNICEF report (Link) was reflected in Aamir's show minus the snippets like \"There have been only two convictions - a fine of 300 rupees ($7) and another fine of 4,000 rupees ($98) -- from over 400 cases lodged under the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act.\" The 2011 state wise sex ratio in the country can be found here (Link) which also compares with 2001 data and shows percentage increase/decrease. From 933 per 1000 in 2001 it marginally improved to 940 per thousand. What is worse and does not meet the eye easily is male female sex ratio of children under 6 years of age. This is just 914 female child per 1000 male child in 2011 census compared to 927 per thousand in 2001 (Link). This dropped 1.40% during the last decade while allover sex ratio raised 0.75% in India (due to higher mortality of aging male population). This we also found in our NSS, IIT Kharagpur field study while talking to health centre workers. We take less care of our girl child and and do our bit to see that only the male child survives.The national capital, Delhi cannot feel proud with its skewed sex ratio (866 female per 1000 male) and we had seen the plight of a doctor belonging to educated elite in the Aamir show. What is that which asks one of the best college in Delhi (St. Stephens) to propose 40 percent reservation for boys? The girls are outnumbering them in such proportion that the male population needs to be preserved there. India Today report can be found here (Link). And if the argument put forward by college authority is found acceptable which states, \"The issue was brought to the notice of the faculty members because of the gender imbalance within most classrooms. Currently, 65 per cent of our student population is girls. This is a reflection of the longstanding global trend where more women tend to opt for humanities. Such a lopsided situation could affect the dynamics of the classroom and the way one approaches the subject.\" then why nobody talks about reservation of girls in IITs who must be finding it difficult to attend residential intensive IIT-JEE coaching at different states for being girls and are thus are outdone by boys? How is that they do well in 10+2 Board examinations compared to boys and do not get counted when it comes to IIT-JEE which follows same syllabi but different question pattern?We need to watch if the 'Satyamev Jayate' show goes deep enough so that really the 'Truth triumphs' and addresses the root cause or talks only about taking care of symptoms. Yes, the symptoms are to be treated. We need to take paracetamol to bring down the temperature when in fever but it reappears again unless the main disease is controlled. Yesterday it was preference for boy child, today it is an advertizement (18th Jan., 2012 Times of India report : Link) where a couple asks for sperm of an IITian to get a genius(!) born in the family, tomorrow we may ask for having right DNAs in place to have fairer colour, certain physique, more amount of grey matter and what not in the designer's baby of future. The main issue is our desire to get into a position of advantage vis-a-vis others by using whatever might we possess, denying others their rights and dues, not respecting the concept of equality - the essential fabric of humanity.How can we become more human, less selfish? The golden rule says, \"Do unto others as you would have them do to you.\" If we forget that now and then, we need to look at how we got educated, how values got transmitted to me and work on that - improving the process how the nations educates itself and its future generation from the childhood. Does the society bow to an honest, sincere, hard working person who may be earning just enough to maintain his family? Or does the society treat someone with higher esteem who is simply rich? Today, do the parents tell their children to grow up like Bose, Gandhi - live a life of austerity and dedicate themselves to the service of the nation or to grow up us XYZ who amass huge amount of wealth, live a lavish life like a star?For an issue like this, star cast may take us to the door but does not make the door open. I would like to believe that the star himself will emerge transformed at the end of the show through a process of evolution - the high make-up melting into tanned skin and soils making its appearance in the sleeves. We as actors work on the situations. But the role of subject and object often changes during the course. The situation starts working on us and become the actor. I feel very positive to hear in the TV debate, a voice from the people's representative, a young lady from Punjab, narrating how empowerment of women through skill development is changing equation in her village constituency. She said, \"Earlier there used to be lori if only a boy child was born. Now there is lori for girl child too.\"Let me end this post with a letter of Vivekananda, one of the greatest social reformer of modern India who lived only for 39 years. He had a clear vision of traits required for a would be social reformers when he says (Link), \"If you wish to be a true reformer, three things are necessary. The first is to feel. Do you really feel for your brothers? Do you really feel that there is so much misery in the world, so much ignorance and superstition? Do you really feel that men are your brothers? Does this idea come into your whole being? Does it run with your blood? Does it tingle in your veins? Does it course through every nerve and filament of your body? Are you full of that idea of sympathy? If you are, that is only the first step. You must think next if you have found any remedy. The old ideas may be all superstition, but in and round these masses of superstition are nuggets of gold and truth. Have you discovered means by which to keep that gold alone, without any of the dross? If you have done that, that is only the second step; one more thing is necessary. What is your motive? Are you sure that you are not actuated by greed of gold, by thirst for fame or power? Are you really sure that you can stand to your ideals and work on, even if the whole world wants to crush you down? Are you sure you know what you want and will perform your duty, and that alone, even if your life is at stake? Are you sure that you will persevere so long as life endures, so long as there is one pulsation left in the heart? Then you are a real reformer, you are a teacher, a Master, a blessing to mankind.\"Vivekananda is writing this letter to an Irish lady, Ms. Margaret Noble who later became Sister Nivedita and dedicated herself fully for the upliftment of India. Vivekananda wanted women to take centre stage in looking for solutions to the problems that are their very own. Nivedita started a girl school in 1898 when education of girl child was unheard of, yes - it is true. In her benediction Vivekananda wrote, \"Be thou to India's future son / The mistress, servant, friend in one.\"*                                 *                              *                            *                            *                     *                                                                                                                               7th June, 1896.DEAR MISS NOBLE,My ideal indeed can be put into a few words and that is: to preach untomankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.This world is in chain of superstition. I pity the oppressed, whether man orwoman, and I pity more the oppressors.One idea that I see clear as daylight is that misery is caused by ignoranceand nothing else. Who will give the world light? Sacrifice in the past has beenthe Law, it will be, alas, for ages to come. The earth's bravest and best willhave to sacrifice themselves for the good of many, for the welfare of all.Buddhas by the hundred are necessary with eternal love and pity.Religions of the world have become lifeless mockeries. What the world wantsis character. The world is in need of those whose life is one burning love,selfless. That love will make every word tell like thunderbolt.It is no superstition with you, I am sure, you have the making in you of aworld-mover, and others will also come. Bold words and bolder deeds are what wewant. Awake, awake, great ones! The world is burning with misery. Can yousleep? Let us call and call till the sleeping gods awake, till the god withinanswers to the call. What more is in life? What greater work? The details cometo me as I go. I never make plans. Plans grow and work themselves. I only say,awake, awake!May all blessings attend you for ever!Yours affectionately,VIVEKANANDA."},
{"title": "Memento", "date": "Tuesday, May 8, 2012", "text": "Part I It bordered on disbelief. \"Sir, we the outgoing batch of students, would like to meet you and hand over a memento.\" It was yesterday morning and I was attending a seminar.  Thanked those students and requested them to come to my office during the break. We had pics together, went to an eatery and chatted at length from what they may expect in an industry job to how they can offer their first-hand service to a village / slum school around their work place or in their native place. They should not be satisfied just by donating money to some organization - first hand knowledge, regular interaction, association will help grow oneness and someday while taking food for themselves, in their thought will come, \"Did the boy / girl of that village / slum who is a kind of loner have his / her food today?\" It is this concern without which nation building can have all necessary but not sufficient conditions.Then came the phone call. An alumnus who spent few years in industry got selected for the best business school of the country. He thanked for whatever little I could contribute. It was entirely his effort. The idea also came from him. I still vividly remember the evening when his team met me for the first time. I just tried to see that their idea gets conceptualized and implemented as I had some experience of field level work. We chatted for sometime and he wished to know my availability to decide when he would come down to KGP. Thank you. May you attain more responsible positions and serve to the best of your capacity.This evening got an email from an UG student who just completed 2nd year. I was with them for a semester in their journey through one particular course. His mail from an Uttarakhand town said, \"The course actually gave me a taste of real engineering stuff especially doing some (of) the matlab programs for voice recognition and processing. Thanks a lot for creating a good learning ambiance in the classroom.\" These are my mementos received in last 36 hours. Each of these count. Allow me to borrow a stanza from Tennyson poem, 'Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead' (Link) - Rose a nurse of ninety years,/Set his child upon her knee—/Like summer tempest came her tears—/‘Sweet my child, I live for thee.’       Part IIThere is a reason for disbelief that I mentioned in the opening statement of this post. The steep target of 'Vision 2020', which the institute has set for itself, needs all of us, the teachers, students, alumni and other stake holders to put up a massive quality improvement effort. This starts with quality consciousness, tying up loose ends, if any within the system at every tier. There are and will be issues. Let us see what we can do within our sphere of influence. I remember the TQM (Total Quality Management) concept of Tata Steel, the organization I served for more than four years. A single drop of oil spillage is to get counted and efforts are put on to stop the same. Besides, we are the best in the country and we have to think and act like the best in every step as we are role model before many. The vibration, the very atmosphere here should induce people, students and teachers alike, to go after the greatest of ideas (does not matter if all of them are not successful) and none to remain satisfied till the best is seen.It is our failure if we cannot motivate the students enough collectively and their world gets divided into 'Load' and 'Peace'. On personal front, I need to work harder and be friendlier to explain students why quality is important for them, us and all and it is just not an obsession but an integral part of healthy way of living. Every step, small or big counts - even if it is switching off the fan before leaving the class room each day, everyday, not taking a right turn at a road island etc. In Tata Steel I heard: Do the right things right, the first time and every time. The external discipline is equally important to get internal discipline right else there always is a chance to get drifted which is not unheard of. Enlightenment is not anything that will descend from the sky. We have to act like a one from today and now. This is not to say that we lack quality in IITs. We are unmatched at national level and IITs are pride of the nation. Our students are model before others in discipline, academic prowess and we enjoy the best teacher-student relationship here. But we cannot sit back and relax on the laurels of the past. The future will become more competitive. Also the aim is to get counted among top x institutions of the world. Let us, the teachers, the students, the alumni and all stake holders work together and we can make it happen.Part IIIOne of my PhD student gave me this book to read - Affective Computing by Rosalind W. Picard of MIT Media Lab. (I can proudly proclaim that I learn more from my students than they learn from me - that is the dividend one can enjoy for being a part of a premier institution.) The books aims to develop a framework in giving emotional abilities to computer. One arm of our research group works on identifying emotion from speech which drew our interest into the title. The author writes  about popular notion on emotion - \"Acting 'emotionally' implies acting irrationally, with poor judgement. Emotional response tend to be inappropriate, and even embarrassing. At first blush, emotion seems like the last thing we would want in an intelligent machine.\" In the preface she writes, \" ...the new scientific evidence is that too little emotion can impair decision making. This conclusion is not obvious from introspection. It comes from studies of unusual patients who essentially have too little emotion. These patients, in rather eerie ways, are similar to today's computers - particularly in how they malfunction.\" Part IVWe were in a party mood this afternoon after submission of grades of all subjects within deadline. It was a battle against time as I was averaging fifteen answer-script checking each day. In my letter to students where I arranged display of answer-script evaluation, I wrote \"...an answer-script tells lots of things - the strength and weakness of a student as seen by a teacher. It won't be possible tomorrow to address each of you individually (needs 15-30 min. for each of the 113 students). If you are interested, you may visit day after tomorrow or later by taking an appointment (you may try without appointment too but I may be in some other meeting).\" I was particularly happy that I could explain the students how the evaluation was done and also showed histogram of marks, grades etc. It appeared that the students appreciated the whole of it.Therefore, was in a mood to disturb others!!! Who could be the best person but the faculty who never visits tea-shop, not seen in any adda and is always flocked with students! No wonder, he draws the maximum cheer from the students in farewell functions. He is always very kind to give his time for such adda when I bang his room and I must say that I have no hidden agenda to make him more involved with the Dept./Institute. There were three final year students and the adda became brainstorming on how we can improve, what we can do as an individual, what we can do collectively, what are our pain points, how can we structure ourselves to address those pain points and explain the students in an unambiguous manner the milestones to be reached at various timelines so that they have clarity from the very beginning.We also discussed that the competitive environment is to bring the best out of us and not anything less noble to look for a win at any cost. We have to rise above personal/group/Dept./... interest and embrace superior human values. Others may or may not follow. There will be pain down the road, may be pain of a loner who does not find anybody by his side. But has anything been born without pain? What about us, ourselves, when we came out of mother's womb? In a facebook message, an ex-student, now a proud mother writes, \"A human body can bear up to 45 del(unit) of pain. But at the time of giving birth, a woman feels up to 57 del of pain. This is similar to twenty bones getting fractured at a time.\" Today is Tagore's 151st birth anniversary. He wrote, \"jakhan tumi bandchhile tar se je bhishan byatha\" i.e. when you were tuning the string (of a musical instrument which was out of tune e.g. guitar, sitar) there was so much of pain! If we agree that there is a need to tune our instrument, we cannot avoid the pain in the process. But what should excite us is the symphony that will fill the air once the instruments are tuned.Part VTo wind up the post, let me get back to the table in the eatery where we (me and outgoing batch of students - about ten of them) were having a sip at cold drink and discussing what had been their experience here and what they see for themselves in the future. I asked if they were challenged enough. They were in all praise of IIT system which takes their UG experience far and forward. The breadth, the depth, the assignments, the lab.s. Then there was a question if they explored something out of their own interest (not prompted by teacher). IIT provides huge infrastructure and each of us nurtures lot of questions from childhood - could be related to cosmos, say singularity associated with blackhole or graphology, making prediction from hand writing etc. Also, I asked if they discussed each others' projects, if there was cross-fertilization of ideas,  if there is a scope to combine the findings of two projects (we teachers are probably conditioned to think in a certain away, the out-of-box  solutions can be expected from fresh minds). I also requested to take their jobs seriously. My own industry experience says that there are so much of complementary knowledge to acquire there to complete another quadrant of personality development.I cannot blame if some of them thought if they made the right decision to give a memento to me and get drawn into a discussion like this :-) After all, their would be job profiles are miles apart from all these. But the inquisitiveness, exploring solutions as a trait will add to the profile of any job. These days one may need to change jobs. Also the domain knowledge always comes handy in trying times. In IT jobs too, there is a gradual but certain shift from coding to more of domain knowledge based solutions. Finally, Sri Ma Sarada (Link) said, \"Jake rakho, se rakhe.\" i.e. If you take care of some thing today, that will take care of you some other day.Sometimes I wonder if there is too-muchness in all of these, if there is a potential of getting 'misunderstood' (as told by my colleague). The feeling of too-muchness is but relative. What is too much in some place may be very normal in another place. The question is, what sort of baseline we are targeting to?"},
{"title": "Resume and Blog", "date": "Wednesday, May 2, 2012", "text": "Today morning received a mail from none less than ieee-career-alert@ieee.org, as a part of IEEE membership service, where the very first article is titled, 'How a Personal Blog Can Boost Your Career'. The article says, \"What better way to introduce yourself to thousands of people than by giving them a window into how you think, how you write, whether you come up with good ideas, and how adept you are at marketing? That’s what a personal blog is, after all. “Some people have suggested that a personal blog will someday replace the resume,” says a Jobacle.com article. For a potential employer, your posts—as well as your ability to cultivate an audience—provide concrete examples ofwhat you might contribute to their firm. Bloggers can also benefit from the built-in avenue for relationship building: the comment section.\" and provides this link to read on.This brings us to a fundamental question -Why blog? It is not mere philosophy to have an answer like - I blog because I exist. Didn't we hear much before the era of blogging - I think, therefore I am. Once blogging becomes a resume building exercise, we may have - I blog what I do not think, rather what I want others to think of me.This gives me an opportunity to ask myself what exactly is the purpose of my blog. I did not and do not want to force myself to set any specific target to be achieved by this blog. I wanted to share with people, specially the youth, what I feel if I have the luxury :-) of spending sometime on the keyboard. A person near twenty may feel curious about what is there around forty. If I look back at the very first post dated Sept. 05, 2007 (Link), I felt that day that everybody should hear what I had heard from Chiranjeev Maharaj (Swami Satyabodhananda of Ramakrishna Mission) and felt the urge of starting this blog. The post remembering my father (Link) had been the closest to my heart and brings tears whenever I get an opportunity to go through it.Having been brought up in an environment where organization discipline is the key (Link) and working in private sector for more than six years where discipline is the final word, I believe that the organization hierarchy is to be respected and the solution to a problem lies within the organization framework. However, no two organizations are same and it is an ever-learning process. The organization itself may find itself at a cross road at some point of time in history, searching for an identity, somewhat confused in defining role of its hierarchy and the command structure. As an individual's character is tested in trying times, the organization which has a persona of its own, gets tested during this period. This is the time to take everybody into confidence, to stick together as a unit, to contribute in a constructive manner through no-superficial engagement and meaningful dialogue, to ignore small blips and not being sarcastic about it, to look at bigger picture rather than settling old scores, to help the organization to evolve in a smooth way for the betterment of all.Extending the existential issue further, if the organization / institution is the body and I am a part / limb, then when organization dies, me too. I exist because the institution exists. I am not standing on void without any support from anybody. A part of me dies if my family is ruined. A part of me dies of my work place is ruined. A part of me dies if the society around, the country is ruined. Let us make blood flow through all veins. Let us be a part of the big churning - the pain that makes the butterfly coming out of a caterpillar when the evolution goes in the right direction. Let us do our bit to set the direction of the evolution right. I again quote Mahatma Gandhi to end this post even if I sound repetitive (the previous post on IIT JEE) , \"Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may       have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of       any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a       control over his own life and destiny?\""},
{"title": "Thoughts on IIT JEE", "date": "Tuesday, May 1, 2012", "text": "Tried to make few changes based on inputs that I received later. I probably should have indicated  that the first one was only a beta version of the post :-)  .... A follow up post appears here (Link).Thanks to all the contributors!The decision making process for new IIT JEE appears more interesting to me than the proposals themselves. Each of the proposal I read in various forums has its own merit and all contributors deserve thanks from the IIT community. It shows the amount of concern people have for IITs and this goodwill, perhaps is the single most achievement of IIT system in 60 years of its existence. Contribution develops an ownership and when you own it, you care for its well being. Thank you all the contributors in various forums. You own us, you won us!The dilemmaI tend to agree with almost all the proposals when I find how strongly the arguments are put in their favour, even if they contradict each other!! The decision makers need to take a final decision after weighing pluses and minuses of each proposal. The maxima and minima of different objectives being articulated may not converge to the same point. For example, the maxima for getting the best students to IIT and the minima to be achieved on coaching centre effect may not lie at the same point. There must be some cost-benefit analysis for this before it swings from one direction to other.Should I, should I not?Do I have an opinion of my own? I believe that I need NOT have an opinion on everything and comment on it. I may not have sufficient expertize. It could be so that I could not study the issue enough or I lack ground raw data to build an hypothesis. However, being a part of IIT system for long, taking IIT-JEE in 1986, graduating from Electronics and ECE of IITKGP in 1990, working for PhD here during 1994-1999 and serving as a faculty member for little less than 10 years now, I may share a few words not as an expert, but as a simple onlooker who is with the flow.I don't know what I say is in synch with the time - it may be ahead of or it may belong to the time we have left behind. But history repeats! Does it not? :-) Not my cup of teaIt may not be easy to curb coaching class effect by introducing any change in IIT-JEE. This is more of a social issue. The parents who can afford, will go all out to give any extra edge, even if it is minuscule 1-2%, for their wards in a highly competitive examination like this so that the probability of getting admitted increases. Way back in 1986, I have seen parents who can afford, engaging three private tutors for single subject - each tutor was assumed to be expert in one aspect of the subject. The corporatization of coaching came to take advantage of this space where entrepreneurs saw an opportunity . If some benovalent group provides free but quality IIT-JEE coaching then there will be coaching centres to prepare students to get admission into those free coaching centres. I read in some post (Link) of Times of India that higher dowry associated with IITian label, is the motivation for some. I believe that with the single child family on the rise, the burgeoning and aspiring middle class creating an assertive space for itself and the high stake involved in clearing the exam. will not allow the coaching centres to close, even if you, I and they wish to. They will evolve to fit into any new paradigm to cater to the demand of you and me.Core issue asking attention We may speak ill of many things, but when our own turn comes we usually do not fall short of using it, to make our son / daughter reach an advantageous position relative to other children who may be equal or more meritorious. This is my take on the society which is yet to stress on man-making, character-building education and is trying to address the symptoms - not the cause. My little experience is that the young are very good, are more ready to embrace an egalitarian society, give people their due and they need to be nurtured well from early age. We elders inject selfishness into them to protect our interest and cry foul later when they become too selfish, more than what we wanted to make of them.We expect that all challenging jobs will be taken care of child of somebody else, not mine. All comforts and no hardship for my child in life's journey - after all, it is a competitive environment where other children are opponents! But, in this land of Mahabharata, a son goes to his mother to seek blessings before a do-or-die battle. Life's sadhana, tapasya made the mother so powerful that had she wished the son would have won. But in her lips came, \"Yatha Dharma, Tatha Jay\" i.e. whoever is fighting for the dharma (truth, justice) should win and she knew that the son was not exactly following dharma. I am talking about Mother Gandhari when son Duryodhana goes to her before the battle of Kurkshetra. And we know how Dhritarashtra's unfulfilled ambition was channelized through Duryodhana. I cannot help if it sounds idealistic, but we cannot achieve an ideal system (the motive behind IIT JEE or any reform) without adopting idealism ourselves, in our dealing with our children who are the future of the nation. It will be like pushing the garbage from one corner of the room to other corner and never getting rid of it. With reform in the education sector on the anvil, we can give a deep, hard look at the core issue without which the much discussed 'inclusive growth' will just be a matter of statistics obtained from parametric adjustment of few control variables. The future of the nation depends on how we educate our youngsters, how we educate ourselves before that.More than ritual If we try to go beyond ritualistic celebration of 150th birth anniversary of Vivekananda, it will do us a world of good to listen to him and direct policy implementation related to education on what he said as essence of education, \"We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.\" We need not interpret the last point of the sentence as making enough money. Standing on one's own feet goes much beyond that in making men out of boys. If we want to listen to Tagore who conceptualized Vishwa Bharati, we hear, \"The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence\". The very first point of Radhakrishnan Report (1949, Link) on education says, \"The quality of a civilisation depends not on the material equipment or the political machinery but on the character of men. The major task of education is the improvement of character.\" He further says, \"Education isthe means by which we can tidy up our minds, acquire information, as well as asense of values. Education should give us not only elements of generalknowledge or technical skills but also impart to us that bent of mind, thatattitude of reason , that spirit of democracy which will make us responsiblecitizens of our country. A true democracy is a community of citizens differingfrom one another but all bound to a common goal.\" It is high time to do what is necessary to benefit from the wisdom our greatest teachers. For us, the teachers, the Radhakrishnan's birthday should be more than the celebration of Teacher's Day to remember what he said, \"The right kind of teacher... not only loves his subject, he loves also those whom he teaches. His success will be measured not in terms of percentage of passes alone... but equally through the quality of life and character of men and women whom he has taught.\" or \"The real teacher is like the gardener who nurtures the plant and not a carpenter who cuts pieces of wood to fit into certain locations .... Unless the tutor stimulates thinking rather than mere memorizing, deeper intellectual interests rather than aversion to thought, better perception of values rather than in appreciation, he serves no useful purpose but may nourish wrong habits which will be difficult to eradicate. The tutor has to bear in mind that he is not merely teaching a subject, but is educating men and women to take their places as intelligent citizens of the nation.\" and ask ourselves how far we are conforming to this.  Back to specificsIIT-JEE can focus on achieving what it is supposed to achieve i.e. getting the right kind of students for themselves. Will inclusion of board exam. marks solve the problem? It may. What about the concern of some that there may be issues with some board? The answer given is that this exercise will make those boards do better. To me, it is a risky proposition in a high voltage situation like this. But the proposer must have thought about a way else there may be litigation one after another. Will it give rise to state quota? Nothing wrong if we are talking about inclusive growth and it may not compromise with meritocracy too as we the top 1-2% of a board will be under consideration. But the smarter among the population may try to migrate to certain boards which may appear to provide some extra edge. Probably, higher board percentage (than 60%) or percentile as eligibility to IIT-JEE can be a middle ground.Virtue of ISEET I like the idea of the pan-India common test like ISEET which if treated as precursor to IIT-JEE, becomes important and gets proper recognition. I like it because this prepares some sort of national level merit list and takes away much of the load from All India Rank of IIT-JEE and obsession around it. AIEEE is there but it does not get that much of an attention as it is not linked to IIT. Whether IIT will conduct another test with top x percent student of ISEET etc. and with short and/or long answer type questions is another issue. Probably they should conduct such a test to decide and it should be a subjective type. I see all coaching centre executives seeing red in this proposition. I wonder if they worry more about something else than subjectivity of evaluation. People who talk about golden days of IIT-JEE where best of the best could be selected, are talking about those days where subjective test were held. Also when the nation keeps watching every move related to IIT-JEE there is no such scope. The debate we had before was not on evaluation of answer-script but arriving at cut-off marks. And now perhaps IIT-JEE is the most transparent of all. My interaction with students here show that they appreciate the importance of subjective test and not worried about subjectivity as part marks are well defined in the evaluation procedure. If we are talking about evaluation of scripts of top x% then it can certainly be ensured. On one hand we talk about incorporation of 40% marks from Board Exam., and on the other hand we doubt the credibility of examiners of the nation's most credible entrance exam. - it does not go together. That the coaching centres do not want it (if I could hear the noise) tells that this is the solution.Importance of 1st Year Those who are in IIT know that all Dept.s are not equal in demand. I would like to go with the suggestion where institute is chosen based on ISEET IIT-JEE rank and Dept. is chosen after 1st year based on 1st year rank. This will give a major incentive to study in the 1st year where students tend to relax after rigorous IIT-JEE preparation. Once they slip in 1st year, with no parental control and new found freedom with high bandwidth internet and LAN working on body and mind, it is very difficult to recover. If they get into the habit of studying once in IIT, a new environment (parents too will be watchful as a lot is at stake on 1st year result), they are expected to continue with it. The other rationale is that the students go through common curriculum, stay in same environment in 1st year and thus there is a 'level playing field' (Link). The best way to judge their relative merit is at that time which will reduce the noise in merit list due to wide diversity of their background when they enter IIT system.Update: Had a discussion with a group of 2nd year IITKGP UG students this morning on various aspects of these. They do not like allocation of branch after 1st year. As a student they may want to go to a newer IIT to get a branch of their choice if rank is low and movement across IITs may be difficult. However, they fully subscribe to the idea of giving more incentive to 1st year result. Their suggestion is to increase the current 10% Dept. change (from a less preferred branch to a more preferred branch) option to 20% so that a larger number of students have a realistic chance to go for Dept. change and work for that. The students appear to have a more practical sense than me on this and I am sure on many other things too :-) From the view point of a commonerHow does people unconnected to IIT-JEE, who outnumber IIT-JEE aspirants, look at all these? The common man in the street is entitled to think that these public funded institutions with huge capital and operational expenditure behind them, should do more than shaping the career of certain select individuals. How can the RoI (Return on Investment) for the country be improved? The Mission statement at IIT Madras website (Link) says,------The purpose of educational programmes in the IITs should beto develop in each student mastery of fundamentals, versatility of mind, motivation for learning, intellectual discipline and self-reliance which provide the best foundation for continuing professional achievement;to provide a liberal; as well as a professional education so that each student acquires a respect for moral values, a sense of their duties as a citizen, a feeling for taste and style, and a better human understanding. All these are required for leadership;to send forth men and women of the highest professional competence with a breath of learning and a character to deal constructively with issues, and problems anticipated in the next decade relevant to the programmes of development of our country. -------We need to ensure that we have the right ingredients in place to achieve this purpose in letter and spirit. Since the nation looks up to IITs as role model, such achievement will have a snow ball effect and will positively influence secondary and higher secondary education. The leaders i.e. IITs should show that its students acquire 'a respect for moral values, a sense of their duties as a citizen, a feeling for taste and style, and a better human understanding ... a character to deal constructively with issues, and problems anticipated in the next decade relevant to the programmes of development of our country'.Maximizing RoI for the countryIs competence in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics enough to ensure right kind of human input to IITs? Is it possible to inculcate the character qualities at UG level at IIT or should it start earlier? Could there be any way to evaluate that? Could there be a personal interview of 2y (y = no. to be admitted) people, similar to current GATE interview which will look into extra-curricular, involvement in community service activity, attitude? Who will conduct these tests? The IIT faculty needs to be trained. Even if the student do not enter the IIT system with the above character qualities, it is the duty of IIT faculty to impart them and thus the training cannot be avoided. The more we empower, the more is our responsibility to see that a student is groomed as a responsible citizen of the country and a good human being. Each IIT has extra-curricular program at 1st year level like NCC, NSS etc. It can be revitalized as it provides the scope for the two worlds to meet - the privileged and the underprivileged. Due weightage can be given to participation to this which is to get counted in the Dept. selection.The pitfallsDoesn't the proposed flow chart contain flaws? Yes. But it may have less flaws and can be worked upon. My experience is following: In any two populations A and B of sufficiently large size (say 1000 or so), the top z% of B will always be better than bottom z% of A. Consider, A as the ones who clear IIT-JEE and B who do not clear IIT-JEE but some other exam. The aim of the selection process is to minimize z but it can never be made zero. Coming back to the flow chart, one possible criticism could be the increased stress level in a multi-tier test. Closer scrutinee will show addition of only one personal interview to get admitted and that carries only 10% of the weightage. This is to send a message that the attitude and extra-curricular are important and students should develop healthy life style in parallel. The offering of Dept. at the end of 1st year is to tell that getting into IIT is not enough - one has to work hard here too. If required, the end of 1st year ranking may consider x% weightage from 1st year score and (100-x)% from IIT-JEE.Past projected to future Let us see the genesis of IIT JEE and how students were admitted when it first came into being in the year 1955. We may see that it had a flavour of what is talked about here. I quote from one article of April, 2012 issue of Twastha, a journal of Technology Alumni Association, IIT Kharagpur. In this, a senior IIT KGP faculty pays tribute to the institute.\"Admission to the institute were on considerations of merit only. Till 1954 admissions were made on the basis of recommendations of Regional Interviewing Committees which met at 9 different centres throughout the country. On 3rd July, 1954 the Board of Governors resolved that from 1955 admission be made on the result of a competitive examination held at various centres at the country followed by an interview and medical examinations of candidates successful in the written examination. However, on the suggestion of the Ministry of Education, it was agreed that 15 percent of the seats be reserved for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students and 37.5 percent of seats be reserved for backward sates. Under technical cooperation scheme of Colombo Plan some seats were reserved for students from Nepal, Burma and Indonesia.\"EndnoteLet me come back to the decision making process with which I started this post.  IITs should do what it needs to do to serve the country as a whole so that the benefit is accrued to the common man and not to select individuals. Today at the cross road, when decision is being made to get the finest manpower for the finest institution of the nation, it is worth remembering father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi, \"Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may       have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of       any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a       control over his own life and destiny?\""},

May you all become worthy children of this country and we all feel proud of you. May you all nurture in you how this institute came up in a detention camp of freedom fighters, where two of them laid lives when British police fired at them, where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose visited. May you all remember your role as a maker of this nation. The country cannot afford to make the best of its education infrastructure available to all. It is given to the chosen few, the most capable ones, who you are, the blessed, the deserving ... with a hope, with an urge that the enriched you, your capacity  will help raising the country, your fellow countrymen - the suffering millions, the downtrodden, the ones who also deserve access to education, employment, health, shelter, a space for themselves ... who are waiting with expectations in those tearful eyes..... in overcrowded general compartment of trains, in long queues of Govt. hospitals....when the educated, the empowered ...you, will reach out to them.I am sure, wherever you are, you will carry 'India' with you and will not leave any opportunity to see that India achieves the much desired inclusive growth ... beyond islands of excellence ... creating opportunities for all. Tall task indeed ... that's why the hope rests on the tallest amongst us, young graduating IITians. Your batch, previous and succeeding batches - together you are a great force, you can and I am sure you will. The nation will see in you not only leaders in technological field but leaders who are 'Dedicated to the service of the Nation' on their graduating day, as inscribed in the magnificent main building that beholds all of us. Let me end this little speech :-) with what we all KGPians remember by heart, the famous quote from Pandit J. L. Nehru's first convocation address, \"Here in the place of that Hijli Detention Camp stands the fine monument  of India, representing India's urges,India's future in the making. this  picture seems to me symbolical of the changes that are coming to  India.\" May you all lead a happy, prosperous and meaningful life. May God bless you.The old building of IIT Kharagpur during World War II, a picture from pre-independence era. The making of the new building. The main gate was in place before others. The making of the signature tower. The F-116 (Bhatnagar Auditorium) entrance to main building is in place."},
{"title": "Instant Gratification", "date": "Sunday, April 8, 2012", "text": "Have been quite busy this year to be regular with my posts. The following I read today morning in The Hindu (Link) on sad demise of an IIT-M student. Dr. Vijayakumar has raised a very pertinent point in the last paragraph of the report which is reproduced below. If possible, I shall try to share my observation on this later. All stake holders - students, parents, teachers must act together in imparting basic values of life from an early age. The 'career only' approach to our education process leaves yawning gap in the life and character of youngsters. Each of us is responsible in someway and must think beyond that it had happened to somebody else's son / daughter. We need to act early and now.---- QUOTE----The reason driving students to committing suicide may not always be  related to academics. “Most students in IITs have slogged really hard to  get there . When they come here, they feel there are many others better  than them, which would not have been the case back home. Coping with  those realities becomes difficult,” Dr. Vijayakumar said. Also, the  issue of handling relationships is important. “Youngsters today are so  used to getting everything instantly, right from their pizza to money,  that they want the same in relationships too. Educational institutes  should help them cope with the failures of everyday life.” she said.----END QUOTE----"},
{"title": "Alumni Meet", "date": "Sunday, January 8, 2012", "text": "IIT remained dream institution for generations and will continue to remain so. The conviction is there - for being a part of UG fraternity, research students and member of the faculty. Of course, all the stake holders need to work hard showing unity of thought, words and action. Alumni is a great strength for IIT Kharagpur. Besides their financial help, the experience they share with younger IITians are valuable. Giving BackHad it not clashed with NSS time slot, I would have attended the morning function of the alumni meet on 7th Jan. (SAT). I had the responsibility of visiting three villages where three new program officers are taking charge of respective NSS units. I set off at 9:30 AM from home and could return only at 1:15 PM. In one of these villages, the poorest under Gopali Gram Panchayat, we had an interesting experience. We met a proud father who was not exactly complaining about her daughter. The daughter, Asha works as a house-maid in IIT Kharagpur campus. She spends whatever she can save over a period of time for the poorest of the poor in the village. Soon we met Asha who came back from campus to take lunch at village home. She shyly showed us one roofing she sponsored recently for one family which costs her Rs. 4000 (the mud wall was okay, the house is in the first picture with Asha, Program Officer and NSS students in front, beside the children jostling without going to schools - right to education??). She showed one more house in dilapidated condition which she is taking up now (the left one in second picture). These straw roofs lasts for a year or so. The asbestos roofing is more permanent but costs Rs. 15000 and is beyond her capacity or the time frame required is beyond the urgency of the situation.  Meeting PointLater in the day, as a part of Alumni Meet, I was revisiting what Asha is doing for her village. Somewhere, we can compare that with our alumni giving back to alma mater. One is higher in relative term and the other is higher in absolute term. Can there be a meeting point somewhere? Few weeks back, I was discussing something similar with the lead student volunteer of this alumni meet. He was an NSS volunteer and we often shared our dreams, visions. A small contribution from our alumni or CSR money of corporate sector can contribute in a big way in relative terms. Having educated by Asha, I myself wonder why I am not contributing Rs. 15,000 a year to have roof for one family in our neighbourhood. Asha says that the whole house including mud walls, bamboo etc. costs Rs. 30,000. NSS, IIT Kharagpur works in 15 villages within 5-6 KM radius of our campus. There are about 15 primary school or sarva shiksha kendra (SSK). Fifteen water filter, each costing Rs. 2000 (approx.) amounts to Rs. 30,000 and can be a big differentiator. The other project could be painting / whitewashing these schools or developing infrastructures so that children feel like coming to school and reduce the drop out rate. We now have a very good rapport with local administration - from SDO, Panchayet Pradhan to village youth and the ground for taking up such activity is prepared!Panel Discussion I try to attend panel discussions held in the campus where there are guest speakers. This is to get idea and learn what others who care, are thinking. There were two panel discussions scheduled on 7th Jan. (SAT) afternoon as a part of alumni meet. I missed the first discussion on the 'Future of IIT' as I had to attend a parallel meeting that started at 3:30 PM and was on a dream project of IIT Kharagpur. The second topic of the panel discussion was little specific, on 'Safety in work place' - perhaps triggered by recent loss of lives due to fire at AMRI hospital. I was amazed to listen to the entire range of issues that are associated with safety and we, generally speaking, are so much ignorant of it. One speaker referred to one calculation which shows cost of life in India is only Rs. 12,000. No wonder, we can afford not to take note of it and consider expenditures related to safety is not value accretive! There is a need to educate ourselves and all of us need to work together to create awareness on this count."},
{"title": "Farewell 2011", "date": "Sunday, January 1, 2012", "text": "Good-bye 2011 ... Welcome 2012! Wish the new year ushers in happiness, peace and prosperity to one and all! My apology if I am not able to reach out individually to all with whom I enjoy a relationship laced with love, care and share.Earth's revolutionCrossing 40, one perhaps goes into down count mode. With 10-20 years remaining in which health might cooperate, we perhaps try to make every year count. We try to align ourselves more with things that are near and dear to us. We try to get a sense of satisfaction that the life has been a meaningful, worthy pursuit - the goal reached or not. Here comes the question. What has been the goal? Was there any goal for myself? Or was it always living a life on others' terms? Something like Brownian Motion, colliding with one thought now and next with another, leaving a zero net displacement at the end! As Earth completes one revolution around the Sun, it is time to take a look at what our thoughts and deeds revolved around in the year gone by. As it revolved in the orbit, spiraling up, our work may have yielded few milestones. Time to feel proud of it and look for more in the coming year. If something is missed due to slackness, time to take a resolve to remove them in the new year. The more important of course is to take note of what is there at the centre of our revolution, what is the fulcrum. Is it a desire to emerge as a better human being?Feeling Nostalgic Looking back at 2011, find a lot of room to improve in the coming year as far as slackness is concerned. I think that I can work even harder. Yes, there are too many responsibilities to give time to. Still, a better time and work management can bring out more. However, I am satisfied on one count. I have learnt to respect people more during the year, specially my young students. Be it my research students, or students in my UG classes, or N.S.S. students; I was simply humbled to see their character strength - the last semester specially was very enlightening. Thanks to all, my students. The strict, rigid personality you encountered day to day and tolerated :-) wants to thank all of you from the bottom of the heart for gifting a wonderful 2011, to which I feel like attached to. Attached is an image from our 25th Dec. Vizag tour. Gadadhar, not yet Sri Ramakrishna, the world renowned teacher who could not spell 'education' properly leaving native village for Dakshineshwar. (This exhibition is on Ramakrishna Beach of Vizag at the other side of the Beach Road. This is the best of such exhibitions I have seen so far.)One has to move on. Hope, the 2012 batch of students will be similarly generous, if not more.   Garbeta College VisitThe will and wish of many prevailed. The 5 day year end Vizag family tour followed high fever of daughter. There was an invitation to address N.S.S. volunteers of Garbeta College on 30th Dec. afternoon. My 9 year old daughter who usually prefers mother's company to enjoy her freedom to the fullest, wants me always to be with her when ill. The organizer's thankfully swapped two afternoon programs and mine was rescheduled on 31st Dec., the farewell day of 2011. By that time, the fever came down. We four (myself, Rajat - faculty of IIT Kharagpur and NSS program officer, Sahidullah - senior PhD student and Mr. Prabodh Kumar Sasmal - President, Kharagpur Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal) set off at 11:15 A.M.  We reached Garbeta college, 65 KM from our campus at about 1:15 PM. We stayed there till 4 PM.N.S.S. Special Camp at Garbeta CollegeDr. Sushil Ghosh, PhD from IIT Kharagpur and now a faculty member at Garbeta College, looking after NSS activities there organized the special 7 day long training camp. About 120 students participated. The pre-lunch session used to be physical work. The post lunch session was on various trainings (e.g. first aid, fire) and talks from invited speakers. On the 2nd day of the camp, Swami Sunishthananda, Principal, Midnapore Ramakrishna Mission School had an inspiring discourse. I heard Swamiji before addressing young audience. One has to listen spell bound when he talks. In my one hour address, I stressed on (i) challenges of modern society (ii) what is social service - self awareness before making others aware (iii) internal and external discipline (iv) self-confidence and believe in the power of the good (v) need to reach career milestones, not for flaunting ego but to be able to serve more (vi) importance of balanced development of Heart (to feel), Head (to think a solution) and Hand (to implement, not outsourcing all the time) (vii) the power of organization (viii) establishing network among NSS units - shared email address with all and requested to follow up. Rajat shared his unit's experience at NSS, IIT Kharagpur with campers. This followed an half-an-hour Q & A session. Finally, it  was time to end the session. We are not too much used to college students touching feet at IIT environment. But this is a common practice in a small town college of 3700 students but with broadband connection, catering to many, many villages in the neighbourhood. As is said, our nation lives in the villages. I was embarrassed a lot when students started asking for autographs. We paid a short 10 minute visit to a place called Gangani in our return trip. This was one KM from Garbeta college and had a beautiful landscape.V.S.R.C. Hall DayThis too was scheduled on 31st Dec. evening. VSRC houses project students with separate blocks for boys, girls and married couples. The project students of our lab. invited our family in this evening celebration. We discussed at home. Though the daughter is on recovery mode, it appeared that it would be ambitious to attend it. Hence we decided to give it a miss.Having returned from Garbeta College at 6:30 PM, I was preparing a project proposal to mail to sponsor and the phone of one project student from VSRC came. \"Sir, the program has started. We are waiting for you.\" There was a need to procure something from the market and I made a detour to VSRC to spend half-an-hour with the students. The cultural program was on. Since I had limited time, visited rooms of our lab. students on their invitation, had sweets and photographs there. They are kind enough not to force me for the dinner. The new block of VSRC meant for girls looked contemporary and beautiful. The old ones for boys looked depressing, perhaps needs a fresh coat of whitewash. The girls of course argued that they take more care of their apartments so that they look good. Among the boys, Isr... beat everybody by several notch in maintaining the room. Among the girls, the ones of Resh... and Debapr... were very nicely arranged. Neer.. disappointed me in the sense that his room had pic.s of only Lord Shiva and Swami Vivekananda :-) He is a regular in Wednesday Bhagavad-Gita class here and I was expecting more such pics there. In comparison, Resh.. had a greater much greater company of gods and goddesses in her room!!! Wished everyone Happy New Year in advance and left VSRC at 8:30 PM.Gods and GoddessesI leave it entirely to personal choice whether one believes in gods and goddesses. To me what Vivekananda said, \"Be good and do good. That is the whole of religion.\" or \"Religion is the manifestation of divinity already in a person.\" are sufficient. If worship of one form or the other or no form at all, helps one to have meditative mind, do self-analysis and strike a balance in life and not becoming superstitious or fanatic, it can be considered as a great device. If there is a better device, let one go for that. Few weeks back was traveling by car with Akash on steering wheel. Akash, a young boy, works in a car rental agency and we got his service on several occasions before. That day my mother was there in the car. She noticed that there were pictures of Goddess Kali of Dakshineshwar, Sri Ramakrishna, Ma Sarada in the car. Also, Akash stopped the car at one small road side temple, bowed and threw a coin. To this Akash said, \"I never looked at images of Gods and Goddesses or cared about them at younger age. My father used to say that a day might come when I would bow to even road side stones. Now into the profession of car driving, those words have come true.\" Our faith in gods and goddesses, unless originated from family values or deeper discourses, is proportional to uncertainty faced in life. A regular salaried employee with a guaranteed monthly income, in general, starts the daily chore much differently from a shop-keeper as far as their engagements with gods and goddesses are concerned. Even an otherwise non-believer turns believer when in duress. Does it help? The prayer may help in generating more energy, strength, wisdom which is already in us, not coming from outside. It may help to focus, concentrate. Our mind has great power. Our senses which are oriented outwards, defocusses it and we do not usually feel the power within.No SmokingSuraj was the driver in last Kolkata visit. This was the 2nd time I traveled with him. He had to abandon study at Class VIII due to sudden demise of father and started career as a helper of a truck. He takes all care for his sister who is on the verge of completing college education. Suraj wants to study further. Reading is no problem for him but he finds it difficult to write. We discussed if he can use waiting hours at parking to practise writing. That day, he had to park the vehicle at Sector-V, IT hub for some time. I had a discussion for an upcoming research lab. at IIT Khaargpur to be sponsored by the one of the largest Indian MNC in IT sector. In return journey, we stopped at Sher-i-Punjab at Kolaghat for tea. I asked Suraj how he liked Sector-V as it was his first visit. That place is giving employment to lakhs of people and looks so vibrant! Suraj gave an unapproving look at me and said, \"What you say is fine but girls working there smoke.\" I said that there might have been stress in the office work and may be smoking gives some relief. As such everyone now is trying to quit smoking due health concern. Suraj did not look convinced. He said, \"The girls were coming in large groups to that shop, close to where I parked the vehicle. Not one or two, all of them were smoking and they did not look stressed. Can so many of them be stressed simultaneously?\"It perhaps was not just a social taboo or gender / class discrimination or cultural shock he was referring to. Perhaps the brother in Suraj was worried about the future of his college going sister aspiring for a job.New Year ResolutionLet us try sincerely in this new year to come out of the habits that weaken us as an individual or as a nation and embrace the habits that make us strong.Vizag TourMy daughter (Brishti) had only 6 day long Christmas leave. We left Kharagpur on 22nd Dec. evening. The 5 day tour was all fun. The scenic beauty is unparallel - the hills merging themselves into the sea, the likes of 'Dolphin Nose'. Brishti spent everyday no less than half-an hour in the sea. Even on 27th evening, before we were set to depart. And it was no surprise that fever came few hours before we were set to board train. That apart every single thing was enjoyable. The hill top film studio, Kailash Giri amusement park, the zoo, submarine, museum - besides the various beaches. I scored a numero uno in some funky sense. Never ever got into sea anytime during the tour, not even the toes got wet! Much did my daughter and her excellency (6th pic from bottom, right side of the frame at Titanic Point of Kaliash Giri)) tried, always found a way out! Two of my pics at film studio is also there - one in OC's chair of the filmy police station (not related to texts where they appear)!!!Professional LifeThis is life as usual like any IIT faculty member. Interacting with students, technical staffs, colleagues, sponsors, collaborators. Trying to reduce no. of sponsored projects to remain focussed. Have had enough to develop a very, very decent lab. infrastructure. Just trying to get funds for existing students and being choosy about new projects. Not renewing projects with two sponsors who supported us for long. Our sincere thanks to them. Shall remain available to them whenever there is any specific need from their side. Shall work with a new sponsor (one Govt. research lab. delivering technology to field) who finds a very good match with our technology portfolio. Shall continue with a physcian sponsored project due to its special nature even if the project value is not high and there is manpower constraint. Seldom we find such a commitment from an individual, a medical expert. Two more interdisciplinary (inter- Dept. projects), One-Two new industry funded collaborative projects - and my hands are full. Cannot take any more. Moreover, would like to finish the book project asap. This is a commitment for long. Admin. responsibility is increasing and cannot help there too. This is what is lined up in 2012, as far as I can see.  I must say one thing here. The industries with whom we interacted and FICCI have been quite appreciative of our work. This inspires us a lot. On 21st Dec., there was a video shoot in our lab. by media people for an upcoming documentary. There was a dfference this time. In several places, I had to walk from a distance towards the camera. It was difficult for me to give a serious look at my face and there had to be few retakes."},
{"title": "India vs. Bharat", "date": "Tuesday, December 6, 2011", "text": "Observations to come later ... occupied with grade preparation ... DND notice pasted all over ...Times of India reports on 07.12.2011TIME TO THINK Income inequality doubles in India in 20 yrs TIMES INSIGHT GROUP New  Delhi: Inequality in earnings has doubled in India over the last two  decades, making it the worst performer on this count of all emerging  economies. The top 10% of wage earners now make 12 times more than the  bottom 10%, up from a ratio of six in the 1990s.     Moreover, wages  are not smoothly spread out even through the middle of the  distribution. The top 10% of earners make almost five times more than  the median 10%, but this median 10% makes just 0.4 times more than the  bottom 10%.     “The  main driver has been an increase in wage inequality between regular  wage earners ie contractual employees hired over a period of time,” says  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a  new report on inequality in the developed world and emerging economies.  “By contrast, inequality in the casual wage sector — workers employed on  a day-today basis — has remained more stable,” the report says.     South Africa is the only emerging economy with worse  earnings inequality, but it has halved this number since the last  decade. “The combination of marked spatial divides, persistently high  shares of informal sector jobs and disparities in access to education  accounts for much of the widespread variation in earnings from work in  the EEs,” the report says.     Wage inequality has driven more general income inequality in the country. India  has got more unequal over the last two decades — India’s Gini  coefficient, the official measure of income inequality, has gone from  0.32 to 0.38, with 0 being the ideal score. In the early 1990s, income  inequality in India was close to that of developed countries; however  its performance on inequality has diverged greatly since then, bringing  it closer to China on inequality than the developed world.     There  is evidence of growing concentration of wealth among the elite. The  consumption of the top 20% of households grew at almost 3% per year in  the 2000s as compared to 2% in the 1990s, while the growth in consumption of the bottom 20% of households remained unchanged at 1% per year.     In  comparison, the income of the bottom 20% of households in China grew at  double the rate in the 2000s as compared to the 1990s, while the  increase for the top 20% of households was much slower. In Brazil,  household incomes have been growing faster among the poorest households  than among the richest for the last two decades.     Of all the  emerging economies, India has by far the highest proportion of informal  employment, by any national or international measure. “In India…  informal employment includes a disproportionate number of women,  homebased workers, street sellers and workers subcontracted by firms in the formal sector,” the OECD report says.     India  spends less than 5% of its GDP on social protection schemes as compared  to Brazil’s more than 15%. Its tax revenue as a proportion of GDP is  under 20% — the lowest of all emerging economies, and just half that of  developed countries."},
{"title": "Yours sincerely", "date": "Wednesday, November 23, 2011", "text": "Dear student,Welcome to our research group. Hope, this association will be mutually beneficial. You will learn from the group. We shall also learn from you. The beginning of a research career starts with placing right questions that comes from a probing mind. In the initial phase, you will mostly contribute to the group by asking questions, looking beyond obvious - mostly 'why's and 'why not's. There is no question that can be called 'silly'. An inquisitive mind filled with innocence looks at the world with bewilderment, like a child - amused, excited, - a child having untiring zeal, indomitable spirit to ask endless questions. In the pursuit of knowledge which is infinite, we all are like a child and should possess such a quality. You will learn from the group, skill set we have already acquired. But you have to make it your own by not taking them as blackbox and asking relevant questions.I was waiting for this day for your induction to the team. There could have been a better start had you performed better in the test. It is not easy for somebody to come back to academics after so many years and getting only few weeks to prepare with a completely different type of project responsibility to attend to in parallel. You had been brave to appear for the test with such a short preparation. Have faith in yourself. Your P.I. (who talked to me earlier) is very much satisfied with your contribution to the project. Feel proud of what you achieved in such a short stay at IIT Kharagpur. You will definitely earn what you deserve. As far as reaching life's milestones, my little experience is that life gives opportunity. Our job is to remain prepared and make the most of opportunities when it come. The preparation is in our hand. It is not always possible to create opportunities ourselves. We are entitled to feel bad if we do not exert ourselves enough in the preparatory phase and let go an opportunity. You have worked hard since you joined and your responsibility ends there. There is no reason to feel bad. Take the feedback from the test - written and interview in right spirit and work on it. It is important to maintain a positive attitude and prepare oneself for the next opportunity. It will come.Be strong. Vivekananda says, \"Strength is life, weakness is death.\" \"Life is short. The vanities of the world are transient. They only live who live for others. The rest are more dead than alive.\" The milestones achieved in life are not for self or are vanity stuffs to flaunt about. It is owning up of more responsibility, telling people that I am to deliver more (not from a point of ego, true education never does that), they should expect more responsibility to be shouldered by me, they should make me aware if I am failing in my duty vis-a-vis capacity I possess. Reaching milestones are important as that gives us more capacity to serve. Let us hope and pray that each of us can raise ourselves to achieve more not just for self but for the society at large which in a nation like us constitutes of millions of underprivileged.Let us find sometime tomorrow and discuss how you may chart next part of the journey. Allow me to end this longish welcome message with one of my favourite Lord Buddha quote, \"Let us rise up and be thankful, for if we didn't learn a lot today, at least we learned a little, and if we didn't learn a little, at least we didn't get sick, and if we got sick, at least we didn't die; so, let us all be thankful.\" We all know that \"Lives of great men all remind us that we can make our lives sublime.\" I may suggest at least 5-10 minutes of study of lives of great men and women in everyday's routine. My own experience is that I have found Vivekananda quotes from \"Call to the Nation\" (Link) or his letters to young disciples like Alasinga (One Link), Nivedita (One link) very inspiring. Welcome again and cheers!Yours sincerely,  GSP.S. The older one grows, the more one starts giving sermons!!! And I am not getting younger day by day. Pls. get used to that as you join this group :-)"},
{"title": "Happy Diwali", "date": "Thursday, October 27, 2011", "text": "Happy Diwali to all! Wish I could send individual mails or cards to all I know, that includes who remembered and sent greetings cards but left no email id / phone no./full address. Perhaps, a post on this blog is the only way to reach out to all and say, \"Thanks\".Diwali in IIT Kharagpur is unmatched with its Illumination and Rangoli. I find that this post (Link) from a student captures it beautifully. It was wonderful to meet faculty colleagues and students yesterday evening while moving from one pandal to another with family and exchange greetings on the way. I must say that the IIT campuses are unparalleled and IIT Kharagpur campus is perhaps the best on human quotient.SilencedThree months back, there was a conversation with a mother (stationed abroad on an assignment) on google, me not knowing the tragedy that occurred recently. She was referring to the Arthur Ashe quote in the section 'A friend in need' of a previous post (Link) in the chat. Suddenly I realized that the 10 year old son was no more. The physicians tried their best but it was one of those rare diseases. Tears knew no bound when the mother said that she wished but could not be my student and wanted to bring the son to me someday. Wish I can rise to the expectation of parents / guardians / students and be worthy enough to be called a teacher. Let me share the talk (Link) that comes to my mind whenever such a discourse arises. The link may not open in some browsers.Steve Jobs Quote “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the  most important tool I’ve  ever encountered to help me make the big  choices in life. Because almost  everything — all external expectations,  all pride, all fear of  embarrassment or failure — these things just  fall away in the face of  death, leaving only what is truly important.  Remembering that you are  going to die is the best way I know to avoid  the trap of thinking you  have something to lose.“When I was 17, I read a quote that  went  something like: “If you live  each day as if it was your last,  someday  you’ll most certainly be  right.” It made an impression on me,  and since  then, for the past 33  years, I have looked in the mirror  every morning  and asked myself: “If  today were the last day of my  life, would I want  to do what I am about  to do today?” And whenever  the answer has been  “No” for too many days in  a row, I know I need to  change something.\"Digging DeepWhat we see in the surface is not what one is but what one wants to show. \"If hard work is what pays then the donkey would have been the king of a forest and not lion.\" I placed the quote before a class of 100 students. The class said that they do not agree with it. I told, \"I am not asking if you agree or not. What do you think of the person who writes this in his public portrayal?\" May appear that he is in control of himself, very strong and knows what he is doing. An expert in psychology may say. With 284 facebook friend, his other public note was, \"hell is d new hanging adda, when nobody is wid me.\" Wonder any of his friend could see it and make out what he has in his mind. An IIT final year with no backlog, no apparent reason to develop such a distaste of life at this age! And IIT Kharagpur was again news for a student who bade adieu to life.  Requested all to share with us (teachers, elders) issues they face. May be the experience of the struggle each of us go through help one another. My experience can be found in a previous post (Link). What does great teachers like Vivekananda say? He asks the youth to be strong and exhorts (Link1, Link2, Link3) in his call to the nation \"Go from village to village, do good  to humanity and to the world at large. . …… ‘When death is certain, it is better to die for  a good cause.’\"Student Welfare GroupJumped on a Student Welfare Group, IIT Kharagpur under Dean, SA website (Link) which is recently launched. Had a conversation with one of the content developer who worked in NSS last year. He was one of the lead volunteer and thus we got acquainted. A very good effort from IIT Kharagpur students. I also liked the shoutbox of scholars avenue blog (Link).  Let all stake holders of IIT system come and work together to see that every flower blooms.And there was lightIt was wonderful to read in the newspaper that students of one High School did not buy new dress materials in this Durga Puja and urged their parents to donate the money for costly treatment of a needy classmate. The other day television news showed friends coming together to make a pandal which looks like 'Academy of Fine Arts' of Kolkata. There the paintings of one club member who is a rickshaw puller by profession and painter by passion are displayed. The rickshaw puller painter does not have money to exhibit his work in Academy of Fine Arts at Kolkata. The friends decided to create one for him in the locality.Real vs. virtual friend  I often worry about the abundance of virtual friends in recent times. These days we prefer to converse on chat with my next door neighbour than taking a walk together. May be the virtual platform helps the shy to unshackle themselves in the beginning. But a real friend is the one which never goes off-line.  I remember the Chanakya Shloka we memorized in our Sanskrit class of Class VIII. \"Utsabe byasane chaiba durbhikkhe rashtrabiplabe / Rajadware, Shashmane Cha Jasthishthati Sa Bandhaba.\" A weak translation would be : He is a friend who is with you in fun, in famine, in revolution, in front of the king, in crematorium. It is not just fun which gets shared but more challenging situations such as those. The English adage says : A friend in need is a friend indeed. Let us hope to get one, let us be one."},
{"title": "Directors Speak", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2011", "text": "The Diamond Jubilee convocation function had a very interesting panel discussions on 22nd August, 2011 morning at Netaji Auditorium. We had former IIT Kharagpur Directors Padmashree Prof. K. L. Chopra and Prof. Amitabha Ghosh; current Directors of IIT Bhubaneshwar, IIT Ropar, IIT Indore and Prof. P. Chakraborty from IIT Kanpur. Prof. M. S. Swaminathan of TIME magazine fame, member of Planning Commission and National Advisory Council also graced the panel. What followed is a feast of thoughts, an introspection on 60 years of IIT system and the way ahead. I could not locate any report on this and hence presenting here what I could take as running notes.Prof. Chopra initiates the discussion by saying that we are supposed to be think-tanks. We may have been so for UG studies. But emphasis is too much on UG studies. Integrated M.Tech., PhD should be preferred. To shift from teaching based to learning based i.e. outcome based, learning how to learn. He emphasized on breaking barriers among Departments, reducing no. of credits to be cleared by students. He gave example of MIT where 130 credits are enough (compared to IIT's 175) and 30% of this is constituted by core subjects and students enjoy a lot of flexibility in selecting subjects. He expects new IITs to show new way and does not like the idea of being mentored by older IITs (as it hinders new thinking). He wishes to see DST change how it functions.Prof. Amitabha Ghosh was the next speaker. He stressed on importance of planning and preparing the country to be at centre stage of 3rd industrial revolution. He talked about revamping curriculum at least in a few IITs and opening the door of IITs to world students (at least MTech and PhD) on its way to become world institutes.Prof. M. K. Surappa, Director, IIT Ropar spoke next. He explained the challenges in setting up of  a new institute. He emphasized on quality focus. All IITs together have 6000 publications a year with citation index 5-6. MIT publishes 4000 a year but citation index is 20. He worried about languishing university system and if IITs can help them, NITs to get good students for research. He talked about creation of new knowledge that will be put in application over next 20 years; in areas like waste management, water, energy, healthcare etc.Prof. M. Chakraborty, Director, IIT Bhubaneshwar talked about issues faced by a head of a new IIT. He mentioned how his IIT is unique in offering interdisciplinary exposure to students, to strike  balance between domain knowledge and broad area. Every final year project must have supervisors from two different departments.Director, Indore explained the present infrastructure situation at his IIT and challenges faced. He told that it is easier for newer IITs to adopt a change. In his IIT, a student has to undergo six month's industry / shopfloor experience.Prof. Partha Chakraborty of IIT Kanpur said that IIT education should make one socially aware, become a good citizen, contribute to nation building - becoming broad based. Research environment should be there in the country. Many smaller universities feed Stanford. This should hold for IITs too.Prof. Swaminathan spoke last in the first round. He said that the 60 years of IIT was not only the time to celebrate but also to introspect where we had gone wrong. He talked about reducing food spoilage, environmental impact of new technology, helping nationwide poverty alleviation programs like MGNAREGA with technology. He said that it is better to look for individuals and build institutions around that individual.Then it was a kind of open house.Prof. Chopra observed how MIT focused on infrastructure in first 75 years, industry in second 75 years and planning (health, global) in third 75 years but there are no such things for IITs. More than the money, the power of mind holds key. How could C. V. Raman, S. N. Bose, Meghnad Saha perform with junk equipments!Prof. Ghosh narrated one anecdote where a young faculty wanted to leave IIT for a foreign university not for money or comfort, but for poor quality of research students he was getting. He said that even a mediocre US university get bright students from India, China. He wondered how US universities would perform if foreign students are not there. Prof. Chopra observed that the IIT students go out for money as well as lack of inspiration from IIT teacher. Prof. Ghosh said that the prestige in our country increases i one goes outside the country or publishes work in foreign journals.Prof. M. Chakraborty brought the topic of collaboration among faculty members. He said that the competitors can be collaborators and it is worthwhile to work in a group. There were a lot of questions from the audience. The discussion came to an abrupt end when the hard time cut-off was reached. But it was great experience to listen to these experienced people and get educated.Rejoinder:Prof. K. L. Chopra's interview as published in IIT Kharagpur's student mouth piece 'Scholars Avenue' (Link) leaves more food for thought. Excerpts from the interview as appeared in the link is pasted below.There are presently 3,500 private technical colleges and 350 private  universities to do the job of producing over 93% of the engineering  graduates in India. It is wiser then to concentrate on quality rather  than increase the number and intake of IITs which will not significantly  change the overall percentage of graduating engineering manpower for  the country. The magnified numbers today have become a burden on the  existing IITs. Just imagine herding 4 students in one room in the  hostel. As for educating a class full of two hundred students, even Feynman,  the great physicist, the great actor, declared his efforts at Caltech a  failure. “It is the inspiration from the teacher that makes you a  scientist or an engineer,” and this, KL Chopra says, cannot happen  unless there is an eye-to-eye contact and direct interaction between the  teacher and the student. The IITs were supposed to be the think-tanks  of the country, but he believes the kind of reforms being incorporated  is converting them to regular universities.“The vision of education in IITs was to create knowledge, which is  more important than dissemination. Also, the focus needs to be on  translational research,” says KL Chopra. It isn’t that people in the IIT  system aren’t competent, but there is nobody accounting for the  deliverance of knowledge in a country whose economy is heavily dependent  on science and technology. He believes this is a form of intellectual  corruption: a condition where no questions are asked. “Fortunately the  government did not know what was going on with the IT industry and thus  it flourished very well.”We learned that India is a signatory to the Washington Accord, a  document with benchmarks for education quality. The IITs come under its  purview and will have to be judged sometime, an evaluation KL Chopra  says they will not necessarily pass.  While IITans have hitherto enjoyed  global mobility, foreign organizations now realize that given the bulk  of students, a spectrum is bound to exist. While he believes a  transition to a system involving thorough evaluation is going to be  difficult for students as well as teachers, that is what the world today  demands. It is not what is taught that is important, but whether and  what students have learned, and whether they have learned to learn."},
{"title": "Listening To", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2011", "text": "This was 18th August, 2011 Foundation Day lecture at Netaji Auditorium by Mr. Sandipan Chakravortty, our alumnus and M.D. of a TATA enterprise. I tried with our alumni office who in turn made a contact with Mr. Chakravortty. But as it appeared this was an extempore and he did not carry any written material that can be mailed. Therefore, I present here what I could scribble in the invitation card that I carried to the auditorium.Mr. Chakravortty told the students, \"As IITians, first brand yourself as human being. Being IITians, you are different from others. You are inspirational leader with a backbone of integrity.\" He talked about wide spread corruption and felt proud when he said that there are \"no IITians in this space and IITians hold head high.\"He continued on what Industry wants from an young engineer, a being who is physically and mentally healthy; has good domain knowledge; good communication ability, believes in team work, integrity, by nature ambitious, dynamic, innovative. He observed that we grow up as individuals in school. However, the IIT life teaches team work.Next, he said, \"You must have spiritual feelings.\" By this he meant listening to the call of conscience. He differentiated 'good' and 'great' by this yard stick. Good people are efficient. Great people are efficient and listen to the call of conscience.He warned if 'lust of knowledge' is replaced by 'lust of money' among IIT students. He feels hurt when media highlights highest salary received by an IIT student from campus placement as a scoring point of one IIT over another. Finally, he said that TATA enterprises are highest tax payers and do not do accounting tricks to reduce tax burden. The guiding philosophy of J. R. D. Tata \"is not to look at profits but how much tax that has been paid. Paying tax is a matter of pride.\""},
{"title": "Life is precious!", "date": "Monday, July 25, 2011", "text": "Disclaimer : This post is in response to an unfortunate incident that occured last week or reported to happen at IIT Kanpur, IIT Madras in recent times . This is to share some of my life’s experience which may be found useful by some. The aim here is not to find fault with an individual, institution or a practice but to complement the efforts being made by the stake holders of the society. Section ILast week I got a ‘Like’ from a student on an inspiring quote of Goutam Buddha that I pasted on Google Buzz. Following back I found that the student’s own posts in the buzz are inspiration abound. There I found this youtube video. What I liked most in this is the ability to face the life by not feeling bitter about it in such a situation. The glow in face indicates a sense of fulfillment which most of us, blessed not being challenged like that, lack. Salute to the spirit of life!Happening on the Ground!Few days back, one student entered my office in the evening, thoroughly shaken. Hours back one final year student of a different Dept. but from same hostel, has taken the extreme step. Apparently, he was struggling to put up a good academic performance and he largely confined himself to his room. The remedial part needs timely assistance from fellow students, family members, faculty members, admin. etc. The institute has a counseling cell and every hostel has a student group to assist it. Since the results are computerized, an algorithm could be put in place to generate an alarm and forewarn all concerned if some sort of pattern is found in the progress report. The guardians can remote log in through their ward’s log-in, password into institute’s ERP system and track the performance. They may visit the institute at least once a semester to talk to faculty members and discuss the progress. Being Multidimensional However, it is wiser to be less dependent on environment or remedial measures. It is better to acquire important life skills oneself from early stages of life. The guardians should appreciate this and not engage their wards in career oriented study only. The playgrounds are empty these days as the students are running from one tution teacher to other, trying to make every single minute of the day count. For youngsters, there is no time to study biographies or teachings of great people and drawing inspiration from them as they are ‘out of syllabus’.  Reading novels or classics are replaced by watching television which does not allow imagination to grow. It is not only sublime thoughts, as a whole we are thinking a lot less these days or have less time for ourselves to think what, how and why? More PracticesFew days back I was insisting one of my relative to take at least one week break every year so that the family can spend quality time together in some travel destination. They cannot do that not to miss the private tution of their ward. I wonder if I can suggest participating in cultural functions in the school or locality – it could be a play or group dance, song or recitation. I would even suggest taking some time out on a weekly basis to do something for the underprivileged. It could be teaching Math. / English for one hour to the kid of the housemaid or spending some time in the nearby old age home or orphanage. The value of spending some time on a weekly basis (if not daily) in a good company or a study-circle is so much underrated! If I talk about few minutes of prayer and mental concentration on a daily basis, I am talking more about calming down of one’s nerves that can focus the energy better, than making one spiritually inclined.What we MissThe sportsman-spirit – the ability to accept victory or defeat gracefully, the ability to communicate with others or work in a team, the sense of responsibility to oneself or the family or the community are found wanting in the ‘me as centre’ way of life. We the elders are more responsible to allow such an attitude towards life as we never worried about what is healthy and what is unhealthy in trying to push a youngster towards some sort of competitive advantage in a career-only life. Are we these?We try to tell that if somebody does not get into IIT, he is a failure; if somebody does not have a 5 figure monthly income, he is unsuccessful; if somebody manages to skip Independence Day celebration at school and attends special class of the coaching centre at that time, he is clever; if somebody manages to hide tips received for study / exam. from fellow students, he is intelligent. We do not value patriotism, love, unselfishness, truthfulness, trustworthiness, honesty, …. in fact, we treat them as deterrent to make our ward ‘smart’ or ‘street ready’ …. the idea is to counter the ‘selfish world’ with greater amount of selfishness … in the process we run into a vicious cycle …. all the while we believe that I have equipped my ward enough to scrape through or outlive others. Alas! We are making hell out of this world what could have been a heaven.  It is all about striving!Nothing is automatic in life. We have to earn what we deserve. Else we have to leave our life to chances. Will a young individual prefer that or lead a life of one’s choice? Then please do not neglect development of different faculties of life. Develop yourself as a complete human being. Life is to be enjoyed. The less self-centred we are, the more we are able to enjoy ourselves. You don’t need to believe these words. Practise and experience yourself. The sign of life is ‘strength and happiness’. Mind the word ‘and’. It is not ‘or’. Both are required. Find a way that gives you both. May you all become inquisitive about life. It is precious! Section IISince 1986 (the year when I got decent ranks in 10+2 Board Exam., Medical Entrance Exam., Engineering Entrance (IIT-JEE and WB-JEE) Exam.), several students and their guardians approached me for discussions on how to excel in career oriented study and not life as such. I appreciate if they thought I am too inexperienced to comment on excellence in life. But that I do not see them as two different things and one is a part of the whole did not cut much ice. My father (Link) allowed me to attend only three felicitation functions. I got an opportunity to speak on two occasions – one at my school and the other at a district level function. The state level function was the one hosted by Chief Minister and was formal in nature. In both places, I talked a lot about what helped me in my preparation - sports and games, drawing inspiration from Vivekananda quotes, the positive impact of discussions conducted in weekly study circle etc. Perhaps I talked too much on this to make the organizers feel rattled in both the places.  Speaking from experience!I am sure that everybody understands the importance of hard and systematic work. I request you to have sufficient time for self-study to assimilate what gets into head. Running from one tution to another which does not give space for oneself, perhaps is not the best idea. At 10+2 level, I took two tutions. Each teacher taught twice a week for about 2.5 hours and thus only four slots per week were blocked. This (i) reduced the financial burden of my father (ii) allowed more time or self-study and (iii) allowed me to hit playground every afternoon. Please refer to the segment titled 'Lady with a lamp' in this post to appreciate the longing for study.  And now!Yesterday (Saturday is Extra Academic Acitivity day here as per institute curriculum) a group of NSS (National Service Scheme) volunteers asked me to attend a meet for a brief period. These are the famous Super-30 pass outs. They are motivated by their mentor there to do something for the needy. NSS gives them a platform. They have gathered some 15 students from two state Govt. run schools. They have an intensive training plan to work with Class XI-XII students on Saturday and Sundays. When I reached there, I found that the school students cannot come on Saturdays and there is only common slot available on Sunday. Each has already three or more private tutors. I asked the school students, with another training program like this, when will you have time to study yourself?  Beyond MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions)The intensive and exhaustive beat-the-MCQ-based-exam-pattern training of some coaching centres may allow some of you to crack the entrance exam. A good memory is a big plus point. But the life beyond is no more MCQ based. The solutions will not come from what you have memorized alone or the tricks that you have learnt that exploits the weaknesses of MCQ type evaluation. Life beyond will always test your fundamentals. You have to decide if you should enjoy the success of cracking a tough entrance exam., make merry for months or a year OR assess what you missed in your preparation and make up for that. The choice is yours! You have a right!Life is beautiful and exciting. Please feel curious about it. Never ever think about pushing yourself to an extreme. Read the biographies of great people. Develop interest in sports and games, community welfare initiatives. Give more time to next door and physical (not virtual) friends. Be in touch with family members. Talk or write blogs. Express yourself. Whenever you feel any need, ask for assistance. It is your right. The world belongs to you. You too belong to this world. Always give each other another chance. (I wanted to talk on a more serious issue related to a recent happening. A new post follows.)  Extended WeekWe hear about extended weekend. Last 14-15 days were like an extended week where I had to work without a break. I don’t remember having been exhausted so much in recent times. On two occasions, I had simultaneously three meetings to attend. The dignitaries from outside the institute, the chairman, the rest of the committee members were kind enough to accommodate my hopping around once I finished placing my observations in the meeting. Whether it is a discussion on Diamond Jubilee Celebration or setting up of a national test and research facility or registration of new students all considered my appearance and disappearance very sympathetically. Grateful to all! Welcome to new students!This week also saw infusion of two fresh bloods in our research team. After 3.5 years we got any institute scholar and this time two joined simultaneously. One is to work in speech and the other one biomedical signals, the twin pillar of our group. In between, students joined various sponsored projects and kept contributing to research. One QIP scholar, and three MS students also enrolled formally this semester though they were with us for a few months now. Anyways, it always is a pleasure to welcome new members in a family. My best wishes to all the new members. Environment and WeThe extended week brought a completely new experience. Our team of three faculty members and three technicians moved around Kolkata for two days and collected some field data. This was on the request of Dr. Sudarshan Ghosh Dastidar, Minister-in-Charge, Environment, Govt. of West Bengal. It was very inspiring to see the minister joining us in one field data collection. Then he took us to his office. He has far reaching research theme in his mind to correlate environment and civilization by a statistical model and thereby predict disaster. I was thinking if it would help in tweaking some of the primary variables and prevent a disaster or if the worst happens, remaining prepared for it. My IIT colleagues told MIC that it would excite me as I work on modelling. I listened while taking a print out of a recent WHO (World Health Organization) report. Missed StudentsI worked in industry before. There I worked on shop-floors for more than two years. But this field data collection from Kolkata para -s was an experience of different kind. Interacted with a lot of common people. We were surprised to see the awareness level. In one small Govt. school, we never realized till we were on the verge of leaving the school, that we had been interacting with an Academy Award winning writer. So humble he is and so concerned about the well-being of his students! Be it a young girl studying law or panicky elders, all had a great respect of IIT and I always wished if we could include some of our IIT students too in our team. The Grand MeetingThe breakfast meeting at Oberoi Grand, Kolkata was scheduled for one hour duration. The Senior Pro from US has just arrived. Their Indian Officials were also there. I have worked with the Indian team on several projects since 2003. I worked with the US team briefly for about 2 years. Except this 2011 summer vacation, I was always engaged with them. We had a lot of things to talk and we did not realize how THREE hours passed. They invited us to take a new US project which is free from encumbrance, addressed as ‘partner’ and I happily agreed. It is a very big challenge though, a good two year long project but I am confident and as always I seek good wishes of all and blessings of elders. Lady with the LampI was totally drained yesterday (Saturday) evening after finishing all the tasks in hand. I decided to retire for some time and randomly picked up a novel of Shekhar Mukhopadhyaya from a 2010 festival collection. I must say that it could not have been a better choice at that time and went to sleep only after finishing the same. The story started with corporate war and corporate ethics (or lack of it). Enters a very strong, compassionate character as company secretary and there on the story drifts with her. She does her part to inspire others and brings an human element in the approach of those who matter. Finally, she decides to abandon the corporate job and proceed for research and a Ph.D. at the pinnacle of her corporate career. But why? What is wrong there? The near and dear ones ask. Comes the calm but resolute voice, “I miss my silent hours with books.”"},
{"title": "Prof. G. S. Sanyal Passes Away", "date": "Saturday, July 9, 2011", "text": "If you try to find biography of a person in any search engine and come across hundreds of other biographies that bears his name, you are looking for a person who has grown beyond himself. Such a person can never pass away and that proves how inaccurate the title of this post is. The DNA is carried by thousands of people and it is only the mortal frame that bade adieu.It was 7th July, 2011 afternoon. The NSS Advisory Committee Meeting was just concluded. I was leaving Board Room after some last minute discussion with Program Adviser of NSS Regional HQ. \"Prof. Sanyal is no more\", said the Director. We rushed to Prof. Sanyal's quarter. It was at about 5 P.M. Gradually, faculty members, staffs - the IIT community started pouring in. We started informing outstation faculty members. They started calling back to know when the last rites would be performed and how they can be at Kharagpur at that time.The last time I heard Prof. Sanyal speaking and speaking emphatically was 14th June, 2011. It was Research Scholars' Day at GS Sanyal School of Telecommunication. I have added pic of that here (Top two). He discussed fundamentals of communication for about 10 minutes at a stretch. You can see the rapt attention and reverence in the audience that includes Deputy Director, Dean of Post Graduate Studies, Chairman of the School, Faculty Members. It wasn't only for young research scholars, it was an educative experience of all present. I wish, I had recorded it. He was Director when I joined as a B.Tech. student here in 1986. I had few interactions with him in recent times where he talked about his one dream project. He wanted to capture electromagnetic radiation coming out of human body and use it for diagnostic purpose. I said that it would be great to participate and take care of the signal processing and pattern recognition part of the proposed diagnostic tool. I understand that he regularly sat across the table with faculty members from electromagnetic / microwave background to gather a signal of decent signal-to-noise ratio. He interacted with one of them on this the previous Friday i.e. the 1st July, 2011.I have added one pic (the 3rd one) of Prof. GS Sanyal from ICCCD-2010 (he is the 2nd person in front row). This was taken on 10th Dec., 2010 while Ex-President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was addressing the audience. The last pic was taken yesterday when his mortal frame visited the Dept. for the last time.Request readers to visit these links (Link1, Link2, Link3, Link4) to know more about the man and the legacy he has left behind. (Pls. click at various links at bottom of the webpage of Link2)The Rainbow Week referred here lost its most vibrant colour that reverberates across the length and breadth of the IIT Kharagpur community. There is a follow-up and a new post on that. That is an Experience with big 'E' and is not mixed with several experiences of small 'e's as mentioned next. Big Relief       I felt like appearing in end-sem. exam. once again. Last year we started afresh. Advisory Committee Meeting was held in August, 2010 after a long, long time. We had a job at hand. To awaken us from a deep slumber. Only a few of us had some experience to work at field level. We stuck to the task. Tried our best. Not that 100 percent of the people came forward or gave 100 percent of them. But definitely some gave more than 100 percent. About 900 Students, 14 faculty members worked hard through out the year. This was NSS, IIT Kharagpur Advisory Committee Meeting held on 7th July, 2011. Besides Director, Dean there was S.D.O., Kharagpur, Program Adviser from Regional Head Quarter, Kolkata, representatives of Nehru Yuva Kendra (NYC) and several NGOs. I was tensed. Had I worked enough to present properly the wide spectrum of activities undertaken and not to fail the team as a whole? The other responsibility was to raise the issues faced by the volunteers when they go to villages, to discuss solution to problems that requires help from Administration.That the work of NSS, IIT Khragpur was highly appreciated is an under statement. Program Adviser told that other NSS units looks at what we are doing and try to emulate. Ministry Officials in Delhi refer our work. He wanted the slides I presented on our year long work to show to others.And it was a big relief! I knew that the preparation had been good, hard work pays but an exam. is an exam. That evening I slept from 8:30 PM. In between, woke up to have dinner and post the message to all NSS volunteers and Program Officers.We got valuable suggestion from all members including student representatives who are part of the Advisory Committee. Observation of one student representative can be found here. The Dean we report to for NSS lovingly said this morning in vegetable market, “Give some time to family too. Else you will be in trouble.” The support of my family had always been and will be my strength.Work of our Lab. getting noticedI visited a Bangalore based big research lab. the previous week on invitation. Stayed in their Guest House. The hospitality was great. We were discussing collaboration on one research problem. Their scientists had paid a visit at our IIT Kharagpur lab. on that earlier. After I completed my presentation, the group requested us to collaborate on three research problems with much larger budget towards a much longer term relationship. I am happy to say I could finish writing 3 proposals this week and send it to them on 6th July. Let’s see how it unfolds. Received two interesting proposals from two working professionals having M.Tech. degree. They want to work for Ph.D. in our lab. even without any funding. They have saved something from their salary and keen to pursue this. For one, noted academician and previous V.C. of BPUT recommended our lab. She came all the way from Bhubaneshwar and I told her how to prepare for the Ph.D. admission test scheduled in Dec. I discussed alternatives like doing it while in job from Bhubaneshwar itself where our ex PhD students are working as faculty member. The other candidate is from Kharagpur itself. I requested him to meet me when he visits KGP next time.This morning the Head of law school told me happily that funding for the big project has arrived. It is a law school initiative on IP generation and protection. I accompanied him to Delhi and successfully defended the project there. The IP generated in our lab., the various interactions we have with industry, FICCI will come as case study. Erstwhile a practicing lawyer, the Head is very friendly and we have to work out the implementation schedule that includes recruitment of staff next working day.Curiosity Kills a CatEarlier I wrote on cell phone health hazard in this blog (link). Recently World Health Organization (WHO) officially accepted and warned. The CNN report (can be found here) quotes, \"What microwave radiation does in most simplistic terms is similar to what happens to food in microwaves, essentially cooking the brain. So in addition to leading to a development of cancer and tumors, there could be a whole host of other effects like cognitive memory function, since the memory temporal lobes are where we hold our cell phones.” It is a bg ‘No-No’ for children whose skull is thin. Though I do not work in the area of microwave or microwave radiation, I was approached by the team Govt. of West Bengal constituted on this. I recommended and an expert from our Dept. will be doing the study. I did not find much of a logic for me to be there but they insisted. I have a curiosity to know how Govt. works for public good. What are the different blocks in that block diagram and what kind of latency, throughput exist. Can we find an innovative way to accelerate the process? This is one area where public is exposed to hazard for abundant use of technology. To me, it should be a mix of regulation and public awareness (NSS can conduct a campaign!). I must say that I am no expert in any of this. I was told that I am there because our one interest is in Biomedical area and we carry an air of positivity with us!!! Anyways, I am approaching it as a student. One more responsibility but I would always welcome the ones that can bring relief to silent millions.When Bulge is BeautifulA lot of well-wishers often show their concern for my health and that includes my Ph.D. supervisor who is now fully settled in US. Senior teachers who have seen me here in my B.Tech. and Ph.D days are more complaining about the weight I have gained. I try to reason myself this way. A dancer, if leaves dancing, gains weight. No surprise that a footballer who never missed hitting football ground, whether there is sun or rain, would gain weight. However, I am well aware that I am not doing enough. Let me see how to address this.But every coin has two sides. The bulge can be useful too. I am not talking about what Vivekananda termed as ‘famine insurance fund’. I fell from the horse in a rough terrain at Pahalgam in our recent Kashmir visit. Nothing happened. Today, I met a small accident with my 2-wheeler while negotiating a low lying branch of a tree in front of the Dept. A lot of my colleagues were there. That nothing happened has got something to do with the cushion my bones are enjoying. Both the occasions had enough in it to remain bed-ridden for weeks at the least!Not to OverlookOne of my colleagues asked me to be careful because it is happening too frequently. In fact, last Friday while bringing my mother from Railway station it was the seat-strap of the mother that saved her. The advanced age and rheumatic pain do not allow mother to take a long walk. We have a foldable wheel-chair for that purpose. She was returning from my sister’s place and I picked her up in the KGP railway station. At one place, the front wheel got stuck in small hole on the road and the momentum of the wheel-chair almost made it over-turn. Thankfully, mother was strapped to the chair and regained her balance well.I noticed something interesting while waiting in the railway platform. The railway porters were playing Ludo when there was no train. Earlier I saw them playing cards or simply gossip. In the attached picture the Ludo board can be seen on the tree as the train had just arrived. This morning I assured all my colleagues that everything is fine with me after that small accident. There was a small assembly for which all met. When everybody dispersed I moved towards my 2-wheeler to head towards home. I found that one of my colleagues waited and waited, apparently busy with cell phone messaging, but moved only when I successfully started and maneuvered the vehicle. I guess that he did not want to show-of but wanted to make himself available had I needed any assistance. Touched and feel proud to have such colleagues.if – then - else[I was thinking if this is to be put in the post. If I do not, people here who know about it and follow my blog may wonder how such an important development got missed. Perhaps the Prof. has something to hide. Further, there are important messages for all in the episode. Respecting privacy of an individual I am avoiding names and even any prefix or suffix. Those who can identify are the persons who have received all the copies of the mail or have already heard about it and there is no news value for them. Others cannot identify and for them only the experience I want to share is important. Also this may put rest to speculation, if any, in student circle and encourage better communication between faculty and student.] There was a mail from a project student last Sunday who I met even 2 days before (Friday) in the lab. He spent little over 1 year 10 months here. In the mail, he spelt out some very important dates with hard cut-off like departure from the country for an integrated Ph.D program abroad, a major family function involving him in between and all of them with hardly 8-10 working days from the date of his mail and his departure. Had he discussed these dates with me well ahead (at least the departure date) something, as close as possible as he wanted further in the mail, could have been tried. At least his registration seminar could have been arranged without any difficulty. I was only waiting for one of his senior who too is in the queue to get ready and to have them in a single day. As such the faculty members were gathered thrice during vacation in recent times for three presentations from our lab. students. I told him the same. Even then he did not share the date or disclose that there is such an urgency. In his T-th dated mail, I was awe-struck to see him spelling out all the dates by himself what I and PG Committee should do on T+n th dates, without considering my availability, availability of Dept. PG committee during vacation and conformity to institute rules. He asks me to arrange Reg. Seminar on T+2th date (mind that T is Sunday), Synopsis Seminar on T+10th date and says that his thesis writing would be over by that time (he never discussed any work beyond the one that would go in Reg. Seminar and I wonder how his thesis got ready!), departure from country on T+14th date and a very important family event on T+6th date. There was never any mention of how he would hand over the charge of his part of the project to other staffs. He says that he needs only one working day to finish his part of the job and it is not easy for others to do what he has developed in last 1.5 years of the project. He will do all those things related to charge handover only if I act as per his instruction. Each time I tried to explain what should be his priority for a lawful separation and how his fellow project student will feel the extra burden to complete the project, he returned it with more personal insults to me. Then I requested people from the lab. close to him to talk to him and make him understand. It did not work. I had no other option but to inform institute authority. They wanted me to act immediately (Monday evening) and not wait till next day. Still, I tried to reach out to him through his friends. It failed again. Now, the entire matter is with the institute and I have acted, am acting as asked by the institute authority. His latest reply expanded the scope, bringing allegation against faculty members of other Dept.s, Deans and he has copied that to funding agency.   [If any of his well-wisher (preferably elderly people who he respects) is reading this part of the post may consider suggesting him to hand over the charge and send a simple apology mail to institute authority before he leaves the country (pls. try only if such a suggestion does not make him feel worse). I understand that he is angry primarily with me. Let him take as much time as required to manage that anger and hope someday, this ‘angry-young-man’ of mid-twenty, can see what he cannot see now.]Why this happened?I was wondering how it could happen. Our lab. is known for its discipline, sincerity, dedication. Some do better than others based on their background and approach to a solution but devotion to research or lab. are never doubted (except for one single case that happened 3 years back but that got sorted out when the student reworked the formulation). Our students are respected even by faculty members who speak highly of their work. The sponsoring Head of a funding agency wants to telephone our students directly seeking their involvement in a new project or take them to meet very high officials in Delhi who would explain them how important the project is for the nation etc.I got a clue from one senior student of the lab. who is now faculty member of an engineering college. He says, “Just by spending time in labs or by doing daily passengering we can't understand the spirit of IIT; we need to spend the holidays there and explore all the facilities it provides.” Then I got to know that this young man lied to me all the way from 3 months of his joining. It was not only weekends but he always stayed outside campus (about 60 KM distance).  He used to express his displeasure and avoid the issue if I inquired at any point of time. There may be something more than this but that is outside the scope of this blog. The aim here is to tell the youth the life's different challenges, the rainbow experience we go through. It might leave some clue how to equip oneself to face the life fair and square. Besides academic qualification one needs to learn life-skills that does not necessarily come from any career oriented book. One needs to find time to expose oneself and get educated. Trust DeficitOne senior Prof. used to tell me time and again, “Be careful in recruitment. It takes only one person to spoil a lab.” Now as soon as the project fund arrives, the clock starts ticking. You have deliverables defined for every quarter. Often, the project staff leaves in between if another opportunity is available. Therefore, we often recruit whoever is knocking. We usually give reco. to our students joining different place. Probably, we should now ask reco. and talk to referees before recruiting anyone.We are now conducting a restructuring in the lab. keeping in mind the senior pro’s advice. We have got another space in a different building. Making use of that. Asking people to get on with life and deliver the best. No point brooding over the past. As Vivekananda says, “Spit out your action, good or bad and be azad (free).” One should not be disturbed by criticism. If the criticism is correct, one should accept it and take corrective action. If the criticism is wrong, why bother and give it undue importance?The other thing that I remember (to put the past behind us) is from the life of Swami Brahmananda (Raja Maharaj) of Ramakrishna order. Once there was a turmoil in a centre. Everybody was fighting with every other person. Raja Maharaj came to solve the problem. As soon as he arrived, all gathered and started complaining against one another. To this, Raja Maharaj said that he would listen to all of them but after 7 days. He spent these 7 days in that centre. Everybody woke up early and joined him in the meditation in the prayer hall, underwent discourses, so on and so forth – followed a daily routine which ideally should be followed in a Ramakrishna Mission centre. After 7 days, he called all of them and asked to specify problems. And behold! None had any problem, any complain.Let us follow in our daily routine the ideal life of a researcher, dedicated to the creation of knowledge. The rest will be automatically taken care of. A Friend in NeedIt was the right mail and at right time. I met Pin… only in the web space. She is sister of my ex-student and infrequent ‘philosophical’ discussion  is the common chord amongst us. Pin… forwarded this anecdote yesterday.Arthur Ashe, the legendary Wimbledon player was dying of AIDS which he got due to infected blood he received during a heart surgery in 1983. From world over, he received letters from his fans, one of which conveyed: \"Why does GOD have to select you for such a bad disease\"? To this Arthur Ashe replied: \"The world over -- 50 million children start playing tennis, 5 million learn to play tennis, 500,000 learn professional tennis, 50,000 come to the circuit, 5000 reach the grand slam, 50 reach Wimbledon, 4 to semi final, 2 to the finals, when I was holding a cup I never asked GOD 'Why me?'. And today in pain I should not be asking GOD 'Why me?' \"Shubho Rathayatra and other Shubh NewsThe Rathayatra festival started last Sunday. That evening attended ‘Puja’ at a friend’s residence. This evening we had an opportunity to visit the fair ground and had Sri Jagannath Darshan. Enjoyed the fair very much. Snaps taken by my 9 year old daughter is attached for the readers! It may give some relief to them in this otherwise heavy post. There are some 'Shubh' news too. One of my ex-PhD student is getting married at last :-) We often went after him and he kept assuring. He was very happy and excited to inform and rang home in the evening to talk to family members. He insists that we make ourselves available for all the three days, from marriage to reception. Let's see how it is possible. Our best wishes to him. With this happy note let me say, goodbye and good night!"},

The mother and son came all the way from Pune, Maharashtra. The son got a very good rank in IIT-JEE and should not find it difficult to get Electronics & Communication Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. The boy won many a laurels before this and his look, appearance make one remember \"Shradhhaban labhate Gnanam\" (wisdom dawns the person who is respectful).The mother said, \"I have heard about you from many and would like to have some time from you regarding my son's admission into IIT.\" I could not conceal my bewilderment that they have crossed the entire breadth of the country and asked, \"Why IIT Kharagpur? Don't you read so much of negative press reports about IIT Kharagpur?\" To this, the mother said, \"I know what IIT Kharagpur is. I used to be a teacher in an engineering college. Besides that several friends of my son study here.\" I tried to answer all that they asked with standard disclaimer \"as perceived by me.\" In addition stressed on the point that stepping into an IIT is not the end of it. It is a big step no doubt for a young student but neverthless only a step. One has to look higher and much beyond and make the best use of the facilities the country can afford.\"Please give me some valuable guidance for admission in IIT ...\"This was another student emailing from Solan, Himachal Pradesh who cleared IIT JEE this year. I suggested him to follow a webpage and added few lines from my side.\"If you are among toppers at 1st year, then you get an option to move to a  branch of ur choice in 2nd year at IIT Kharagpur. If you are topper in  your branch (whatever it is) you can expect a very good job irrespective  of branch.\"If you have a passion for a specific branch, go for  it.

For last 8 days, I am experiencing what can be correlated to living on footpath (correlation > 0.8 :-))- cramped, dust, pebbles all around. But I have a fan and a mosquito net and a working TV to give company. It is quite an educative experience and to understand what is our minimum requirement. Our quarter is going through a massive renovation. My only worry if the work will be completed in time i.e. before the arrival of family members next Sunday (school reopens next Monday after vacation). Else, there is no problem.The other day I was talking to the supervisor about the health hazard of such civil works, the amount of dust a worker inhales. Can we adopt a technology which is dust free and less hazardous? May be placing of factory made pre-fabricated blocks, one after another can help. I saw one individual building a house on his own through such blocks with the help of a fork-lift and a small crane. This was Trento, Italy and several years back. May be we want labour intensive technology here to get more people employed. But can it not be less hazardous?"},
{"title": "Melancholy", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2011", "text": "It's cyclic! There is a sadness in air. There is nothing wrong with any of the conventional parameters. All are doing fine and moving in the right directions. But I am having a job at hand. This is to make calls on various works / issues. The judgemental role never suits me. I try my best to avoid it. It is the toughest job to please all and meet or beat expectation of each, many of which are irrational to the core or highly emotional in nature. The role played, I remain prepared for the 'I-am-not-happy' faces. Probably people find me too puritans / conservative / idealistic / perfectionist (I have often heard these terms and the speaker was not actually praising :-)) in dealing with issues. I respect the right of everybody to feel the way one likes. I do not feel too much surprised to see little bit of selfishness in the demands made. In fact, most of us belong to that category and thus it does not disturb. It saddens if that selfishness becomes out of proportion and denies existence or right of others.Shared sorrow, half the sorrow! It is said, shared joy is double the joy and shared sorrow is half the sorrow. I infrequently, may be once a month, talk to an elderly relative over phone. This family is going through some difficult times over last two years. It came all on a sudden and apparently from nowhere. It is very difficult for one to establish a cause-effect relationship. They are a kind of losing faith in themselves and the virtuousness of the world, that it is all about being good and doing good. If honesty, truthfulness, service, dutifulness count, which they have adhered to all the time, then why such a fate is met out to them? While I talk to them, I try to say a few things which I read or heard from wise people; not sure at all how much I have digested that myself. All that I try to say, it is important to hang on and have faith.Healer, heal thyself! Last night as a bed time reading I was going through the selected works of Swami Vivekananda. Interestingly, one page in the section called \"Inspired Talks\" opened. This was a note taken by a disciple on 25th June, 1995. And behold! isn't it 'the issue' I am facing right now? I reproduce at bottom a selection from that notes. The whole of it can be found here(Link).Debbani I may say that now I am better placed to talk to myself and the elderly relative. For that I looked for the Bengali translation of this note, to read out directly from Vivekananda to the relative. Checked the central library database. It is there. In the evening, I got an opportunity to visit the library and found one very old edition published in 1965. This article was there in Vol. IV of Bengali Complete Works under the title \"Debbani\". The most interesting part of course comes next. The book in the rack already had a page marker. It pointed to exactly the same place where this specific write-up was there. It appears that the previous reader also found the article very useful. The person in the issuing counter said that he occasionally visits Belur Math and brings Vivekananda literature from there for his family.Vivekananda Speaks:After every happiness comes misery; they may be far apart  or  near. The more advanced the soul, the more quickly does one follow  the other. What  we want is neither happiness nor misery. Both  make us forget our true  nature; both are chains — one iron, one gold;  behind both is the Atman, who  knows neither happiness nor misery. These  are states and states must  ever change; but the nature of the  Soul is bliss, peace, unchanging. We have  not to get it, we have it;  only wash away the dross and see it. Stand upon the Self, then only can we truly love the  world. Take a very,  very high stand; knowing out universal nature, we  must look with perfect  calmness upon all the panorama of the  world. It is but baby's play, and  we know that, so cannot be disturbed  by it. If the mind is pleased with praise,  it will be displeased with  blame. All pleasures of the senses or even of the  mind are evanescent  but within ourselves is the one true unrelated pleasure,  dependent upon  nothing. It is perfectly free, it is bliss. The more our  bliss is within, the more spiritual we are. The pleasure of the Self is  what the world calls religion.  There is no possibility of ever having pleasure without  pain, good without  evil; for living itself is just the lost  equilibrium. What we want is freedom,  not life, nor pleasure, nor good.  Creation is infinite, without beginning and  without end — the  ever-moving ripple in an infinite lake. There are yet  unreached depths  and others where the equilibrium has been regained; but the  ripple is  always progressing, the struggle to regain the balance is eternal.  Life  and death are only different names for the same fact, the two sides of  the  one coin. Both are Maya, the inexplicable state of striving at one  time to  live, and a moment later to die. Beyond this is the true  nature, the Atman.  While we recognize a God, it is really only the Self  which we have separated  ourselves from and worship as outside of us;  but it is our true Self all the  time — the one and only God.  The world for me, not I for the world. Good and evil are  our slaves, not we  theirs. It is the nature of the brute to remain  where he is (not to progress);  it is the nature of man to seek good and  avoid evil; it is the nature of God to  seek neither, but just to be  eternally blissful. Let us be God! Make the heart  like an ocean, go  beyond all the trifles of the world, be mad with joy even at  evil; see  the world as a picture and then enjoy its beauty, knowing that  nothing  affects you. Children finding glass beads in a mud puddle, that is the   good of the world. Look at it with calm complacency; see good and evil  as the  same — both are merely \"God's play\"; enjoy all."},
{"title": "CEO : Aaram Se", "date": "Thursday, May 5, 2011", "text": "This is a quick follow up of the previous post (Link) after reading Mukesh Ambani (MA) interview in Economic Times(ET) (Link). I cannot but resist myself from quoting three answers of this interview that dwells on the human resources, being responsible in investment considering shareholder's interest and philanthropic activity at personal level. I have emphasized certain parts of the answers that struck me a lot and want readers to take special note of. After completing previous post I was thinking, were it all philosophical / theoretical? We may accept that there is truth for the sake of argument but feel skeptic if they can be practised! After reading this interview I feel more convinced about its applicability to corporate houses. This reminds and reinforces what we hear from Viveknanda, \"That society is the greatest where the highest truths become practical.\"I have included 'Aaram Se' from 2nd ans. of MA interview in the post title as I find it very interesting. Bhagabad Gita says that the mark of a wise man / Yogi is intense activity in intense rest or calmness and intense rest or calmness in intense activity. Let me quote this part from here (Link)\"He who sees in the midst of intense activity, intense calm, and in the midst of intensest peace is intensely active [is wise indeed]. (GITA IV, 18.) ... This is the question: With every sense and every organ active, have you that tremendous peace [so that] nothing can disturb you? Standing on Market Street, waiting for the car with all the rush ... going on around you, are you in meditation — calm and peaceful? In the cave, are you intensely active there with all quiet about you? If you are, you are a Yogi, otherwise not. ---- I think that enough ground has been prepared to hear what MA said. Let's read it Aaram Se :-) ----ET : Are you looking at grooming talent in-house ? Or getting new fresh talent?          MA : We are doing a combination of everything. Fundamentally, we  think it requires re-engineering or regenerating the whole human  resources architecture. It's very difficult to do. When you think about  performance, it's not only people architecture or talent but people  performing in a growth-nurturing ecology. You really have to regenerate  the environment. It's like colleges. I have been on the advisory board  of Stanford and a few other colleges where we change the environment  every 10 years. At this stage, we are going through a project where we  will have a process whereby we will take everything we have learnt and  really mentor and train our 30-34-year-old guys to be better than us.  It's a regeneration of the 4-5 pillars we stand on...and not only our  existing talent but also welcoming fresh talent. We want our people to  be internally happy, because happiness and success should go together. I  want everybody at RIL to achieve their true potential . We want to  create a new culture in which you will be reasonably transparent to  yourself, your peers and your team. That, in my mind, will lead to true  innovation . This is the most important and exciting project of my life:  How do you really transform and reengineer 40,000-50 ,000 people, most  of them professionals, most of them ambitious, most of them very  successful, and then tell them to mentor and train 30-34-year-olds and  make them better than us. This, according to me, is the sign of a truly  New Age business organisation. ET : Many  speculate you will make a big-ticket acquisition and in your last AGM,  you had said that you will plant the tricolour in many parts of the  world. Any progress on that front?          MA : We look at these things on an ongoing basis. There will be a lot  of volatility and uncertainty in this world. But, I'm a wildlife fan. I  love the leopard. The leopard sits on top of a tree. It doesn't take any  great risks. Whenever it sees that it can make a kill, it's in no hurry  whatsoever to make a kill. It makes the kill so rapidly, you don't even  know. And I've actually sat with leopards for hours in lots of forests.  It just happens in a flash. And, again, the leopard goes back and sits  there aaram se. So, as I tell all our guys, let's not get too much  carried away. It's important to keep the balance sheet capability to do  this stuff but we shouldn't be in a hurry. We should be watching , we  shouldn't be ignoring anything. But unless we feel absolutely safe that  we are not going to hurt ourselves, and we are going to go down there,  kill 100% and bring it back, we won't do anything funny. We are in no  hurry. And we'll never do it for ego's sake. Our watchword is: does it  generate value for our shareholders on a sustainable and long-term  basis? What do you think of the giving pledge?          There are different points of view. My own view is that it's  important that one should create sustainability and compassion. My view  is that giving must be anonymous. Even if I did whatever I did, I  wouldn't brag about it. I would do it for my own satisfaction . It is  important you do it straight off your heart you don't talk about it."},
{"title": "CEO", "date": "Monday, May 2, 2011", "text": "\"Life is short. The vanities of the world are transient. They only live who live for others. The rest are more dead than alive.\" - Swami VivekanandaInfosys This morning I was reading the post-departure scenario of Mohandas Pai after his resignation from Infosys. I vividly remember the way he defended Infosys numbers year after year in front of live camera. He departed because he was not elevated to the post of CEO which he thought he deserved more than others. He complained about discrimination and lack of transparency and retracted that later. To this Narayana Murthy, Infosys Chairman and Chief Mentor said, “We must be very kind to him (Pai) because at times we all lose our  rational thinking and make an emotional statement. After all, we have to  be very kind and forgiving,” He added, “If there are two people who are as capable as each other, how will you  choose one of them? Both are equal in all respects. So, you have to  choose the experienced one, and that’s what we have done,” (Link)Wipro, Reliance, ICICI BankWhile Pai's CEO ambition was not fulfilled, we found summary exit of joint CEO of Wipro three months ago. And we heard this from Girish Paranjape, one of the joint CEO. \"For the last 24 years every day, I  have been busy thinking about what to do for Wipro tomorrow. Now I will  have to start thinking about what to do for myself.” (Link) The bitter succession struggle of Dhirubhai Ambani empire is well known. Even the mother failed to make mends between warring brothers. Finally, there appears to be a work level understanding but the scar is still visible. The ICICI Bank succession  was less bloody. The deft handling of K V Kamath, the outgoing CEO had a containing effect. It is great to see Chhanda Kochhar emerging as a great leader at ICICI Bank in her unassuming, 'yours-in-service' style while the contender Shikha Sharma leading Axis Bank to new heights. Lessons from a princeEverybody needs a space. Everybody wants to excel. Everybody wants to reach the top. In the famous Satyajt Ray movie (today is the birthday of this legendary film maker) 'Nayak (the Hero)', the lead character says, \"I want to go to the top, to the top, to the top.\"While the above is true, there are few more fundamental truth that eludes us. Rather we want to pretend as if they do not exist. I am talking about what occurred to the young prince when he saw three different scenes in three different trips. On the first trip, he met an old man, on the second a sick man,          and on the third he met a group of people carrying a corpse to the cremation          ground. He realized that age will catch up with us (capacity will decrease and we have to make room for others), diseases are inevitable (the best hospital, treatment not withstanding - the instruments are to fail someway or the other) and finally, we have to leave everything behind, all that we loved, cared and built. The anecdotes including a fourth scene are nicely described here (Link1, Link2, Link3, Link4).MotiveIs there a reconciliation anywhere? Does one renounce everything and become a monk then? Is that prescribed for all? Will not one try to go to 'top'? Of course, one will. But what is the motive behind? Is it self-gratification or to flaunt vanity? The truth is that they are transient. Or is it because I get a greater opportunity to serve others? If one looks at the constitution, one will find that the job of a CEO is to protect shareholder's value and serve shareholder's interest. The 'trusteeship' is embedded, implied in all top positions. Is it all philosophical?TATA Group : TCS, Tata Motors, Tata SteelTATA group shows a more matured response in CEO succession plan. Be it change of guard at TCS with Ramadorai making way for younger generation or Muthuraman from Tata Steel, Ravi Kant from Tata Motors - commoners like us did not feel any tremor. Perhaps the group could instill a value system that does not believe in going at top and remaining there 'at any cost' or Ratan Tata factor is there. It is to be seen how Ratan Tata is succeeded at Tata Sons. However, they are making enough noise to sensitize people, two steps forward - one step backward etc. to get a new leader accepted by the community.Test of time The test of time is the real test. The founding members of any organization (Corporate, NGOs) who create usually have a lot of fire, zeal, passion in them. It is not necessary to get people who share the vision and one needs to groom them. These days 'DNA' (Link) is the buzzword for corporate houses which is directed towards this and also the perpetuity. Not so easy though when it comes to taking big decisions. There is fight within oneself while one passes the baton and relinquishes the power and with it all the limelight. Often one tries to float with the thought - newcomers does not have as much experience, will make 'mistake' and I must hang on. What happens if no space is given? Vivekananda says that if you do not allow one to become a lion he may land up being a fox.3 'H' and HCL TechnologiesIf we consider 3 'H' - Heart (emotion, feelings), Head (rational thinking), Hand (Hard work) as parameters, are they in same proportion in founding members who 'create' and the next generation who take it forward? Left to itself, Heart component may be more in the former and Head in the later while both can be very Hard working. What is required is a balanced development of all the 3 'H's amongst all and leaders are expected to lead by examples. Besides this, whatever DNA we talk about are phrases which are useful at a particular point of time and not DNA as such. DNA is something to be inherited and replicated.These phrases however, can be very useful and may help an organization to tide over a situation. About 4 years back I was going through Annual Report of HCL Technologies. It had just started turning round its businesses which had been going through a bad patch. They used 'Focus, Lead, Dominate' a three worded phrase to remind themselves of the task ahead. I am happy to say that I could easily connect to it myself because of the ground situation prevailing then :-)  DisclaimerWhen you talk about corporate houses, equity, shareholding etc. there is a standard disclaimer. I do not think that this post has anything to do with financial investment or investment decision of any individual. Rather it is more of a philosophical note directed towards youth to make them aware of facets of life, help them take informed decision and develop character qualities which in turn may help them, their organization, nation going forward.Still to be on the safer side let me declare the following. The corporate houses mentioned above as a part of case study are jewels of India. Information used is taken from media - television, web and print. In early nineties I worked in Tata Steel for about 4.5 years in a junior position and have no relation since then. I do have small equity investment in most of the companies named above and would like all of them to be successful, stand the test of time and enhance the worth of my little share holding :-)Warren BuffetLet us get back to the context. Some students in Google Buzz shared some interesting aspects of Warren Buffet's life few days back. Buffet is the Chairman & CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is one of the most consistent among the wealthiest in the world and has donated more than USD 30 bn to charity. He still lives in a 3 bed room house he bought 50 years ago. He says that he has everything he needs in that house. It does not have any wall or fence. He drives his own car and does not have any driver or security. He never travels by private jet though he owns world's largest private jet company.Buffet asks top executives of 63 companies under his command to follow two rules.Rule 1 : Do not lose any of your share holder's money.Rule 2 : Do not forget Rule 1.MessageWhat does Buffet advise to young people? The five points I like to reproduce are as follows.1. Money does not create man but it is the man who created money.2. Live your life as simple as you are.3. Do not do what others say, just listen them, do what you feel good.4. Don't go on brand names, just wear those in which you feel comfortable.5. Don't waste your money on unnecessary things, just spend on them who really in need rather.Graceful degradationEverything that has a beginning, has an end. This is one axiom of life that has stood the test of time. One may need to have a graceful exit plan. The exit plan is nicely written down by saints of this land. This starts as soon as a baby is born and not left pre-retirement ages. It goes like this, \"Jab Tum Paida Hue To Jag Hansa Tum Roye / Aisi Karni Kar Chalo, Tum Hanse Jag Roye.\" (You cried when you were born and the world smiled. Lead a life such that when you leave, the world cries and you smile.) For institutions, a graceful degradation means giving enough warning signals in advance to help the boarders take another ship and not get drowned mid-sea. Requires a lot of courage but it comes when one finds himself in many. I have seen tears in the eyes of colleagues for individuals leaving an institution. Love, selflessness are very much practical and one has to practise it to get a taste of it, it is much tastier than everything else in life (Link) !!!\"Unselfishness is more paying, only people have not the patience to practise it.\" - Vivekananda"},
{"title": "Counselling", "date": "Friday, April 22, 2011", "text": "Dream \"Dream is not what you see in sleep. Dream is the thing which does not let you sleep.\"This evening I got a call from the adjacent computer room which was then under command and control of Her Highness! I was at my relaxed best watching television - after an 8 hours stay at office on an Institute holiday! If one sneers that 'watching television' in the evening is too low level an activity to be engaged in, I have some techno-social explanation to offer. This can be weakly related to 'Nyquist Frequency'. I was covertly experimenting what could be the ideal sampling frequency of watching channels in a multiplexed condition. Multiplexing here refers to the techno part and is not related to 'multiplexes' society in general relates to and television brings the society in its all hues colours in our drawing room! Yes, I was watching IPL 4, two Bengali news channels covering state election, one Hindi channel depicting life of Sai Baba, two English news channel giving miscellaneous news and one movie channel simultaneously in a time sampled manner!!!!In the middle of doing such a serious job which had the potential of developing 'Goutam's Frequency' of channel surfing, came the call - too powerful to ignore! Her Highness appeared to be quite excited. She was there to look for some missed episodes of her favourite TV serial from the net. What happened? Is there an n-th reincarnation of a character who died (n-1)th time p episodes back? As I entered, I saw a photograph of Dr. Kalam on the computer screen which carried above quote. She was writing down in a piece of paper the neo-definition of dream, very excited.Wish all of us take a mental note of it and live for a dream.PostponedFlashback to yesterday evening. The review meeting was just over. The reviewer seems to be quite pleased. They talked about how to take the work forward. They were referring to protecting IP (Intellectual Property i.e. patenting), commericialization of this piece of technology on biometric authentication. Lots of suggestions received for developments of sub-IPs. There was quite a good amount of feel-good factor amongst all. This area too was also considered to be at an inflection point and expect to catch up, in terms of recognition, with what our lab. got in biomedical area.Next, this project team gathered in my office. We discussed the next steps, the division of labour etc.. We were to attend dinner arranged as a part of this review. Towards the end of this meeting, I turned my attention to one project student who remained absent without information, appears to take things not that seriously. I told, \"Hope you remember that your scolding is due and got postponed due to this project review! Today there is a dinner after this. Let us schedule it on Monday.\" The student said, \"I admit that I made a mistake. I deserve scolding. But can it be postponed to 29th (next Friday)? I have one exam. On 28th April.\" We agreed on that schedule. The other project student who faulted once, told  \"Please remember that my quota of scolding is done. You scolded me for two days.\"Concentration, Passion There was a new project student in this meeting who was surprised at how we conversed. I took an example which Sri Ramakrishna used to explain. Our mind is like mustard seeds in a bag that got pierced and became scattered all over, on a floor. It is so difficult to gather all of them and put them back in the bag. One has to practise concentration, meditation may be too much to expect for a beginner. There is a nice, short (only 2 pages) article on how to improve concentration here (Link). It is important to have control over mind and focus on research. The parallel sun rays if focused through a magnifying glass become so powerful that it can cause fire. Asked them to spend one month’s undivided attention to research and see how wonder works. Vivekananda said, \"The difference between an ordinary person and a great person is in the power of concentration.\"This morning I was listening to Mr. Ram Narayan of Dept. of Telecommunication, Govt. of India. He was referring to how we Indian lack in our temperament in approaching research problem. We treat it as a job. If the clock strikes 9 PM, we feel tired and think that we have done is enough. (Yes, he said 9 PM ... and one may not be surprised to see people who are mentally off at 6:00 PM or even earlier.) He continued to share his wisdom. The people who  ‘çreate’ and with whom we compete internationally, not only remain awake for one night but many nights. Madam Curie sold her house to fund research. Such  passion is somehow missing. He further said, ‘Failure’ is not when you fail but when you do not get up.Originality Few days back one UG student asked for an appointment. The student finds the mode of instruction, evaluation unexciting and wants to go to the bottom of a topic that is liked. The fellow students do not like that approach and thus cannot strike a cord. Communication became a problem amongst them. I discussed how the world is hungry for originality. The originality is to be preserved for the good. Being original is a virtue and this is an important ingredient that helps to create.Then we discussed how doing well in exam. is important even if that means being monotonous at times. The better one does in exam., the more time and confidence one has to pursue one's original thinking. A not so capable person looks for advantageous proposition only. A capable person can convert any proposition to his/her advantage. It is not at all difficult to do well in academics in IIT system because of continuous evaluation if someone is serious. It was admitted that the regularity had been missing in study and that would be corrected. Nice to see that the student comes occasionally in google chat and is trying to remain engaged. My best wishes.Tough TaskGot a kind of distress call from an elder sometime back for their ward, a college student. It is very common these days to get into a relationship in college days. Initially, I declined thinking it is not correct to come into personal space of a 20 years old. But the parents continued to ask me to counsel. They neither agree nor disagree to that relationship but wants the commitment part to be postponed by few more years; till the college education is over, till the youngsters get adequate time to be acquainted with the world, become some more matured.I must say that it was one of the toughest task of recent times. My first such engagement. Tried to convey the parents argument to the ward and vice-versa. In the process, when all were present, my own view was sought. I don't think there is any prize to guess what I said. I don't claim to be an expert. And there seems to be too many experts around. Also often while trying to do 'mentoring', we try to 'control' others and impose ourselves, without respecting the journey of an individual.Experts SpeakTherefore, it is best left to those who are not street smart. I  would like to refer to this very very beautiful discourse of a  Ramakrishna Mission Monk that can be found here (Link). Another wonderful discourse from from a teacher who now gives lecture to Ramakrishna Mission monks can be found here (Link) that talks about life's goal, the benefit one can derive by following higher thoughts and ideals.The 2nd lecture was addressed to students of Sister Nibedita School of Kolkata. He talked about how there is improvement in confidence, concentration.Almost a month back I was watching one episode of 'Awakening with Brahma Kumaris' where Sister Shivani dealt this nicely. I have not been able to locate that in youtube. But in this one (Link) Sister gives almost a 360 degree view on 'Personality Development' and puts the responsibility on oneself. She was addressing an audience where there were many young members.Finally, this Kids Marshmallow Experiment on 'Self Control' which is referred even by Scientific Americana is not simply hilarious. It shows how our reward system works and how we learn to deal with temptation and develop our own mechanism to handle it. If a child can do that, why not we elders? We know very well the kind of reward waiting for us when we achieve our research goal. Let us exercise our will power and remain a life long learner."},
{"title": "Holidaying", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2011", "text": "RelievedJust now Benida rang and told that Kounish's father has returned from Chaitanyapur Eye Hospital and the eye is saved. We were all worried. We saw 'Kaku' working in a coal shop in our younger days, struggling hard to cope up with life. Both the sons, Koushik and Kounish were some years junior to me but we played together in BNR ground. Koushik joined Ramakrishna Mission. Kounish now works under a distributor of consumer goods. Several occasions we met in Tech. market. Few days back Kounish rang, was at a loss what to do. The doctor has referred to Disha Eye Hospital and they have asked to arrange a large sum. Benida knew about Chaitanyapur Eye Hospital near Haldia run by Vivekananda Mission Ashram and they do such a wonderful job. And they did it again. Heartfelt thanks!Oh! It's a holiday.This had been one of the most hectic day of recent times. In the morning, one ex-student, now with TCS came in chat. I answered that today is a sudden holiday under NI act. And we get to work more on holidays when the distractions are less. Completed setting up of two exam. papers. One in the morning and the other in the evening. Scheduled a 3 PM meeting with research students which ended at 7:45 PM. This accomplished a much needed review of our various strategic initiatives and take a stock of tens of leads we are pursuing.Staff vs. StudentWork in a research  lab. is not an office job. Pushing the reporting time from 9 AM to 9:30 AM, then 10 AM and so on, leaving campus in the weekend (without permission) compulsively, extending the weekend, not following reporting structure etc. do not help one to stay focused on research problem or derive the most from IIT infrastructure and research environment. We try our best to remind our those students who think themselves more as staffs than students of these pitfalls and how important it is to maintain focus.Man is a social animalPeople in this part of the country perhaps are more social than others, which of course is good when society is getting fragmented, families are becoming nuclear. But it comes with its own problem for those who are supposed to be in 'student mode'. There comes a social pressure to attend every single birthday, marriage function, first-rice-ceremony, this and that of all the people I know or and share a cord. The emotional self gets better of us. We find it difficult to say, \"No\", not to hurt feelings of others. I myself have experienced this and still experience it because of my very large social network. But somehow I have been able to communicate well and make my community feel that they have a stake, a share in whatever work I do at IIT and how important these are. I talk to them about our research, work in a language they can appreciate. It is their kindness, magnanimity that not only the bond is strong and healthy but also they inquire time to time how the work is going on here.Abhyas (striving) and Vairagya (detachment) Urge research students to make your community a stake holders in whatever you do and they will try to create a congenial atmosphere for you and ask you not to get defocused. Please act before it is too late. It is your career. These 2-4 years are very crucial. This is the most productive phase of the young and intelligent. Yesterday, we had a snacks break in between our research meeting. One new faculty joined us in Tikka. He was discussing the difference between a research student of China and that of US. And one can see the difference how these two nations have come up in recent times. The research students in India need not follow a 7 days a week culture but definitely do more than what they are doing now. The story says that God was not happy creating all forms of life till man was created, as the formers did not have the ability to realize the creator. When one realizes God becomes God himself. The power is there but latent. One has to strive. The scripture talks about twin principles, 'Abhyas' (striving) and 'Bairagya' (Detachment). If we remain too much attached with surroundings, we shall not be able to concentrate. Unless we strive and focus our energy, the nature will not reveal its secret.Choose your idealWe try our best to recruit the right kind of people for the lab. ... the  ones who have passion for research, ones who are trainable, ones who  are hard working, ones who want to dive deep and immerse fully. None of  us are super talented. It is the combination of whatever talent  we have and hard work that make us deliver. New comers to the lab. should take note of this. Please draw inspiration from performers in the lab. Please see their track record, their effort, their devotion, their sincerity.Welcoming fresh bloodYes, we are gearing up to welcome three new students (not staffs, please!) in our lab. We are filling up all the three positions that we advertized recently. We are keeping one in waiting list, in case somebody does not join. One thing was noticeable in this round of recruitment. It appeared that a good number of these candidates have genuine desire for a research career. This is a welcome change. Some of these candidates are from industries and little bit out of touch. Some are willing to sacrifice their faculty job and be a part of our team. One candidate appreciates that the performance should have been better and wants to prepare for the next selection and seeks guidance.HumbledI must say that I am overwhelmed and humbled by this keenness. Wish all of you who are really interested get an opportunity to fulfill your research dream. Usually, we are asked to submit projects but we do not do as there is a scarcity of committed manpower to service when projects are granted. I think, we can explore new projects now.Resources To those who are looking for guidance may refer to NPTEL (Link) resources. Please brush up the fundamentals of core subjects. If you are to be called an engineer in a particular field, the basics of core subjects should be known. One may forget minute details if one remains out f touch for long. But if the fundamentals are clear (what this chapter says and why is it useful - basic equations / graph / table and their significances) then one knows where to start if a problem is given. Be it a drawing of CMOS inverter, transistor characteristics curve, getting a non-inverting amplifier from OP-AMP, definition of Discrete Fourier Transform, Truth Table / Excitation Table of Flip-Flops, Design steps of filters, Difference between Synchronous / Asynchronous counter, Difference between C and C++, writing simple codes for basic mathematical manipulation or reading / writing files ......... we often find candidates appear clueless. Also one should be comfortable with detailing of projects done or proficiencies claimed in biodata.We often tell people interested to work with us to brush up Digital Signal Processing (Link1 and Link2), gather some idea on Pattern Recognition (Link1 and Link2 : Low cost Indian Edition is available for the book \"Pattern Classification\" by Duda and Hart : May not have been exposed as this subject is a PG core or UG elective ... basic understanding will do, details can be learnt in course of time.) and have familiarity with MATLAB (If one has MATLAB loaded in own machine then can play with codes of this Link or other stuffs available on web). MATLAB is gently and systematically introduced in this Analog and Digital Communication Text (Link) and the companion website's student centre (Link) provides downloadable MATLAB mini-projects and codes. Similar feature is offered for Verilog HDL language in this text (Link) and the downloadable stuffs in student centre (Link).NSSTalked to Jugal Babu, a devoted High School teacher this evening on a new free coaching centre our NSS volunteers have planned. It is on course. Just now the student volunteer pinged. Their team had been very very responsible and are showing a matured approach. If IITians come forward like these and help the community it will truly be leading from the front. Proud of these young volunteers.Shubho Poila Baisakh (Happy Bengali New Year)Time to say good night. It is 1:30 AM. Have an 8:30 AM class. Shubho Poila Baisakh (Happy Bengali New Year) to all. While typing this post was going through some of the PPTs 2nd Year UG students are sending by mail for their mini-projects. Some of the ideas (not implemented) like Moving PPT slides by voice command during presentation, Lie Detection, Communication with Extra Terrestrial Intelligence appear interesting. Let's see how they present.You have earned one more tomorrowSure that earned one more tomorrow for what I have done today :-)  ..... pasting one poem that is my favourite for long.Is anybody happier because you passed this way?Does anyone remember that you spoke to them today?The day is almost over, and its toiling time is through.Is there anyone to utter now a kindly word of you?Can you say tonight in parting with the day that's slipping fast,That you helped a single person of the many that you passed?Is a single heart rejoicing over what you did or said?Does the one whose hopes were fading now with courage look ahead?Did you waste the day or use it? Was it well or sorely spent?Did you leave a trail of kindness, or a scar of discontent?As you close your eyes in slumber, do you think that God will say:\"You have earned one more tomorrow by what you did today?\""},
{"title": "Hiring Again : 3 positions vacant", "date": "Monday, April 4, 2011", "text": "“A mistake often made by freshers is that they run after high-paying jobs. In the initial stages,  don’t mix career and money. Your priority should be the job profile  based on your capabilities, which will help you hone your skills and  grow. Once you’re established, the money will come,” ~ Nidhi Gaur, Head, HR, Wiley IndiaWhoever said that match is made in heaven was more than philosophical. The practicalities on earth show that it is not easy to get students who are serious and not looking at project positions as stop-gap opportunities. Equally difficult is to find students who love academic environment, research and have good fundamentals. This points to quality or more correctly, the lack of it. Often wonder, with thousands of engineering colleges around, why are we facing such a scenario? Is it like - water, water everywhere; not a drop to drink? Do not want to sound pessimistic at all. Rather urge engineering students to work on the fundamentals, develop passion for research and an attitude to scale higher altitudes, have faith in self. There are plenty of opportunities in IIT research lab.s, waiting to be grabbed. Trying once again with this round of walk-in-interview. The selected candidates, if qualifies Dept. test, can register for higher degree from IIT. In the past, all eligible did qualify the test. Besides this, it offers an opportunity to work in a challenging research environment, a great team, good infrastructure and IIT brand. Trying to sell hard :-)Worth every rupee as getting a right candidate is not just the first step but the most important one. Well, from a candidate's point of view, getting a right research problem, research environment and research advisor mean a lot. Today's Economic Times in a career advice (Link) tells that such a career should be selected in initial years that allows one to hone skill in one's area of interest and asks not to go after money. If one attains skill, the money will come later, thick and fast. The compensation we offer in project positions is not bad but more than that, IIT lab. environment offers no limit to attain skills.Let's see how well the match is made this time.

{"title": "Indian Innovations", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2011", "text": "Today the special edition of Economic Times ran a cover story on Indian Innovations. The web edition can be found here (Link). The author Kamya Jaiswal writes in the introduction \"There is no rumbling of  change. The transition has not shown up in any statistic. But it has  happened. India is innovating. It is genuine, it is grass roots, it has  commercial value-and it is distinct from the jugaad we are best known  for.\" Later the difference between 'jugaad' and 'innovation' has been graphically illustrated. Economic Times has taken up 6 works  in detail and another 3 to illustrate their points on innovation culture in India. Our work on heart sound analyzer and lung  sound analyzer (patent filing process at IIT Kharagpur is just  completed) gets a major referrence (page 15). I have attached a few screen shots  here. Click on them to enlarge. ET has come up with another article titled, \"Nine innovations that are likely to change our lives\". This is available here (Link1, direct Link2 and Link3)Yesterday, while delivering the 43rd  convocation address of Utkal University, Sam Pitroda, Chairman, National Innovation Council said, ''Only innovation  and technology can save higher education in  India.\" Later he said. \"We don't need lots of  teachers. The teachers don't need to create or impart content to  students anymore. The role of teachers has changed to that of mentors.\" As mentioned in earlier posts (Link1, segment 9 of  Link2 ), the students here are being motivated to come up with prototypes through system level developments. For younger ones, where lot of theoretical understanding is still to be captured, a reduced feature versions are encouraged. For seniors, we would like to encourage team work. Some work on the data acquisition subsystem, some work on decision making subsystem, some work on the display and platform which will house the technology etc.I thankfully acknowledge the contribution of my research team which include present and past students as well as technical staffs, in whatever little we could achieve. I am just the face. It is these individuals who deserve all the kudos. Proud to be a part of this great team and this great institute. Thankful to colleagues, family members, collaborators, well-wishers for their constant encouragement. Seek good wishes from everyone so that we can live up to the expectation."},
{"title": "At a Glance", "date": "Sunday, March 20, 2011", "text": "FestivalHappy Holi to all! Kesaria Balam Padharo Mahre Desh. The tune had been visiting for quite some time; since the time we were returning from a trip with Republic Day skit team of NSS. There was an antakshari competition arranged by the students in the return journey on a MUV. Yesterday was the super moon evening. Seven families gathered at the residence of one of our colleagues and celebrated Basanta Purnima with song and recitation. The musical extravaganza started at 8 p.m. and continued till midnight. The mood was to continue even further but for the kids, who however did not show any sign of fatigue. While most of the songs were Rabindrasangeet, one Rajasthani folk song took us far at the other side of the country in the land of desert.Sponsored ResearchHad been quite busy in between. There were reviews of five sponsored projects one after another. One more to go. Another big project has come where I have a good amount of responsibility in platform development and operationalizing the work. There were several visits of an MNC, interested in technology transfer of two our innovations in healthcare area. All these required a lot of team meetings and interaction with visitors. Also a certain amount of travel which I try to minimize to the extent possible. Being in station allows multitasking, to take care of many responsibilities simultaneously.Receiving a lot of requests from various universities which requires visit to their places. I have been advised to be selective so that the work at KGP does not suffer. We have almost all the right ingredients in place and enough funding. We are looking forward to taking up some audacious challenges. At the formulation / setting up of problem stage, I need to give more time to students. Gou.., my first M.S. student (had two Ph.D.s earlier!!) last month defended his thesis very well. He did some pioneering work in his 2.5 years of association with our lab. in the area of frame selection which reduces computational burden in automatic speaker recognition not just by a factor of 1.5 or 2 but 4 or in some cases 8. The work was immediately accepted by a reputed journal without any single correction. The MS thesis was accepted as it was by both the examiners. One examiner commented that it was almost a Ph.D. level work. Gou.. is now taking a break in his own chosen way and preparing to go abroad for Ph.D. work. Proud to have students like him and wish him the very best.Received research proposal from someone from abroad who wishes to join our group for a Ph.D. in speech processing area. He has excellent background, a BTech degree from top Indian Institute and Ph.D. from abroad with volumes of work experience. Dean (PGS&R) and Dept. Head welcomed it and the rule (citizenship and others) and procedure for getting fellowship etc. are being explained to him. On behalf of the research team, I appreciate and thankfully acknowledge every single event that encourages us, motivates us to deliver our very best.  CompensationThere was an unexpected ending to US edition project when the manuscript was fully ready after 2 years of hard work and the chapters received very good review. The publisher was hugely apologetic saying that the dollars offered to me is a token of appreciation and cannot compensate the passionate work put behind. Yes, I felt sad but only for a day or two. The US audience miss what is already there in new Indian edition and US edition was turning out to be even superior when I completed action on US reviews.Life moves on. One Editorial Head from the publisher’s Indian arm visited IIT Kharagpur thereafter and we discussed for hours to restart a 2 year old project which took backseat for the US edition. I shall start that work in summer vacation which is 1.5 months away.NSS WorkNational Service Scheme (NSS) occupied a large part of me in this period. National Youth Week celebration included a morning rally (Rally link) and an evening function involving village school teachers, panel discussion, exhibition of inter village school drawing competition, prize distribution, cultural program etc. (Link1, Link2)   This is the first time NSS was asked to put up a show in the Republic Day (Link) flag hoisting ceremony at stadium. The volunteers put up a nice skit on patriotic theme, urging people to participate in the national regeneration, shaking off ‘Sab chalta hai’ attitude. Aurko compeered it very well. Director, IIT Kharagpur was very pleased at the performance and made congratulatory remarks on NSS activities at IIT Kharagpur. We heard the same from one NSS Advisory Committee member who is not from IIT when he attended Youth week function. I shared these with the NSS team and all feel enthused, motivated.In fortnightly program officers’ meeting got to know how young IITians as NSS volunteers are reaching out to the underprivileged. In one secondary school in a backward slum area (first generation learners), all the classes from V to X (there are different sections in one class) on Saturday from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm are taken by IIT students. They teach mostly Vedic Math., English etc. complementary to what school teachers teach Mon-Fri. The Headmaster said that the feedback from the guardian had been very good. There are many such inspiring developments. It gives me so much of joy to see young IITians who generally represents the India part of the digital divide, getting acquainted with Bharat part. I think it will have far reaching effect in the mind of the IIT students as well as the community it is serving.Dean (Planning & Coordination) took special interest in seeing that NSS figures in our new communication directory. It was not there earlier. Further, on his advice, we have submitted our infrastructure requirement which will be a shared resource. He found the design well thought out. Two consecutive  such design - one for NSS and the other for a new lab. of the Dept. - I am gaining some experience in this too!Thanks GivingHad an opportunity to take Republic Day skit to a trip to make them feel special after their special performances on two consecutive days that made the entire NSS family proud.  A few could not make. Finally, there were ten of us and we hired a Tata Sumo. This was the birth anniversary of Sri Ramakrishna. The students did not know that. I was surprised when they gifted a Sri Ramakrishna idol to me to say ‘Thanks’. This was also a day where I had so many pics of me clicked on a single day. This collection can be found here (link).Few weeks back one program officer rang me one afternoon and I accompanied him along with two NSS student volunteers to a village about 5KM south of IIT Kharagpur. The villagers arranged a evening meet to say ‘Thanks’ to NSS, IIT Kharagpur. The volunteers worked hard to make water available in that village without which 300 families were to travel 2KM to nearest source of water, the well, ponds in the village gone dry. The meet was arranged in the evening as the villagers work as a daily labourer during day time. We sat in the ground (though they arranged chairs for us) with them. They managed a low power incandescent bulb from somewhere. All belong to backward castes, mostly scheduled tribes. They were sitting quietly, did not know how to say thanks but their eyes says it all. Finally, one young person (with whom NSS volunteers established connection first) said that they still cannot believe what is happening is for real. They never believed that there are people who think about their well-being and work for them. The previous Sunday NSS volunteers were there till 7 pm and left only when they saw that mother earth is delivering the water to her those children who need it the most.Slowly we got into conversation. They talked about issues they are facing on getting ST certificates etc. We told how we can assist them. They accepted our position when we said that as National Service Scheme volunteers, ours is to serve and not criticize any or finding fault with any. As the conversation was in the local language, I was translating it into English for the NSS volunteers in between. To my surprise, many a villagers told that they were able to understand what I was telling in English. At the end of 1 hour meet one school-going teen of the village came forward and said if it is possible for NSS to open a weekly ‘Spoken English’ program for 7-8 teens like him. To come it from a first generation school-goers of a backward village was surprising and the student volunteers immediately agreed on a Saturday afternoon slot.Uttamda's BlogI got this message from Uttamda once he returned. \"My dear Goutam,Good morning. Yesterday I have created the blog as per your instruction. Thank you. Please visit www.ukchatterjee@blogspot.com With best wishes, Uttamda\". And in one month what did he deliver! Gems - one after another. I simply kept this link in my google status space. Students here told me that they benefited a lot from these writings. Uttamda once worried about quality of English, language skill etc. I requested him to ignore that and it is the substance for which the world is hungry. One day, I got a ping in my google chat. This was Ch.., an IIT Kharagpur alumnus studying in a top US university, top most in some estimate.7:57 AM Ch...: This blog is excellent. Thanks so much for sharing. :)7:58 AM me:  Thanks Chintan. He is a very simple person. ....8:02 AM Ch...: I think a person is as strong as his or her thoughts. Then it doesn't matter what his or her background is.8:03 AM He has written about very simple things, but with powerful take-aways.We are OneSome of the senior IIT students (who are providing scholarship to 28 village school students) asked me to interact with a group of juniors who have a common origin (one coaching institute in Andhra Pradesh) and one common desire to serve the community. Their motivation comes from one teacher of the coaching institute, Mr. SVK who has started a 'movement' called VR1, ‘We are One’. There are about 100-150 such students in campus. Met the students one evening in Math Dept. seminar room. They inquired about service opportunities existing in the neighbourhood of the campus. I shared my experience with them and also some of the issues a new comers face in the IIT environment. Getting into IIT usually is the single minded pursuit before coming here. Hardly one thinks what next once one is in IIT. The IIT-JEE pressure has been released, parental control not in sight, freedom coupled with high speed internet, volumes of materials available in LAN and of different kind, peer pressure etc. there is good enough a recipe to get lost in the web. If one is concerned about community, one has to feel more responsible to acquire knowledge and power so that there is a larger capacity to serve. So the first step is not to get spoilt and to have an all round development of self, evolving as a better human being. Then one has to understand what is service. One definition says, it is kindness put into action. Both the words – ‘kindness’ and ‘action’ are important. Often there is a lot of action but without feelings for the community, without any sympathy – empathy is a harder call. Where from sympathy comes? What is the philosophy behind? Next, often a lot of kind people are seen with a desire to help the underprivileged. But they find it difficult to reach out, stand by their side under treacherous sun or in a muddy road, issues like availability of time or potential ‘side-effect’ creeps into mind. The action part remains missing or at most turns out to be donation to others who are in action (NGOs) – a kind of outsourcing the responsibility. Each of them in isolation serves some purpose but together they have the desired effect.VR1 organized one workshop and it was great to have a one-to-one meeting with the founder Mr. SVK. He appeared to be both inspiration and perspiration put into one. Wish his effort the very best. I placed some of my observations on VR1 before him. Next day was a Sunday when he conducted a workshop here on leadership and other issues. YES+ will be conducting ‘Arts of Living’ workshop in next two weekends. Two students came to my office a few days back and they want a workshop by sisters of Brahmakumaris here. I have listened to discourses of Sister Shivani in television and it is very inspiring, practical and logical. This is also expected very soon. Besides these we are having weekly lecture on spiritual heritage by senior monks of Ramakrishna Mission (every Wednesday at Gargi auditorium). Therefore, there is ample opportunity now. More importantly, that such things are there shows an increasing level of awareness or takers amongst us.InterviewOne mail came to me via a final year student who maintained our NSS group’s website 3 year’s back when I was a program officer looking after a small group. This was from Youth Leader Magazine, India a United Nations project with four UNESCO status. The magazine wants to publish interviews of a few NSS volunteers. The aim is to motivate and inspire the young generation for a positive and healthier life and to train them to develop into more social and environmental conscious adults. I nominated two of the NSS volunteers who received ‘Best Volunteer’ award in Youth Week function. The interview is done and waiting for its publication date. This will motivate young IIT students engaged in community service quite a lot. I was told that the correspondent replied like these after the interview, “It is great to see NSS and it's students doing so much for the betterment of the community and self. Your experience will be a motivating story for our readers.”I myself too was interviewed a few days back by a leading Indian newspaper on one of our research work. The photoshoot is scheduled next TUE. Shall inform readers about the article when it comes up in the daily. Earlier I had opportunity to interact with a few journalists. Interacted closely last December with the author when this article (Link) on Dr. Kalam’s visit to IIT Khargpur took place and I was the organizing secretary. I am told by our Head of the Dept. that I won’t be spared :-) in upcoming Diamond Jubilee program.Demo 2The students in the Signals & Systems course performed 2nd mini-project demo a week back. This was on speech recognition. It worked for two words for most of them and more than two for a few. About ten of them participated. None from girls this time. There were a few new developers who was not there for the first. The highest correlation in code was self-certified as 0.2. The final one is awaited on 9th April. This challenge is on developing automatic speaker recognition system again with minimum user base.The twin pillars of our research group are 'learning to learn' and 'team work'. We use technology profusely - googlegroup, chat, circulating PPT among the team before any presentation etc. (still there is room to improve). The aim is to make everybody independent as well as a team person, confident as well as humble. Trying to the extent possible, to give these 4th sem. students a feel of it. Shall see if it worked.SacrificeSomething very interesting happened on publication which shows how strong our team is and the quality of bonding amongst us. One ex-scholar of IITkgp (in one of our area of interest but not from our lab.) was coming up with an edited volume from a foreign publisher and on his request one of my ex-scholar and myself put up one chapter. Took 9-10 months to prepare that. Few weeks back we received the agreement form when deadline of publication came very very close. IIT Kharagpur had some objection there in the liability clause. I made suggestion on how it can be rewritten that takes care of the interest of editors, publishers as well as authors. The editors said that the agreement cannot be reworked and there is time pressure. My ex-student was comfortable with the liability clause and signed as principal author and sent the agreement. I came as co-author and the liability was not assigned to me. Now came an issue if such exclusion would be acceptable to the publisher. We (me and the editors) then agreed that my student will come as single author and my name will be excluded to save the chapter. We wanted the work to be there which editors found very well written and informative. In fact, the Ph.D. thesis of this student of mine earned huge appreciation from both the examiners and the foreign examiner, a senior faculty in a foreign university remarked as ‘best thesis read’. And 9-10 months hard work was at stake. We conveyed the same to my student. I kind of convinced him in the evening. Next morning I get a mail which says “I thought very sanely yesterday night about this matter and found that it will not be good if YOU are not there with me as an author …”. The same was communicated to editors and we are waiting for their decision. Don’t know if we are acting like idiots on this count. Enjoying the holiday and watching ‘3 Idiots’ in Sony channel televised as Holy special. To us, the eternal optimists, \"Ell\" is always well. Ours is to work."},

{"title": "Wonderful People", "date": "Sunday, February 6, 2011", "text": "Met some wonderful people yesterday, a Sunday. In the morning, Uttamda was at our residence. Uttamda, one of my inspiration from childhood is more than a Vivekananda scholar. A great organizer, master of time management, he ran a series of article titled \"What we can do\" in our magazine named \"Unmochan\". They were truly gem and I wish they are made available to every young person. Great to see Uttamda after a long time who is now teaching Higher Secondary students at Chittaranjan Railway School. Uttamda asked when I am going to upload the ABVYM Annual Camp 2010 pics. It is not yet there in ABVYM website. A team from IITkgp that had three NSS officers, spent one afternoon there. Few pics are available here.Next, rushed to CEC community hall at about 12:30 p.m. There was a one day program arranged by Vivekananda Study Circle which runs a weekly study circle at F-127, Institute Main Building every Tuesday from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. and has taken up developmental work in a nearby tribal village, named Soladahar. Chiranjeev Maharaj from Deoghar centre of Ramakrishna Mission came along with Dipak Maharaj and others. Chiranjeev Maharaj came several times before and inspires this group a lot. There was reading from Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, song, Q & A, presentation of work carried out by study circle. It was great to see young study circle members doing work so sincerely where work is treated as worship.As soon as this meet ended, arrived at Kalidas Auditorium at quarter to five. There was a TEDx event on \"Ideas worth spreading\". Announced in NSS bulletin board .. if we get some idea here for NSS, IIT Kharagpur to pursue. The event started at 3 p.m. and I missed nearly the entire first half. The speakers were talking in turn and taking Q&A from audience. Five lucky persons asking questions would get an opportunity to dine with the eminent speakers. This I highlight for some special reason. Our favourite in Signals & Systems class, Gopich.. was one of the lucky five. We congratulated him when his name was announced. He was quite surprised but I as an instructor of the class was not, having faced volley of questions from him, class after class :-) since January beginning. Gopi, are you listening?  Coming back to the TED event, it was great to hear Dr. P. Anandan of Microsoft, Srinivas Mohan, Visual Effects Director, our own student Manoj Mandelia who is turning innovation to start-up, Ashutosh & Swapnil duo of Tata Jagriti. While all spoke very well about the work they are doing, somehow I failed to connect with the theme of the conference \"Ideas worth spreading\". However, Srinivas Mohan briefly touched his life's journey, the struggle towards excellence for a  college drop out. It was truly inspiring. I was looking for his biography in the net. All I get his work but not him. The presentation by Swapnil & Ashutosh brought out what they wanted to tell about Jagriti Yatra in a very, very professional manner. It talked about outlay and not much about outcome. Probably, time was short and it needs some more time to see the outcome. All in all, it was nice to be with these set of wonderful people through out the day. I was honoured to be called by the organizers to hand over mementos to these distinguished speakers at the end of the function together with another professor. Pics of this Sunday and another wonderful Sunday in January, 2011 at my old place of work can be found here.Here, I got the second referral of 2011, 'Senior Professor' during my introduction to the stage. This follows 'Active Blogger' of IEEE Techsym. While the first connect me to the older generation, the second one with the younger ones. Remember the dilemma in one Amul Advertizement : I am too old for something, too young for something else, but right for Amul Milk Chocolate. Till then let me cherish life, the delicious!"},

{"title": "Cell Phone Hazard", "date": "Wednesday, February 2, 2011", "text": "Last month one of our relative sought an opinion from me. He has been approached for setting up of a cell phone tower at roof top. The monthly rent to be paid to him is significant. I wish I could tell him what he wanted to hear - a \"Yes\". But I could not. Besides the structural integrity of the old building in which the tower will be raised there is the concern of associated health risk.The health risk associated with cell phone use and cell phone towers, the points and counter points made, are often equated with the ones made on cigarette smoking few years back. And we know where we stand now. The industries who make money out of it kept saying, \"There is no conclusive evidence to link the two.\" The report titled \"Electromagnetic fields and public health : mobile phones\" published by World Health Organization in May, 2010 says, \"To date, no adverse health effects have been established for mobile phone use.\" Such statements can be read in both ways. It always leaves a hint of doubt : There may be or there are 'adverse health effects' but not established as yet.In a 2002 report published by Karen J Rogers titled \"Health effects from cell phone tower radiation\" cautions people. The author cites several references like [1]Microwave and Radio Frequency Radiation Exposure, San Francisco Medicine , Vol. 74, No 3, March 2001 [2]Mobiles Risk to children, Daily Mail (U.K.), May 11, 2000 etc. and and to quote a few paragraphs from page 1 of his reportStudies have shown that even at low levels of this radiation, there is evidence of damage to cell tissue and DNA, and it has been linked to brain tumors, cancer, suppressed immune function, depression, miscarriage, Alzheimer's disease, and numerous other serious illnesses. [1]Children are at the greatest risk, due to their thinner skulls, and rapid rate of growth. Also at greater risk are the elderly, the frail, and pregnant women. Doctors from the United Kingdom have issued warnings urging children under 16 not to use cell phones, to reduce their exposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation. [2]Over 100 physicians and scientists at Harvard and Boston University Schools of Public Health have called cellular towers a radiation hazard. And, 33 delegate physicians from 7 countries have declared cell phone towers a “public health emergency.” The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in charge of setting the standards of exposure for the public, and claims that, based on scientific studies, the current levels are safe. But it is not a public health agency, and has been criticized as being “an arm of the industry”. Many who work for the FCC are either past, present or future employees of the very industries they are supposed to regulate. With an explosively emergent $40 billion dollar a year industry at stake, critics have stated “you can bet that their studies are going to show whatever they want them to show”.Back home, Prof. Girish Kumar of IIT Bombay has been working with arduous tenacity to make people aware. He prepared a comprehensive \"Report on Cell Tower Radiation\" which is full of case studies and circulated widely. We received it in our mailbox some time back and this as well as the Rogers' report mentioned above are available in full at scribd. Prof. Kumar has explained it nicely with radiation beam pattern etc. and to quote from his reportThrough the help of the above typical radiation pattern, let’s analyze the news reported in Mid-day, Mumbai dated Jan. 3, 2010, which stated -“Mumbai's swanky Usha Kiran building says the four cancer cases there could be linked to mobile towers installed on the facing Vijay Apartments”. The picture taken from the Usha Kiran building of the several antennas installed onthe seventh floor of Vijay Apartments is shown in Fig. 2. People living in the 6th, 7th and 8th floor in the opposite building will get maximum radiation as they are in the main beam direction. People living on the other floors will receive lesser radiation as beam maxima is reduced considerably as can be observed from vertical radiation pattern. In the horizontal direction again, people living in the front side of the antenna will receive much higher radiation compared to people living in the back side of antenna.NDTV published Prof. Kumar's view on June 26, 2010 which stated like this.\"Each antenna is transmitting with a gain of approximately 50, so we are  looking at 4-5 kilowatts of power being transmitted by these antennas.  Microwaves use only 500 watts of power and that too you cook food for  just a few minutes. These towers are transmitting 24 hours so you are  absorbing radiation 24 hours. The solution is that cell phone towers  should transmit one tenth of the power they are currently transmitting,\"DNA publishes this on Jan. 30, 2010.Dr RS Sharma of the Indian Council of Medical Research said that the  government of India was among the countries that had adopted the worst  standards of radiation levels. Today we find some action at Govt. end. Times of India today carried the following as a front page news.Radiation from mobile  phones and towers poses serious health risks, including memory loss,  lack of concentration, disturbance in the digestive system and sleep  disturbances, according to an inter-ministerial committee formed by the  ministry of communications and information technology to study the  hazards posed by mobile phones.     The committee has also  attributed disappearance of butterflies, bees, insects and sparrows from  big cities to mobile phone-related radiation. Member scientist, ICMR,  R S Sharma said compared to Europeans, Indian cellphone users are more  at risk for adverse affect of radiation due to the country’s hot  tropical climate, low body mass index, and low fat content.\"In the case of a person  using a cellphone, most of the heating occurs on the surface of the  head, causing its temperature to increase by a fraction of a degree. The  brain blood flow is capable of disposing this excess by increasing the  local blood flow and increasing body temperature,\" states the report. It  says that the non-thermal effects of cellphone use — attributed to the  induced electromagnetic effects inside the body's biological cells — are  more harmful. \"There is a 400% increase  in the risk of brain cancer among teenagers using cell phones for long  periods. The younger the child, the deeper is the penetration of  electromagnetic radiation as children`s skulls are thinner. Another government-funded study on radiation from mobile phones and towers at the Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU)  found that the exposure to radiation from mobile towers and mobile  phones could have an adverse impact on male fertility and pose health  hazards by depleting the defence mechanism of cells.  Whether we consider cell phone as necessary evil or not, we may try to limit its use to the extent possible and develop a collective opinion so that common man who do not read all these reports, can avoid health hazard. It is a collective responsibility for all of us who appreciate the underlying issues.Links:http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/  http://www.scribd.com/doc/3773284/Health-Effects-from-Cell-Phone-Tower-Radiation http://www.scribd.com/doc/44736879/Cell-Tower-Radiation-Report-sent-to-DOT-Department-of-Telecommunications http://www.ndtv.com/article/sci-tech/is-cell-phone-radiation-a-health-hazard-33943http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_citizens-ensure-warnings-on-cell-radiation-are-taken-seriously-in-mumbai_1500686http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Mobiles-pose-health-risk-says-govt-panel/articleshow/7415288.cms"},
{"title": "Biometric", "date": "Tuesday, February 1, 2011", "text": "There is a reason to get interested in this article from rediff. It brings that 'I said so' smile in your face, not exactly sadistic though. It is more like getting an agreement from the community which is important for us to make development in a complementary technology space. It is useful for funding research, answering reviewers, keeping faith etc.We work on certain area of biometric signature generation which is anything but fingerprint. We leave retina scan out of this because it is cumbersome and costly. The critic finds faults with us citing 'finger-print' based systems are a kind of full proof as finger print is 'unique'. While they accept that ours is easy to use and has much, much wider applicability, the percentage accuracy were always doubted or looked down upon vis-a-vis finger print based system. Almost all the points made in this article used to be cited by us but such reports by a lead media house help in developing a general agreement.It is some time to have our developments available commercially but there are a lot of groups world wide pursuing that space and hope to have something in near future. Now excerpts from the Rediff article available with a video demo at http://www.rediff.com/news/report/fool-proof-uid-system-for-indians-blah/20110201.htm :However, we wish the finger print based system developer very best so that they come up with a more robust system. Competition helps all and the solution may lie in multi modal system i.e. considering more than one mode : finger print is one and what we do, could be the other. ------In a demonstration, an electronic systems  expert specialising in biometrics exposed the gaping hole in the  assumption that a fingerprint is a secure way to identify individuals.  It would cost less than a dollar -- Rs 30 to be exact -- to fool the  system, according to J T D'souza, managing director of Sparc Systems  Limited. \"...all one needs is wax, a small dish and a small tube of fevicol. ...making a finger print impression without the knowledge of the person is relatively expensive. It costs Rs 250.\" He used a thin layer of skin-like substance which has  the impression of his wife's fingerprint on his hand and moistens it  with his breath. This fooled the system.He explained that finger prints from the  individuals are stored as images, from which the coordinates of several  points on the ridges and valleys of the finger are recorded. \"Each  attempt to record the fingerprint on the scanner may yield different  images owing to the amount of pressure applied and the moisture.  Moreover, ridges and valleys on the fingerprint may be altered by years  of hard labour.Authorities in South Korea, which has the  most extensive use of the biometric system, noted that in Seoul, the  fingerprint of each person underwent progressive deterioration over a  period of 1.5 years for over 50 percent of the individuals sampled, said  D'souza. \"Even forensic science experts can't  confirm 100 per cent that two fingerprints are from the same person. A study on the fingerprint database of  the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed that a single query may  throw up possible matches ranging between 5 and 50000.\"Contrary to popular belief,  fingerprints are neither unique and nor does it remain the same for an  individual over a period of time,\" said D'souza."},
{"title": "A Converstaion plus Flat Rate Follow Up", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2011", "text": "There was a long chat on google with a student on THU evening 9:30-10:30 p.m. who was asking for N.S.S. support to some proposed activity in the campus. Besides the short notice period, the activity did not fit into N.S.S. mandate. The next evening, the student came to my office at about 7:00 p.m. and we had an interesting discussion with a ground rule that could not be anything better. We are entitled to have our own opinions while we respect each others'. We share what we learnt from our reading of life but no bulldozing of thoughts, giving time and space to each other to learn from one's own experience. Some of the points I raised were:1. No blame game. A blames B, B blames C, .... the cycle goes on. Let us do what we can do and lead by examples. The more we do, the more is the increase in our capacity.2. No policy, no welfare scheme, no manifesto is bad. All speak of upliftment of people. What is needed is proper execution. The execution is again done by people.3. \"Make men first. Everything else will be ready ..... we need man-making character building education\", said Vivekananda. The more we empower people (through higher education etc.), the more is our responsibility to see that they come up as a better human being with love for fellow being (this power is to be used for the good of all).4. The inverse of 2nd part of point 3 is also true. The more we feel ourselves responsible for the community, the more we should give effort to elevate ourselves to a position which helps us to deliver greater good. If I am a student, I should not be satisfied with a lower percentage of marks or a poor career.5. If we address the symptoms and not the disease, then the problem will resurface in another form in another place. It is more like taking the dust from my door to my neighbour's door.6. Means and end both should be noble. A noble end cannot be achieved by tricks or by means which is uncorrelated from the end. All prophets talked about imbibing spirit of service, sacrifice, following the path of truth and love.7. All of us have the potential of becoming Buddha, Christ. Vivekananda says, \"If you cannot become Buddha, Christ then they never existed.\"8. We were and are never short of ideals in any era. There are always example before us - good people doing good deeds. We need to read those lives and draw inspiration, develop a positive attitude.9. Again Vivekananda who says, \"Purity, patience, perseverance are three essentials to success, and above all, love.\"Today Economic Times (ET) ran a front page story on micro finance companies who started as NGO (not for profit), then converted to NBFC (for profit) where underprivileged were included through MBT (Mutual Benefit Trust) and finally elbowed out from the company which is now completely owned by promoters. This article is aptly titled 'Uplifting promoters in the name of downtrodden'.It says, \"An ET investigation shows  45,000 women who were shareholders in the country’s top three  microfinance companies have missed out on the benefits of wealth  creation—some due to transactions engineered by promoters, some due to  the structure used to house shares owned by the poor.          \"ET followed it up with a detailed report inside on three companies which is titled \"The Poor as Puppets\".Excerpts from it goes like this.  \"IN THE 2004-05 ANNUAL REPORT of Share  Microfin, promoter and managing director M Udaia Kumar proudly  declared: “Most of the shares are held by poor women who are part of the  microfinance programme implemented by the company for poverty reduction  and livelihood promotion, except the initial promoters and their  relatives holding 0.97%. The company is striving to remain a  community-based, mutual-benefit financial company.”     Within two  years of that proud declaration, there was little “community-based” or  “mutual benefit” about Share Microfin. As on March 31, 2007, promoters,  associates and employees, led by Kumar, owned 98%, having bought all the  shares held by the poor women, which were housed in mutual benefit  trusts, or MBTs (The story on Page 1 explains their working.)   About the time the promoters finished  taking control of the company also marked a breakout point for the  business. Between 2006-07 and 2009-10, revenues of Share Microfin  increased from Rs 62.9 crore to Rs 475.3 crore—a compounded annual  growth rate (CAGR) of 96%. Net profit increased from Rs 1 crore to 108.7  crore—a CAGR of 372%. In other words, the poor women bore the risk  during the building phase of the business. But it was the promoters who  reaped the rewards from the business taking off. \"An IIM-Ahmedabad faculty member helped in the research.We had a discussion on this before at http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2010/10/flat-rate.html One can find a correlation between first conversation and the flat rate story. It is time that we address the root cause and not play around the bushes."},
{"title": "Demo", "date": "Friday, January 28, 2011", "text": "We asked all the presenters to be available at 8:15 a.m., 15 min. before the actual class starts. This was the 4th Week of the Signals & Systems Course. The task was to develop a real-time voice based gender recognition system as a part of mini student projects. We had 12 systems ready for demo, 2 from girl students and 10 from boys - a ratio in favour of the girls compared to their presence in the class. Since it was a gender recognition system, I am trying to give a gender based performance stat. too. Hope to generate some competitive spirit!We decided to put the same set of boys and girls for trial of each prototype. Since these were laptop based systems, its screen was made visible in a large screen format for the entire class of 90 students. What followed was a great experience! Six of the twelve systems got it 100 percent correct. Each time the developer got huge applause from fellow students. Whenever there was a failure, out came an 'Ohh!' from the class as if one Indian batsman got out in a crucial moment of a cricket match. The developers and the rest of the class as audience,  all deserve appreciation. (pics of this great class of Signals & Systems ECE 2011 is attached : addition of a new pic at top - why should great ECE batch of 1990 be missed! I am somewhere there. This completes all characters of yesterday's class, me included and as a student like others...but who among that group of 29?)There were moments of fun, too. Gopich... was getting frustrated when few consecutive trials in not-fully-perfect systems detected him as 'female'. Then he started submitting phrases like \"I am male\" or \"Cheeka-Cheeeka\". The prosody of Debolee...'s speech on some occasions (Hi  [Developer], I am ..) was such that the developer would have not written another piece of code, if the system erred (I am joking!). Quite a few systems failed to recognize Pava... as human being, something developers decided to put as an output if input is anything but speech!!!As a whole, it was a nice experience. For the statisticians, both the demo from girl students were 100 percent correct while 4 of the 10 demo from boys came unscathed. Does the same  persist in other fields too? There is something positive for boys here, more number of them dared to come forward and subjected their systems (themselves ?) to trial which always had a probability of failure.Never mind failures. It is important to make attempts and also to learn how to handle failures, if it is there. Fear of failure is something which needs to be overcome.Level 2 description of the system level development task has been published. (i)To make this system robust against noise. For applications like gender based suggestion of content, one may not experience any attack. However, applications like automated voice based toilet (male / female) door lock system one has to consider impostor attacks (male trying to speak like female). (ii)Speech recognition based real-time application (limited vocabulary). Deadline is extended to 10th Feb. as asked by the students.Took the opportunity to make a quick 5 min. presentation on IP generation, patent search, patent filing, patent defence. Gave one demo of a patent defence from our research group. This we had presented before experts the previous day and the PPT was at my desktop along with lecture slides. Wished that the students who have completed only 1.5 year here and 2.5 year (4-year program) / 3.5 year (5-year program) to go, can have some innovations in their portfolio when they leave IIT kharagpur.Waiting for another round of fun-filled demo session and expect wider participation that time with larger number of students coming to the front as developers. Meanwhile theory, application, tutorial, MATLAB .... will continue."},

Now I will have to start thinking about what to do for myself.” Thus says Girish Paranjpe, ousted joint-CEO of Wipro, a USD 6 billion company in DNA. None can miss in his statement, the hollowness created, due to sudden withdrawal of the responsibility. It also perhaps brings out emptiness of certain aspect of life which we consider even larger than life itself.People were sceptical in the first place itself when Wipro floated two CEO theory 3 year back and experienced Girish was picked up as one of them. While TCS was ahead of the race, Infosys had already replaced Wipro in no. 2 position and was increasing the gap. The resignation (was not shown the door) of Vivek Paul made Premji, 80% share holder, double his role as Chairman and CEO for 3 years. Following this, he picked up two CEOs. Yesterday he announced that he is replacing 2 CEOs with a new single CEO. The reason cited : growth rate is much lower than peers. Analysts say, it is the threat of Cognizant replacing them as no. 3 in IT sector in near future. According to a theory, if one is not in top 3, then one is out.My interest here in developments within Wipro is not from the point of an insignificantly small  share holding I have in the company or as someone who had some initial discussion with them on one of our innovation and see scope of collaboration with its healthcare wing (you never know!); but as a reader of life who reads parting statement of an erstwhile CEO, making an unceremonious exit.Like him, many of us are busy in pursuit of or caring certain things of life for days, weeks, months and years and not life itself. Incidents like these remind us the message Sri Ramakrishna left in some of his parables.He asks us to lead life like a maid in a rich employer's house who raises up kids there; sings songs for them, even go up to tell \"My XYZ (the employer's son) has done this today.\" But she knows very well  that she has to go back at the end of the day to her own home and care  her own children. That is her real state and this stay at employer's big  house and in all luxury is all but temporary.The image uploaded here can be zoomed for reading comfort. This is an inspiring speech by Wipro Chairman Azim Premji on his lessons in life. This is full of short anecdotes and leaves an enriching experience.Together it strikes a balance. Passion and detachment. Intense activity in intense rest and intense rest in intense activity. The essence of Karmayoga .....---------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is taken from page 83 of \"Tales and Parables of Sri  Ramakrishna\" that can be found at  http://www.scribd.com/doc/29396382/Tales-Parables-of-Sri-Rama-Krishna-CompleteA certain traveller came to a large plain in the course of his travels. As he had been walking in the sun for many hours, he was thoroughly exhausted and heavily perspiring; so he sat down in the shade of a tree to rest a little. Presently he began to think what a comfort it would be if he could but get a soft bed there to sleep on.   He was not aware that he was sitting under the celestial tree. As soon as the above thought rose in his mind, he found a nice bed by his side. He felt much astonished, but all the same stretched himself on it. Now he thought to himself, how pleasant it would be, were a young damsel to come there and gently stroke his legs. No sooner did the thought arise  in his mind than he found a young damsel sitting at his feet and stroking his legs. The traveller felt supremely happy. Presently he felt hungry and thought: \"I have got whatever I have wished for; could I not then get some food?\" Instantly he found various kinds of delicious food spread before him. He at once fell to eating, and having helped himself to his heart's content, stretched himself again on his bed. He now began to revolve in his mind the events of the day. While thus occupied, he thought: \"If a tiger should attack me all of a sudden!\" In an instant a large tiger jumped on him and broke his neck and began to drink his blood. In this way the traveller lost his life.Such is the fate of men in general.   If during your meditation you pray for men or money   or worldly honours, your desires will no doubt be satisfied to some  extent; but, mind you, there is the dread of the tiger  behind the gifts you get. Those tigers—disease,  bereavements, loss of honour and wealth etc.,—are a thousand times more terrible than the live tiger."},

I often listen to her with a sense of dis-belief! Only a few days back I had to explain her almost everything, hundreds of those questions. How quickly a child grows and imperceptibly, while being in front of your eyes all the time!Yesterday afternoon I saw another child surprising me standing up to many, many year seniors. It was the start of the afternoon session on Machine Intelligence & Pattern Recognition of IEEE TechSym 2011, a student symposium at IIT Kharagpur. As a session chair I also had the responsibility of introducing keynote speaker Dr. Ravi Kothari of IBM Research. I was having a talk with him in the sideline when Technical Program Committee Chair started introducing me to the participants. The standard stuffs - I did this and that in professional field and there I heard newest bullet in my resume 'active blogger'.Frankly speaking, I was ready up to 'NSS Coordinator' as a lot of my colleagues, senior people in admin., students, guardians, alumni interact with me on that identity. A total of 14 officers, 900 student volunteers, many different activities round the year, not that unusual to be known by that.(The recent updates from NSS IIT Kharagpur are here.http://picasaweb.google.com/gsaha.iitkgp/YouthDay12thJan2011#http://picasaweb.google.com/gsaha.iitkgp/YouthWeekRally15thJan2011#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g8ILbQAUkcOn 19th Jan. we are having concluding function of National Youth Week at  Kalidas Auditorium where inter village school (13 of them) competition  drawings will be displayed, prizes will be handed over to invited school  teachers. Also there will be panel discussion, Address by dignitaries  and cultural program by NSS volunteers.)But the identity as an 'active blogger' and in a situation like that was a pack full of bewilderment. True that occasionally I get mail, comments on posts but that is too infrequent. It appears that there are silent readers, at least I did not expect TPC Chair of TechSym to have taken note of this space.Thank you readers. Comments or no comments - it is great to feel that we strike a common chord somewhere.----Visited NIT Rourkella for the first time on 8-9th Jan., 2011 at Samit's call. Samit, my 2nd Ph.D. student is a faculty member there. Beautifully organized conference, in all aspect. Loved it. On 6th Jan., visited another conference at IEM, Kolkata and met many old pals. It was walking down the memory lane. A lot of people have moved. There was no dearth of love and affection from those who was still there. Prepared PhD Admission Test Q. Paper for some place the previous week but politely declined to visit that place as it was becoming too hectic. Expecting a Delhi visit for one project or the other soon. Vodafone project's quarterly review report was submitted yesterday. Finalizing the manuscript of a book chapter (edited volume on speech processing) with Sandipan, my first Ph.D. student who is the main author. Yesterday evening, organizer of a Tech Fest requested display of one of our prized (literally) innovation \"Heart Sound Analyzer\". In India Telecom Exhibition at Pragati Maidan, Delhi we displayed it in Dec., 2008. This time (Dec., 2010) there our speech group displayed \"Automatic Speaker Recognition\" working prototype. Patent filing of \"Lung Sound Analyzer\" is to be completed within 2 weeks. Got a letter from the publisher that they are contemplating on converting the published titles to ebook. In 2010, two books returned almost similar volume of 2009, about 40,000. Waiting for a call from the US parent on US edition. The bulk of the work is already done. Reviews of this new edition from US university Prof.s are very good. The remaining work is simple but tedious and time consuming. Need to devote a large percentage of time when that call comes. That is the update as of now. Yes, the new batch of 2nd year students in theory class appear to be serious. Enjoying the interaction. Need more time to develop an opinion about Lab. & Seminar classes."},

The fun element of a metro reader vanishes when the reality of a suburban fringe comes to the fore. A supreme court women judge listing two daughters among 'liabilities' may raise eyebrows. The reason cited : \"two daughters to be married\". One may question whether a Delhi based SC judge who belong to an enlightened strata of the society should feel that way. But we are never wise enough to know the ground realities. This reality makes a bright class XI girl from a poor farmer family give private tutions to support her study and stand on her own feet. Yes, local residents adored this teen for her determination to 'stay in school in spite of the odds'.Yesterday, on her way home after giving tution she was abducted, raped and then murdered.Let not simply a pal of gloom, or feelings of helplessness sink in us. Let us ask ourselves :Are we, who can, doing enough to change such realities? Do we have a desire to do something? Or do we consider it is a liability on our 'over-burdened' lives to take note of such realities that may take our attention away and we may miss a few career milestones?------BARASAT HORROR Schoolgirl raped, killed TIMES NEWS NETWORK  29.12.2010Barasat:  A 17-year-old schoolgirl was raped and murdered at Dadpur, some 45km  from Kolkata, on Monday night. The victim, who used to give tuitions to  manage her school fees, was abducted on her way home, raped in a field  and strangled.  The body was found at 6.30am on Tuesday. When  police arrived at the spot, they were gheraoed by a mob. Local  residents, who were very fond of the girl for her determination to stay  in school in spite of the odds, accused police of not acting tough on  criminals and allowing goons a free run.   The  victim was a Class XI student of Dadpur Girl’s High School and  regularly gave tuitions to support the family. She left home around 6pm  on Monday. When she did not return by 10pm, her parents got worried. Her cellphone was switched off. The family lodged a missing person’s complaint.  “Preliminary investigation says she was raped and strangled. We will track down the culprits,” a police officer said.  Her father, a farmer, is shattered. “She was the light of our lives. She was a very good student and we had struggled very hard to keep he in school,” he said. SC woman judge lists daughters as ‘liabilities’ TIMES NEWS NETWORK  29.12.2010New  Delhi: It is a line that even Bollywood has banished for a while now.  But while declaring her assets and liabilities, sitting Supreme Court  judge Gyan Sudha Mishra has listed the marriage of her two daughters in  the “liabilities” column, apparently without considering anything to be  much amiss.  The Supreme Court’s official website in its assets of sitting judges column gives Justice Mishra’s  declaration in which she lists “two daughters to be married” in the  liabilities column. This might be a sentiment still shared by a section  of the middle class, but could be regarded as politically incorrect,  especially on the part of India’s senior-most woman judge.  Other  entries in the liabilities column are “guarantor for education loan of  my daughter” and residential house to be built post-retirement. The view  that daughters are a “liability” (often  because of the high cost of their marriage), or a burden of some sort,  is a notion the government is fighting to eradicate through campaigns.  The declaration is likely to attract comment as it is does not seem in  sync with the Supreme Court’s otherwise progressive image on social  issues in general and women’s rights in particular.  It could be seen to be betraying a thinking on which the Supreme Court is often called to deliberate while handling sensitive gender parity cases.  The  assets of Justice Mishra, who formerly headed the Chhattisgarh high  court, has declared are not out of the ordinary. “Stridhan” of one gold  set and “few gold rings and a pair of bangles” are listed under  jewellery. There are no shares or mutual funds and fixed deposits total  just 5 lakh."},
{"title": "CSR : Percentage Debate", "date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2010", "text": "Neither voluntary, nor mandatory, somewhere in between! We are in a battle of brains. The debate is turning interesting. While Govt. clearly wants Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) be in place in letter and spirit, it is giving space to corporate houses to align itself to new realities. Minister of Corporate Affairs is categorical in his statement, “There can be business  without charity. There can be charity without business. But there can be  no business without orporate social responsibility.” He removes the fuzziness about CSR in saying, \"To say that you will protect your labour force with proper equipment and proper clothing is not CSR, but giving people of the  area similar equipment because they are living in an inherently  dangerous area may be corporate social responsibility.\"Now comes the percentage debate. The reaction from corporate bodies are interesting. Reproducing it from today's ET.Govt won’t set CSR floor for India Inc Firms Won’t Need To Spend 2% Of Profit Souvik Sanyal & Deepshikha SikarwarNEW DELHI     THE  government has watered down its proposal on corporate social  responsibility (CSR) by not including a provision in the Companies Bill  that would have mandated firms to spend 2% of their profit on social  causes.    The final proposal only requires a company to have a  policy that targets to spend 2% of its profit on CSR. The bill, however,  seeks to make it compulsory for a company to give details of the money  it has spent on CSR in its annual report.    “Companies will have  to have a policy as to how they will spend 2% of their profit on CSR and  there must be a disclosure if the money has been spent,” Corporate  Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid told ET. “You can say it is not  entirely voluntary, might say it is not mandatory. It is in between somewhere.”    The  proposal is a dilution of the government’s stance before the  Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance that it was considering  making the CSR spend mandatory.    The government had suggested  that it could ask companies having a minimum net worth of 500 crore, or  an annual turnover of 1,000 crore, or a net profit of 5 crore in a year  to spend at least 2% of their average net profit during the three  preceding fiscals on CSR.    While the general view is that  companies would welcome a dilution in the government’s stance, some in  the corporate world say there is actually no dilution.“This is mandating  a 2% CSR spend without actually mandating it,” the representative of an  industry body said. CII for voluntary CSR spend “How can a company declare in its annual report it has not spent on corporate social responsibility?”    In  a presentation to the government, the Confederation of Indian Industry  had demanded that the new law should not specify an amount to be spent  on CSR, and that a decision on the actual spend be left to company  boards. The industry body had suggested that CSR should be voluntary and  backed by a system of state recognition and honour. Khurshid said the  government could give incentives to companies at some stage.    “There  are no built-in incentives... But let’s see, in future we may look at  some incentives,” he said adding that his ministry was still working on  the idea of CSR credits and their trading.    The actual spend of  most companies on CSR is well below the 2% threshold, and much of it  would not be considered if a strict definition is applied.     But  central public sector enterprises have a policy that requires them to  spend 0.5-5% of their net profit on CSR activities.    The minister  said he was not in favour of linking CSR to a company’s area of  operation. “To say that you will protect your labour force with proper  equipment and proper clothing is not CSR,” he said. “But  giving people of the area similar equipment because they are living in  an inherently dangerous area may be orporate social responsibility.”    “You  have to draw a line between charity, philanthropy and CSR,” Khurshid  said. “There can be business without charity. There can be charity  without business. But there can be no business without orporate social  responsibility.”"},
{"title": "Majorana Returns", "date": "Sunday, December 19, 2010", "text": "This was the title of a Nature article in describing renewed interest in the work of Ettore Majorana, a prodigy who made a sudden disappearance when he was only 32 years old. In Fermi's team he pocketed all the prize money whenever a bet was fixed on solution to a scientific problem. However, paper writing, publishing appeared unexciting to him and at least two of his ideas won Nobel prizes later and he was not credited with. B. R. Holstein in his review writes,\"Majorana was a reluctant author. Once he discovered something he considered his own work to be banal. Once a problem was solved Majorana was very reluctant to write anything up on it. An example was the discovery of the neutron. Work by Joliot and Curie in France discovered a neutral particle that can enter matter and expel a proton. their conclusion was that it must be a photon, because at the time it was the only know particle with no charge. Majorana saw immediately that it must be a particle with a mass near that of the proton, in order to move something as heavy as the proton. When he heard this, Fermi urged him to write it up immediately, but nothing happened and soon thereafter Chadwick was given the credit for discovery of the neutron for his work in berylium.\"The much talked about neutrino paper would not have seen the day, at least Majorana as author had not he needed a publication list for a position to support his application. This is the famous  paper on Neutrino work by Majorana, but was written by Fermi. There are only 9 publications against his name.In the words of Fermi, \"There are many categories of scientists, people of second and third  rank, who do their best, but do not go very far. There are also people  of first class, who make great discoveries, which are of capital  importance for the development of science. But then there are the  geniuses, like Galileo and Newton.  Well, Ettore was one of these. Majorana had greater gifts than anyone  else in the world; unfortunately he lacked one quality which other men  generally have: plain common sense.\"His disappearance is linked to many theories : spiritual quest, reluctance to be a part of nuclear weapon making group, suicide etc. On March 25, 1938 this is what he wrote to Director of his institute where he leaves a hint of this exit plan.Dear Carrelli, I made a decision that has become unavoidable. There isn't a bit of selfishness in it, but I realize what trouble my sudden disappearance will cause you and the students. For this as well, I beg your forgiveness, but especially for betraying the trust, the sincere friendship and the sympathy you gave me over the past months.

{"title": "Also Happens", "date": "Saturday, December 18, 2010", "text": "Don't know how to interpret it or the underlying dynamics. It need not be a comic aberration. There may be much much more than what the article tells.Beggar’s election as gram pradhan sparks debate Arvind Singh Bisht | TNN Dec. 19, 2010Lucknow:  Can a beggar hold a public office? The question hangs thick after  Narayan Nat, a 50-year-old beggar, has been elected as gram pradhan of  Sahawar Shah of Badaun district in the just concluded panchayat polls in  UP.    The issue has come under scrutiny as law prohibits begging.  It is a declared offence and deemed a social evil, both under the  Central and the UP Acts meant to discourage begging. This is thus argued  that begging is contrary to the morality, which is the essence of  democracy.    A debate over the issue holds views both in favour  and against Nat’s election. While the development is hailed by radicals  as a warning against corrupt politicians, traditionalist and jurists  disagree with this. They feel the issue needs to be given a serious thought,  as legitimising the malice of begging will only give way to similar  other immoral activities like immoral trafficking and gambling in the  public domain.    When asked to comment on the issue, DM, Banda,  Amit Gupta said: “Nat stands to be disqualified, if he does not give up  begging after assuming his post.” Section 92 of the UP Panchayat Act empowers DM to disqualify gram pradhan for any post-electoral misconduct.    However,  another side of the issue is that the election of Nat is seen as a rare  feat and a warning to the corrupt politicians. As put by UP Congress  legislature party leader, Pramod Tiwari: “Technically, Nat’s victory may  be incorrect because begging is punishable under the law, but  otherwise, his rise reflects the public mind and anger against  corruption, practised today by almost all the politicians.”    Reacting  sharply to this, C B Pandey, a retired judge and former advisor to the  UP governor, said that in spite of everything, begging couldn’t be  legitimised. He said that Nat should be disqualified. All the more  reason for this, he said, was that Nat in his public position had  proudly announced to continue begging."},

P. Nirajnayan, IG, Bengal CID, said the girl was “traumatised” and had been sent for medical examination.                                                                                Plucked away by a  gang  of traffickers, Yasmin’s story is testimony to the free run gangs  of traffickers enjoy in Bengal’s poverty-ridden villages.                                                                                 Yasmin would have  remained another piece of the cold statistics that say 2,500 teenaged  girls disappear from Bengal every year but for the combined efforts of  an unlikely group of people brought together by the persistence of her  stepmother Johora Bibi.‘I knew our daughter would come back’ Sumati Yengkhom | TNN Dec. 17, 2010Kolkata:  On April 15, 2009, Tahira Khatun had gone to a village fair — barely  200 metres from her home at Balikhal in Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas —  never to return. Her sisterin-law, Jasmira Biwi, returned home late in  the evening and told the family that she could not locate Tahira in the  crowd.The family launched a manhunt in the village that very  night. A few locals, such as Mohiuddin Biwi, told the family that they  had seen Tahira getting into a Maruti Omni around 10.30pm. They also  spotted one Kaus Mir and Anwar Bhangi (all from the locality) bundling  her into the vehicle, along with one Kashmira Biwi who is allegedly  involved in the flesh trade racket. Suspecting  that Tahira would be pushed into flesh trade, the girl’s father, Khater  Visti, filed a diary the next day with the Dholahat police and lodged a  complaint against six local residents, accusing them of kidnapping the  girl.When police failed to fetch any information on Tahira for  about two months, the family moved the Kakdwip ACJM court with a writ  petition in June. As no one in the family is literate,  they were being assisted by Rafique Ahmed Darjee, a lawyer’s clerk. At  the same time, the family knocked on the doors of senior police  officers, including the Kakdiwp SDPO and the district SP. They even went  to the state women’s commission.The agony at not finding her daughter hit her mother Samira Biwi very hard.  Samira was already suffering from mental illness. Her condition  deteriorated after Tahira went missing. Samira had stopped communicating  with anyone. She occasionally asked when her daughter would come back  home. Moved by her plight, Tahira’s step-mother Johra Biwi (Khater’s  second wife) stepped in and moved Calcutta high court in July 2009.“I  could not bear to see Tahira’s mother suffering silently. Moreover, I  brought up Tahira myself due to her mother’s mental condition. She was  just a few months old when I got married. She was very attached to me,”  Johra said.Though some of the accused were arrested, police failed to trace the girl, adding to the family’s agony.The  matter was finally transferred to the court of the chief justice in  April this year and was subsequently treated as a PIL In September. In a  landmark judgment, the high court directed the director general of  police (DGP) to trace and produce the girl by November 12.Tahira  was finally traced in Delhi on Thursday. State ADG (law and order)  Surajit Kar Purakayastha said a team from the state CID and the Delhi  Police had been able to trace the girl.---A Follow-up : First, from today's (18th Dec.) The Telegraph and then ToIGirl recoils at fear of ostracism in Bengal    - ‘Tortured, humiliated and brainwashed’                                                                                 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUINew Delhi, Dec. 17: Kidnapped and  sold last year and rescued from Delhi yesterday, 16-year-old Bengal girl  Yasmin Khatun says she doesn’t want to return home for fear of  ostracism.                                                                                Consumed with  shame and misplaced guilt at the “different” life she has led for the  past year and a half, Yasmin (name changed) has told police and social  workers she has “grave doubts” about ever being accepted by the people  of her South 24-Parganas village, Balikhali.                                                                                “She is both  traumatised and humiliated,” said Bengal CID inspector Sarbari  Bhattacharya, the leader of the police team that came to Delhi to rescue  the Kakdwip girl who was abducted in April last year.                                                                                “She told me she  doesn’t want to go back to Bengal because she is unsure how she would be  received. She wants to remain in Delhi. The traffickers who brought her  to Delhi have brainwashed her into thinking that she would be  humiliated and taunted by her own people if she ever returns home.”                                                                                Tomorrow, the  Delhi government’s child welfare committee (CWC) will counsel Yasmin and  try to dispel her fears. At some point of time, Yasmin may have to  travel at least to Calcutta, whose high court has asked the police to  produce her.                                                                                CWC chairperson  Neera Mallick, however, said: “The girl needs counselling at least for  the next six months before she is exposed to the world.”                                                                                Inspector  Bhattacharya said the traffickers would torture Yasmin every time she  said she wanted to return home, and had brainwashed her into thinking  that after her life in Delhi, she would be an “untouchable” back in  Bengal.                                                                                “She is confused,” Bhattacharya said. “Sometimes she smiles and sometimes she suddenly starts crying.”                                                                                Over a period of  time, the officer said, Yasmin began believing she would never be able  to leave and began accepting her life in Delhi. Her tormentors then  started tutoring her in etiquette and the social graces, and bought her  expensive dresses, to transform  the rustic girl into a “lady of  society”.                                                                                “I was surprised  last night when, while having dinner, she suddenly asked for a napkin,”  Bhattacharya said. “I never expected that from a village girl. But I  quickly realised that the traffickers had been grooming her. The room we  rescued her from had an air-conditioner.”                                                                                Rashi Aditi Ghosh,  of the NGO Shakti Vahini, who had accompanied the police on the raid to  rescue the girl, too said that Yasmin had told her she didn’t want to  “go back to her baba and maa”.                                                                                “She said she was disgusted with her father’s foul behaviour. She seemed confused and may not be telling the whole truth.”                                                                                It’s not clear  what Yasmin has against her 61-year-old father Khater Bhisti, a fish  seller, but she owes her freedom to her unlettered stepmother Johora  Bibi who, faced with initial police apathy, fought a lone crusade to  take the battle to the high court.                                                                                Ghosh said her NGO   had helped rescue many  trafficked girls and that  she did not find  Yasmin’s behaviour unusual. Having accepted their new life, especially  the “material comforts” that come with it, many of the girls are  reluctant to return home.                                                                                 “Yasmin is ashamed  of the life she has been forced to lead but, at the same time, she  has  grown used to the comforts. In this confused state she may be trying to  find excuses not to return home,” Ghosh said.                                                                                “Many girls we have rescued have behaved in this way, but she needs counselling and someone she can open her heart to.”                                                                                For now, Yasmin is staying at Nirmal Chhaya, a home  for girls run by the Delhi government’s social welfare department.Rescued girl doesn’t want to go home Alleges Sexual Abuse By Kin; NGO Says Story Could’ve Been Fabricated To Avoid Poverty Sumati Yengkhom & Dwaipayan Ghosh | TNN Kolkata/New  Delhi: For more than a year, Johura Biwi fought relentlessly to get her  step-daughter home. In fact, it was the grit and determination of this  illiterate-but-feisty village woman that led to Tahira Khatun (16) being  finally traced. Otherwise, the minor girl from this nondescript village  called Balikhal in Kakdwip subdivision of South 24-Parganas, would have  remained untraced like scores of girls who go missing from the state  every year. Tahira, who was trafficked and sold in Delhi, was rescued on  Thursday during a joint raid by Delhi Police and a CID team from the  state.   When Tahira went missing on Aprli 15 last year, her  father Khater Vishti had filed a missing complaint with Dholahat police  station. But in a few weeks, the fisherman, in his 60s, got busy with  work as he has to feed the family. And since Tahira’s mother Samira Biwi  suffers from mental disorder, it was left to Johura, in her late 30s,  to take up the fight.   “From kitchen to court, it has been a long journey. I had hardly ventured out of the village till I dragged myself  out as I knew I had to find our daughter back. Going to the police  station was frightening initially. Then I got going with the support of  the family,” said Johura who is Khater Vishti’s second wife.   The  news that Tahira has been traced has brought a lot of relief to the  family. They are now waiting for Tahira to come back home. Her mother  Samira Biwi specially is getting impatience.   But Tahira has  reportedly expressed that she does not want to go back home. In a  startling revelation, the girl is believed to have told her counsellor  Rashi Aditi Ghosh in Delhi that a close relative had tried to exploit  her sexually earlier. Though she admitted that she was sold off by the  accused in Delhi, she is apparently not comfortable with the idea of  going back home.   However, there is a high probability of Tahira  cooking up stories of this sexual exploitation to avoid going back to  poverty. According to Delhi-based NGO Shaktivahini that had provided the  counsellors for Tahira, the girl who reportedly is stunningly  beautiful, apparently has been making good money. Though she did not  operate from red light areas, Kadir, who bought her, possibly had been supplying her to high-profile clients.   “Easy  and good money seems to have gone into her head. And it is quite  natural for a girl of her age, who is yet to be mature enough to  understand what’s good for her and what  is not. There is a high chance of the girl fabricating the story of  some relatives trying to sexually exploit her so that she is not sent  back home. The girl needs counselling,” said Rishi Kant of Shativahini.   The  girl, who could not even get a square meal back home, now reportedly  wears branded clothes and accessories. In two years, the gullible  village girl has reportedly transformed into a big city girl who lives  life on the fast lane.   According to what Tahira has told Ghosh,  she had willingly accompanied her sister-in-law Jasmina on April 15,  2009, when the latter promised her to take her to the fair. “At the  fair, she met Kalam — a resident of Park Street in Kolkata — and  followed him as he promised her security from her abusive relative. On  the way to Kolkata, Kalam allegedly offered her a soft drink laced with  sedatives. The next thing she remembers is that she was on a train to  Delhi. She was sold off to Azhar for Rs 6,000,” said Ghosh.   Delhi  crime branch officers said later, Kadir and Azhar fell out over the  share of money. “Kadir was demanding more money for the girl and Azhar  sold her for the second time to avoid a confrontation with Kadir,” said the investigating officer.   Cops  said the “lead” in their search for Tahira had come after they managed  to arrest Kalam from Park Street. They nabbed Azhar after forcing Kalam  to call him up and tell him that he had brought “two beautiful girls”  from Bengal and wanted to sell them. “Two woman members of the NGO acted  as decoys and we arrested him as soon as he tried to escape,” said a  senior officer.   Cops said Azhar was a “rich” man who holds  several bank accounts on fake identities. Police are now probing whether  Azhar’s two wives – one in Hyderabad and the other in Meerut — too were  involved in the all-India trafficking racket. “We are also looking into  possible links of Azhar in bringing 53 girls from Jharkhand, Bengal and  Bihar to the Capital for prostitution just before the Commonwealth  Games,” added a crime branch officer.   Azar left Delhi for  Kolkata by Rajdhanai Express on a two-day transit remand on Friday  evening. However, it might take a couple of days for Tahira to be  brought to Kolkata. The Child Welfare board in Delhi is expected to  finalise the date on Saturday.The Telegraph keeps following up.New Delhi, Dec. 18:  Yasmin, the Bengal girl rescued here on Thursday, today said she  preferred her “new life” to the poverty and hunger that awaited her back  home, shining a light on causes that underpin trafficking and the  challenges ahead of rehabilitation agencies.                                                             Yasmin (name changed), 16, also confirmed that her relative Kashmira Bibi had handed her over to traffickers.                                                                                “Ghar jaane se achchha hai yahan pe mar jana (better to die here than return home),” the girl, kidnapped from Kakdwip in April last year, told The Telegraph in fluent Hindi.                                                                                Yasmin said she  had grown used to the comforts of her life in Delhi’s “party circuit”,  learnt Hindi and forgotten to speak Bengali in these 20 months, and now  called the couple who had bought her “Papa” and “Mummy”.                                                                                In her village of  Balikhali in South 24-Parganas, “hunger stares one in the face”, she  said. “I will die of starvation there. I’ve got used to a life of  comfort after sacrificing a lot; there’s no point going back.”                                                                                She is also afraid of stigma: “People will laugh at me and make up stories about me…. Now I hate my village and its people.”                                                                                Yasmin will,  however, have to board the Rajdhani Express tomorrow with Bengal CID  officers and will be reaching Calcutta on Monday morning to be presented  before the high court. She spoke to this newspaper at Banga Bhavan  shortly after counselling by the Delhi government’s child welfare  committee (CWC), which cleared her journey to Bengal.                                                                                CWC chairperson  Neera Mallick said a traumatised Yasmin needed counselling and “a lot of  care and affection” for six months before she could be rehabilitated.                                                                                 “It now depends on  the Bengal government how they provide counselling and other facilities  to help her return to normal life. If they fail to do so, the girl  could return to the world her tormentors had thrown her into.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Yasmin said her  sister-in-law’s sibling Kashmira had handed her over to a man called  Kalam, who brought her to Delhi, sexually abused her in a hotel and sold  her to Azhar.                                                                                She was finally  sold to a couple whom she addressed as “Papa” and “Mummy”. The husband,  Pappu, groomed her in manners and etiquette, showered her with gifts and  gave her a new name: Julie.                                                                                “There were five  other girls. A woman gave us Hindi lessons. We were given expensive  clothes and good food. I loved my air-conditioned room; I drank only  mineral water. I would go to a lot of parties and have been to big  hotels too. After a few months, I accepted the new life like the other  girls,” she said.                                                                                “They (Pappu and his wife) have given me a lot and I want to go back to them.”                                                                                Pappu went into hiding after Thursday’s police raid netted Azhar and rescued Yasmin.                                                                                Yasmin said she  had recently met a man from Moradabad, who had promised to marry her  after two years. “He owns a mutton shop. I want a happy life, not a life  like the girls at my village have.”                                                                                She said her  father Khater Bhisti, a 61-year-old fish seller, was a harsh man and had  pulled her out of school after Class III, fearing she might run away  with somebody. “I wanted to continue studying....”                                                                                Did she miss her village? “I have a very close friend, Mohitan, there... but she would have been married off by now.”                                                                                One day last year,  after her father had behaved particularly badly with her, Kashmira had  promised to find her a job outside Bengal.                                                                                “She told me my  father and stepmother hated me,” said Yasmin, who has been rescued  thanks to her illiterate stepmother’s unyielding crusade against police  apathy.                                                                                On April 15, 2009,  Yasmin was returning home after watching a circus when Kashmira  introduced her to Kalam, who was waiting on a motorcycle, and asked her  to go with him, Yasmin said. “I didn’t know he would sell me off.”                                                                                Kalam, a  32-year-old Calcuttan, rode straight to Howrah station and boarded a  train with her, saying he would find her a job. In Delhi, he took her to  a hotel, spiked her soft drinks and assaulted her, Yasmin said. “I wept  a lot that day.”                                                                                The next day, she  was sold off to Azhar. “They (Azhar and his associates) tortured me.  When I wanted to go back to my village, they threatened to kill me.”                                                                                Kalam, arrested in  November on trafficking charges, had helped the police arrest Azhar  here on Thursday. Both reached Calcutta today with a CID team. Azhar  will be produced in Kakdwip court tomorrow.                                                                                 Azhar, who wore  Versace woollens and Nike sneakers, has allegedly told the police he had  contacts across Bengal who would traffic girls to him."},

The village has more than 90 percent population belonging to backward caste and minority community. This makes the feat even more praiseworthy.What do we learn from this?While on one hand there is a need to rush help to backward places but a more permanent, self-reliant system can emerge if we try to make the existing machinery work effectively, maintaining vigil, recognizing superlative effort - thereby playing a catalytic role, not running something in parallel unless there is emergency or taken up as a short term measure. Greater effort should be made to make schools already in place function better.May be we need to understand their pain points and address them.May be we need to arrange school level, block level and then district level competition and reward students, mentoring teachers, school admin. and recognize their effort and boost their confidence.May be we need to take up academic oriented project like publication of magazine where every school is given 4 pages each to provide content (article, drawing etc.)May be we need to organize workshops for teachers which would be more like a get-together, picnic, edutainment gifts for their students - no preaching but success stories will be shared (no negatives, there are and will be challenges - important is how to overcome)....I shall add more points if they occur to me, also readers are most welcome to suggest. The idea is to make them feel good, increase confidence and stand by them instead of finding faults. May be voluntary youth groups, NSS units as those in IITs join hands and treat the people working at the grass root level  as partner for a stronger and better India.The above shows that they have the potential to excel. They are spread far and wide while youth organizations are serving only pockets and often not in a sustained manner or treated as outsider. The idea is to tap the potential of whatever is already there and channelize the energy, enthusiasm of youth groups in a more effective manner.The little experience we have gained so far, the Govt. always encourages this and there is a sense of admiration when IIT students try to reach out to villages. Come on, folks! Let's do it.Here is the link where this study has been published todayhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata-/Bengals-primary-education-myth-busted/articleshow/6979155.cms"},
{"title": "Backbencher", "date": "Sunday, November 21, 2010", "text": "“At Shibpur Dinabandhu Institution, I was a backbencher. Those of us who sat at the back were treated shabbily.\"What makes people take note of a backbencher? Today's edition of The Telegraph comes up with this ennobling article.A 73-year-old retired teacher, who has almost lost an eye to glaucoma  and suffers from throat cancer, has been taking classes gratis at his  old school for 12 years in a state where the government had to ban  private tuition so that teachers do not neglect classes.He is Prasanta Kumar Banerjee who retired in February 1998 but his passion for teaching soon drove  him back to the classroom. The Shibpur resident had cut down on classes  only a year back, on the advice of doctors who had diagnosed his throat  cancer.“I love teaching, especially those who are considered backbenchers. From  my experience, I know each student can do well if he is taught properly  and confidence is instilled in him. Poverty and family problems keep  many children from performing to their potential.”In Banerjee’s case, poverty forced him to  concentrate on studies so that he could contribute to the family income.  His father Jatindranath, an employee of the Survey of India at  Shillong, Meghalaya, had died when he was only a year old, leaving the  family of eight desperately in need of money.                                                                                 They returned to  their ancestral home in Shibpur. Prasanta and two of his elder brothers  were admitted to the primary section of Shibpur  Dinabandhu Institution.  In Class IX, he failed twice and had to switch to Praganananda  Saraswati Vidhalaya.Banerjee returned to Praganananda Vidhalaya as a teacher in 1960 after completing his BA from ND College, Howrah.                                                                                “Soon after  joining, I discovered that there were many students who needed extra  care. I asked them to come to my home for extra classes, for which I did  not take money. But since I believe that students should give their  teachers gurudakshina, I used to take a haritaki (chebulic myrobalans), a poitey (sacred thread) and 25 paise from each.”                                                                                Milan Chakraborty,  a Howrah doctor who is one of the many students whose future Banerjee  shaped, recounted: “All students, whether they were meritorious or not,  liked to attend sir’s history and Bengali classes. He taught so well  that the classes seemed fun.”Now comes the turning point. What made this backbencher beat all where it really counts?\"At Praganananda Vidhalaya, the  then headmaster, late Makhanlal Chattopadhyay, was a wonderful teacher.  He encouraged and motivated me. I soon became better at studies. That  was when I realised that teaching with care and affection could turn a  bad boy into a good one.”\"Each soul is potentially divine,\" says Vivekananda, \"The goal is to manifest that divinity.\"(The content appeared in today's edition of The Telegrapph.)"},
{"title": "Expertize", "date": "Sunday, October 31, 2010", "text": "Narayan Murthy, Infosys founder are available for comments on various topics. He does not shy away for making his views known. His take on two topics are reproduced below. One is close to his field of interest, where his expertize lies. The other is little far. And the difference is palpable. First excerpts from his interview appearing in today's Economic Times.On another note, one of the US Senators referred to the Indian IT companies as ‘chop shops’. Did the remark dismay you?If somebody who knew what we were doing or had an industry view or were a respected analyst, we would be worried. But somebody who has no idea what this industry is all about and the kind of infrastructure we have built here and in 70 other countries, makes such a statement, we should be charitable to such a person. All of us, when we get older, tend to do things that are not the best. Once in a while our logic lapses, our memory lapses, we tend to say things we don’t mean. So I’d say let us look at it in that spirit. Next is his observation on Science & Technology in India that appeared on The Hindu, dated 28th October. Industry finances about 75 per cent of the R&D in Korea and Japan, 70 per cent in China and 65 per cent in the U.S. In India, by contrast, the government finances more than 80 per cent of our R&D expenditure. In a recent report, the Science Advisory Council to the Prime Minister noted: “Except in sectors like pharmaceuticals and drugs, our industry does not appear to be making major investments in and demands on Indian science.” Shouldn't Indian industry, especially the high-technology sectors, be doing more to create and drive domestic R&D?I think it works both ways. While the Indian industry has to show more interest in collaborating with the Indian academic community, it is necessary for the Indian academic community to show more interest in working with industry. Let me give you a very simple example. Every year, I receive a number of visitors from several International universities like Cornell University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Cambridge, University of Michigan, etc, etc. The professors from these universities are so keen on solving our problems. I would be very happy to also receive professors from our own institutions like the Indian Institute of Science, the IITs, and others. Our academicians must be interested in solving our problems.Many multi-nationals have established R&D facilities in India. Do you think India's Information Technology industry is doing enough by way of creating R&D capabilities for itself?We at Infosys have our software engineering and technology laboratories where there are 600 people working on issues that are relevant to our needs. So those are huge research laboratories. I think there are other companies too, which have such things. So therefore the answer is yes.The best students will always go to where they get the best jobs and pay, and that is to be found in industry these days. A research career on the other hand, means protracted training and less remuneration. So how does one make such a career attractive to young people?I have suggested several times to various institutions that for every paper that is produced in a world-class refereed journal, they could give Rs. four lakh. So that if you produce four papers in a year, then you have got Rs. 16 lakh. Add to that a salary of Rs. six or eight lakh a year, then you have got a decent sum.Does anybody see a connection between these two interviews? There are few comments by academicians on the later in a blog maintained by an IISc Professor http://nanopolitan.blogspot.com/2010/10/nr-narayana-murthy-on-how-to-attract.html#comments . Excerpts from that.1. \"Where do the institutions get the money to give 4 lakhs per paper?..What happens when industry hikes the salary to put the 4 lakhs/paper money to shame?...Scientific research is not a money-making enterprise. It is high time people realize that. If they dont, I doubt whether they would really have the patience to spend years on researching something that might or might not throw up cool results. The type of folks who cant see beyond the $$ cant bet a scientist - they are more suited to be a manager and deserve to be in the industry....IMHO, the other benefits of an academic life are equally, if not more important than the $$$ - freedom to choose research topics, get adequate research funding, access to quality research facilities, all the while earning an amount that lets us life comfortably (and given the campus housing, one doesnt even need to think beyond the 6-8 lakhs of basic salary). Long time back, I recall a professor telling me \"The difference between the industry and the academic payscale is the amount of money you are willing to pay for your freedom\". This is something anyone wanting to come to academics will do well to keep in mind. There is a price to be paid for everything.\"2. \"Mr Narayana Murthy seems to be the typical Indian businessman: he thinks throwing money is enough to solve any problem. I am disappointed....But the first question really is -- do we need more scientists at our existing research institutions? I think not. What we need is more and better universities. And, of course, scientists to fund those universities -- but we need to make our universities attractive places for a career in science (and humanities and other fields). Perhaps Mr Narayana Murthy has thought about throwing money at that problem?\"3. \"The views of Narayan Murthy are hardly surprising. He has always been fairly trivial, particularly with regard to education, science and research. For them everything boils down to money. Just because you started a successful outsourcing company does not mean you have the wisdom to know how to encourage research...BTW by his prescription (and to make it slightly ridiculous) Einstein's paper, say on special relativity, and say any one of my papers, say in Physical Review D would get Rs 4 lakhs each. How nice...didn't know my papers had equal value. And poor Mr Einstein would finally end up with fewer lakhs than many of our local scientists who are paper producing factories.\"Strong words. From what he said in today's paper, we may find Murthy worrying about these comments and soon we shall have something from him in another interview.  Till then ..."},
{"title": "Flat Rate", "date": "Tuesday, October 19, 2010", "text": "Eradicating poverty with flat rate of interest? SKS Microfinace, the largest in India with 73 lakhs of customers is in limelight for two reasons - hugely successful IPO and sacking of its CEO immediately after that. This got attention of people and we get educated about this flat rate of interest the profiteering microfinance companies charge. Today's edition of TOI reports, \"While offering a loan, they often quote a “10% flat” rate of interest, which, on the face of it, appears like a good deal. However, there is a catch. This ‘flat’ rate of interest means that it will not be calculated on reducing balance. It implies that even after the borrower has paid a few installments, the interest would still be calculated on the initial sum borrowed, and not on the balance loan amount. The result is a (hidden) final rate of interest of 24-30%, or even higher for the poor who can barely afford a square meal a day. “Microfinance, as practised by MFIs is unethical to the extent that it evades the truth in lending,” said R Balakrishnan, a financial market veteran turned independent adviser.\" And SKS uses 12.5% of flat rate of interest!!!Now one cannot be faulted to think them as \"no better than moneylenders but have so far been able to operate under the pious garb of poverty eradicators.\"Add to this the strong arm tactics used. TOI further says,\"The high rate of interest is also leading to defaults and fraud. Recently, there has been a spurt in suicides in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, allegedly due to harassment by MFI agents who started resorting to strong-arm tactics to recover loans as chances of default rise. M Subba Rao, of NGO Masses, who trained under Grameen Bank founder and Nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, describes the cases of alleged harassment by MFIs as the result of ‘irresponsible lending’. “There is high pressure on the staff (of private MFIs) to lend. They have targets to meet and they dump money (on people) in many cases,” said Rao.  Consider this: The loan outstanding, according to the latest estimate by Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN), the organization of 40 MFIs, is about 30,000 crore with about 3 crore poor banking on MFIs for their financial needs. While the four southern states of AP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala account for a chunk of this borrowing, West Bengal and Orissa too have rural poor relying on MFIs. Besides, the sector is also on an uptick in UP and Haryana.\"This was lesson for even seasoned bankers like State Bank of India chief. The concludig part of TOI report says, \"Of course, eradicating poverty through the MFI route, for some, is a lucrative business. The IPO document by SKS disclosed that Gurumani was drawing an annual salary of Rs 1.5 crore, an equal amount or more as performance bonus, and also a onetime bonus of Rs 1 crore. Akula is entitled to up to 1% of SKS’s net profit, in addition to ESOPs.Not surprisingly the ‘success’ of some of the MFIs and the mega-listing of SKS recently have stunned even seasoned bankers. When asked about the success of the MFI business in India, during a recent interview with TOI, O P Bhatt, chairman of State Bank of India, said even he was surprised by their numbers. He wanted to go deeper into their finances and business model to understand how MFIs, who borrow from banks, including SBI, can make profit which these very banks can’t make. The same is the case with some other finance veterans. After all, like mobile tariff plans, no financial product is protected by patents and IPRs and the uniqueness of any new and lucrative one cannot last for more than 24 hours.The problem seems to be with the business model, and not the approach. In India, largely there are three kinds of MFIs: The self-help groups (SHGs) which are government-supported MFIs, nonprofit NGOs and the private for-profit firms. \""},

Deputy Magistrate cum Deputy Collector of Kharagpur was at the other end. \"I saw the work that NSS, IIT Kharagpur is doing. I thought that I should ring you and tell that we very much appreciate these initiatives. I wish I could be there on NSS Day celebration (24th Sept.) but for the admin. work. However, I have gone through the links. You are doing great work.\" We conversed in Bengali and this is a poor translation and I must say I was overwhelmed by that Sunday morning call. All that I could say was to thank him and the district admin. for lending all support and that it is all teamwork. Now to some more golden moments of last 24 hours.This advertizement cam up in today's TOI, Kolkata Edition. I do not have any insider information of this organization. Apparently, they are doing well for the masses in healthcare. More important is the message that they want to send across which clear, distinct and loud. Appears that not only they have a heart of gold but they are the ones who do not believe in passive goodness. Newspapers are bustling these days with the news of a golden girl, Deepika Kumari of Ranchi. Not cowed down by the hardship of an extended family mangaed by father, an auto-rickshaw driver and mother, a nurse this tribal girl started practising archery only 3 years ago when she was spotted to accurately aim mango fruits in orchards. Besides the most recent Commonwealth Games Gold she won youth world archery championship last year. Deepika's mother says that Deepika does not have a mobile phone which makes one distract. She is quite appreciative of the seniors in the Indian Archery team and she reaches her through these seniors. Good to see that more famous seniors like Dola Banerjee who received a bronze medal does not envy the younger team member and have taken up theresponsibility of nurturing the talent. The other gold spot is the Tata Archery Academy who is training most of India's archery talents. It will be wonder if other corporate houses too look at other sports and nurture talent in a nation obsessed with cricket. Now few quotes from Deepika's parents, school teahers from various newspapers: (The Hindu, The Telegrap, Hindustan Times)Ms. Mahato (Mother), was not too pleased with Deepika taking up archery. “She was the first in the extended family to play any sport. I never supported her decision at the beginning. But now things have changed I feel proud of her,” she said.“As a Class XI student, she has plenty of school work and Deepika never neglected that part of her life. She is an average student and does well in exams,” said Mr. Mahato.“She has the ability to concentrate for long and this has helped her,” her  parents said.Her parents don’t have to pay anything for her sport as she gets a monthly stipend of Rs. 6,000 from the Tata Archery Academy, which is enough for her they think.---In the crowd in front of the archer’s house was Nand  Kishore Jha, the principal of the state-run APEG Residential School, Ratu, where  Deepika had studied till Class VIII. “Deepika scored average marks. She would go unnoticed  at school except for the times when she used to target mangoes on the campus.  Her target was mostly on the mark. However, in case of misses, she would  continue to target that elusive mango till she succeeded. I was impressed by her  marksmanship,” Jha recalled. Another teacher, Chotan Vishwakarma, recalled that  Deepika was weak in math. “She passed matriculation in 2009 though she was away  most of the time. That year, she clinched a gold medal at World Archery Youth  Championship in Ogden and we were proud of her. We had to give her special  coaching for two months before her exam,” he said."},
{"title": "CSR", "date": "Friday, October 8, 2010", "text": "Got interested to know about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Read this article at http://www.ibef.org/artdispview.aspx?in=84&art_id=26104&cat_id=926&page=1 More to come.There are interesting articles athttp://timesascent.in/index.aspx?page=article&sectid=64&contentid=200905312009053112045370131a710bdhttp://www.business-standard.com/india/news/india-inc-faces-2-csr-levy/407350/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823101110.htm---------------Corporate Social Responsibility / Human ResourceLast Updated: June 2010Indian companies are now expected to discharge their stakeholder responsibilities and societal obligations, along with their shareholder-wealth maximisation goal.Nearly all leading corporates in India are involved in corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes in areas like education, health, livelihood creation, skill development, and empowerment of weaker sections of the society. Notable efforts have come from the Tata Group, Infosys, Bharti Enterprises, ITC Welcome group, Indian Oil Corporation among others.The 2010 list of Forbes Asia’s ‘48 Heroes of Philanthropy’ contains four Indians. The 2009 list also featured four Indians. India has been named among the top ten Asian countries paying increasing importance towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure norms. India was ranked fourth in the list, according to social enterprise CSR Asia's Asian Sustainability Ranking (ASR), released in October 2009.According to a study undertaken by an industry body in June 2009, which studied the CSR activities of 300 corporate houses, corporate India has spread its CSR activities across 20 states and Union territories, with Maharashtra gaining the most from them. About 36 per cent of the CSR activities are concentrated in the state, followed by about 12 per cent in Gujarat, 10 per cent in Delhi and 9 per cent in Tamil Nadu.The companies have on an aggregate, identified 26 different themes for their CSR initiatives. Of these 26 schemes, community welfare tops the list, followed by education, the environment, health, as well as rural development.Further, according to a study by financial paper, The Economic Times, donations by listed companies grew 8 per cent during the fiscal ended March 2009. The study of disclosures made by companies showed that 760 companies donated US$ 170 million in FY09, up from US$ 156 million in the year-ago period. As many as 108 companies donated over US$ 216,199, up 20 per cent over the previous year.Although corporate India is involved in CSR activities, the central government is working on a framework for quantifying the CSR initiatives of companies to promote them further. According to Minister for Corporate Affairs, Mr Salman Khurshid, one of the ways to attract companies towards CSR work is to develop a system of CSR credits, similar to the system of carbon credits which are given to companies for green initiatives.Moreover, in 2009, the government made it mandatory for all public sector oil companies to spend 2 per cent of their net profits on corporate social responsibility.Besides the private sector, the government is also ensuring that the public sector companies participate actively in CSR initiatives. The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has prepared guidelines for central public sector enterprises to take up important corporate social responsibility projects to be funded by 2-5 per cent of the company's net profits.As per the guidelines, companies with net profit of less than US$ 22.5 million will earmark 3-5 per cent of profit for CSR, companies with net profit of between US$ 22.5 million - US$ 112.5 million, will utilise 2-3 per cent for CSR activities and companies with net profit of over US$ 112.5 million will spend 0.5-2 per cent of net profits for CSR.-----------------------------------The following points are notable from the document http://www.civilsocietyonline.com/Polic.htmDRAFT NATIONAL POLICY ON THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR - 20064.4 There has been much public debate on the voluntary sector, particularly its governance, accountability, and transparency. It is widely believed that the voluntary sector must address these issues through suitable self-regulation, as is the practice in various other fields. The government will encourage the evolution of, and subsequently accord recognition to, an independent, national level, self-regulatory agency for the voluntary sector.4.5 At the same time, there is need to bolster public confidence in the voluntary sector by opening it up to greater public scrutiny. The Government will encourage Central and State level agencies to introduce norms for filing basic documents in respect of VOs which have been receiving funding by Government agencies and placing them in the public domain (with easy access through the internet) in order to inculcate a spirit of public oversight.4.6 Public donation is an important source of funds for the voluntary sector, and one that can and must increase substantially. Tax incentives play a positive role in this process. Stocks and shares have become a significant form of wealth in the country today. In order to encourage transfer of shares and stock-options to VOs, the government will consider suitable tax rebates for this form of donation. The government will also simplify and streamline the system for granting income tax exemption status to charitable projects under the Income Tax Act. At the same time, the government will consider tightening administrative and penal procedures to ensure that these incentives are not misused by paper charities for private financial gain.----------------------------------The issue raised by Ramesh K. CTO & Human Search Engine at http://www.linkedin.com/answers/non-profit/social-entrepreneurship/NNP_SOC/719461-14264156 is also important.Big problem is identifying the deserving candidates. Misuse of funds by agencies and/or identification of deserving candidates are critical factors. Some donate 'extra' money to tell others that they donate .Corporate Social Responsibility has become a style statement.Many people claim to be into charity. Ask them how much they personally contributed. And then see the salaries of the people working in NGOs/Charity organizations.I also heard that the NGOs can retain some 15% of the contributions for 'operational expenses'.Many people who claim to champion charity may have collected donations from other and they themselves would notnhave contributed a single penny. But, this is a bit better as they are atleast getting some help from others who can.I strongly believe that Corporates can do a lot. Even individuals can do a lot."},

A few IITkgp alumni too have indirectly approached through some senior students to contribute to NSS cause. NSS with 20 lakhs nation-wide volunteers is a force with immense potential. IITkgp led from the front in the area of higher education in independent India. It will be great to see it in the forefront of NSS activities too where youth directly participate in rebuilding India, reaching out to the poor and underprivileged."},
{"title": "A Visit", "date": "Monday, September 27, 2010", "text": "It was put on the 'NSS Employment Opportunities' mailgroup - a visit to a nearby High School to interact with higher class students on career opportunities. This group of 16 NSS IIT Kharagpur student volunteers are preparing a digest of opportunities at various levels - if someone clears Class VIII, then Class X, Class XII etc., scholarships, jobs, self-employment opportunities. The ones available in mass market are targeted towards those who are more educated and have buying power. Here the target is to reach out all the sections.This was the fiirst dedicated field trip of the group and we looked for people. A few had a sudden opportunity to visit B.D.O. office and interact with S.D.O., B.D.O., Deputy Magistrates few weeks back. A reader-friendly :-) report from a volunteer as she found it is available here http://ashitaanand.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/what-comes/We asked for options. The vehicle can accomodate up to 4 students. The no. of students interested were more than 4. The requirement was to have working knowledge of Bengali, the volunteer can speak in simple English or Hindi. Finally, 4 of us set off at 1:30 p.m. on Sat, the 25th Sept. The Arya Vidyapith school is another 2 KM or so on the Big Bazaar Road further away. When we reached there Swami Sunishthananda, Principal, Ramakrishna Mission School, Midnapur was addressing students. I have listened to him before. The audience listened to him with apt attention. The NSS IITkgp student volunteers were spell-bound, they never had an opportunity to participate in such discussion. Being naturally gifted they as IITians usually do not face problem with concentration, control over mind. Here Swamiji was addressing to so called 'ordinary' students who can rise above 'mediocrity' by using mind as a tool. Later it was found that it is equally applicable to IITians too and lots of 'psychological' issues heard in IIT campus may benefit from such discussions. Received the following in mail of one student volunteer .... \"I called up my Mom and told her about this. She was glad and wished if she could be there too! \" Another volunteer recorded it in his cell phone. I shall share the link later.If the reader at this point is curious to know what excited the our students so much, a summary is pasted at the end of this post. But that definitely is a poor copy of what actually was experienced. Still it may be useful to many.Our turn came next. First we had a semi-formal Q & A session. Aftert that we informally met in groups. Even at 4:30 p.m. (SAT is half-day and we were supposed to end at 3 pm) the students did not leave the school and they were hungry for more. The teachers persuaded them to leave as guardians might be anxious. They left only after extracting assurance from us that we would come back. We interacted with the teachers in staff-room, had snacks and when we came out and were about to leave, found some students were still waiting.Yesterday evening we had a short group meeting. Yes, we'll return to this school and visit other places too. But this first interaction exposed us to some of our short-comings in the preparation. Accordingly, responsibilities were fixed and each student volunteer now will prepare two posters on specific themes related to various opportunities. We'll have approx. 30 such posters in different class rooms and shall interact with the students.Before I end this section I would like to point to an inspiring article I read in today's The Telegraph, how a school teacher in a non-descript village is making a difference. The link is available here http://telegraphindia.com/1100928/jsp/bengal/story_12991004.jsp-------Now the student reports on this visit - minus the names.On Sat, Sep 25, 2010 at 8:31 PM, xxxx wrote:Hi Sir,These are the few points I recalled till now. A lot of things are storming in mind, might click at a later time. But if you remember some other point apart from these, do mail me. I would love to compile them in a notebook.- When a man wanted to understand the difference between hell and heaven, he was taken to Hell first. He saw a large table with plenty of delicious and tasty food and a large no. of people on the either side of it. But interestingly, nobody could eat even a bit, as their hands were stretched out, freezed! He was moved by their pathetic condition and wished to go to heaven then. Amazingly, he saw the same situation there too, but the only difference being, the oppositely seated people fed each other! A perfect example of selflessness. This brings out the difference clearly.- Happiness is like pouring oil from a container to the other - Clear, pure and uninterrupted.- Theorists say that there's no Absolute Truth. But if you take a bite of a green chilly, you'll certainly end up itching your tongue - Sri Ramakrishna (My Hero!)- Things which we do out of necessity once, slowly become our habits. Thus go for proper necessities only.- When you climb a mango tree and place the ladder in the wrong place, the effort you put in to climb up, goes wasted totally. You need to climb down again, find a proper place and again repeat the process. This tells us that when efforts are put in the right place, the same effort leads us to the sweet fruit positively. But on the other hand that effort when put wrongly, goes wasted and yields nothing.- Our mind can be considered as a \"Band Party\". Sometimes we need to be spectators. Especially while meditating. We must watch our mind rush past. All thoughts will storm our brains. Then finally, like the procession is out of sight, our mind is totally empty. This is the time we start innovating ideas.On Sat, Sep 25, 2010 at 10:21 PM, Goutam Saha wrote:Thanks xxxx.The other points?

About the queries of the students, they are much into knowing what must they do clear JEE. Also, they wanted to know whether CBSE is better than WB Board. The girls laid most of their questions on confidence building and concentration development. And some of them wanted an alternative to Engg and Medical (like field of sports, music and other cultural activities).If you could tell me when their Annual Day is, we could have a more precise deadline for our compilation.

I have attached the recordings which I did on that day, which can be played using Quick Time. I have attached my report as well. I have mentioned some of the points, and will will send any new if I am able to write a better one. ........ Please send your suggestions and pardon the misakes which I might have committed. Thanking You,MY FIRST NSS VISITMy first NSS visit was really a very encouraging and memorable one. Sir took me, xxxx and xxxx to Aryya Vidyapeeth, where we had been invited for a function and were supposed to interact with the stdudents. We reached there at about 2.00 p.m. When we reached there, Maharaj Ji from Ramkrishna Mission was speaking to the (students). This was the first event of its kind organized there. We also joined them. Teachers and students of the school were already sitting there. Maharaj Ji spoke on various topics like meditation, increasing concentration and how to develop into a complete human being who can be really useful not only to himself, but to the society and country as a whole. He is a really good orator and all of us were just mesmerized listening to him. Everything he explained so clearly and with such logical examples that all of us, even the smallest ones, could easily understand him. He spoke in Bengali, and here I have tried to translate a few of the points on which he spoke, and present the meaning in my own words :“Today, we talk of freedom and consider ourselves to be free, but the reality is totally else wise. We are enslaved by desires. The modern man is not hesitating in doing something wrong in order to gain some profit. ..... Like a honey bee which gets stuck in the same honey which it comes to enjoy, we are similarly imprisoned by our worldly desires and pleasures. We have forgotten that real joy comes from inside, it is not a commodity to be found outside. No one is satisfied. We want more and more.”“Meditation is the way to have a proper control on our own mind. It is to be in command of our own senses. Like a road is etched in the mud by vehicles moving constantly over it, similarly we can be in charge of our mind through constantly practicing meditation.”“Human being can’t consider himself small. He thinks of the infinite. All the movies, like spider-man, batman, etc where you see people doing things which are extraordinary are all a reflection of this desire of man. Use this spirit to your benefit. Make someone great your idol, love him more than your love and you will yourself see how you raise in love ( instead of falling in love as is usually the case ).”“Heaven is here, hell is here! It just depends on your mentality. Let me explain it by a story. Once a man, after his death, was asked by Yamraaj to express his last wish. The man wanted to see heaven and hell. So he was first taken to hell, where he saw that a large feast had been organized, with all kinds of delicious food items. People were sitting at tables beside the food, but were unable to eat it as both their hands were plastered in full. The man was sad to see this pitiable condition. Next, he was taken to heaven, were also the same thing was there. There was a feast, and the hands were plastered. But here, a person took the food and fed his neighbor, and his neighbor did the same, so everyone was able to enjoy the food. What is the moral? Wherever people forget themselves and think about others, they create a heaven. And whenever we are selfish and worry only for our own benefit, we create a hell. “NOT ME, BUT YOU” and we create a paradise!”Well, Maharaj Ji spoke a lot more, and I can’t express the complete feeling in words.After that, we had a question-answer session, where students put up various questions, and this was the place which showed me both the usefulness of the work which we as a group are doing, as well as the amount of work which still remains for us to do in order to come up to the full expectations of the people. This section provided me an insight into the variety of topics like career in music, sports, etc which we need to cover.Later, we interacted directly with the students and talked with them and clarified some of their doubts. One boy of class X came up to me and asked about the future in Hotel Management. I accept I was not at all prepared for this, and I had to tell him that a basic qualification of class XII pass is required, which I happen to know since one of my relative was in this profession. After that, I need to find out what the possibilities are.In general, most of the students there wanted to be just well off with a peaceful life. They were not too eager to be an engineer or a doctor in particular. But most of them lacked self confidence. They were pressurized by the upcoming board exams, and it is definitely a thing which I had also encountered. So, many were just asking tips about how to fare well in the exams.I also saw the brand value of IIT which I had heard. We were literally pampered by the students and the faculty (of the school) alike.We returned at around 5.00 p.m. I will definitely cherish the memories of this visit for a long time to come. It really inspired me to work harder in NSS and I hope to toil in with some more efforts. I hope we as a group will bring this work to a great finish, as per the expectation of not only sir, but of our own conscience and the society."},
{"title": "NSS Day", "date": "Saturday, September 25, 2010", "text": "The NSS Advisory Committee Meeting held on 23rd August appreciated the activities we proposed. But we were told to observe NSS Day, if required following US style at a later date, if there is Mid-Sem. Exam. or so. This time mid-sem was over by 20th Sept. while NSS Day is on 24th Sept. But we had difficulty in getting volunteers during (13th-20th Sept.) or the week before. But all the Program Officers made up for that during mid-sem week and student volunteers joined as soon as exam was over, using off-periods to visit villages for the remaining jobs.Yes, we wanted NSS Day celebration to be somewhat different from other functions of IIT. We wanted to avoid long speeches. We wanted to involve the community our volunteers are engaged with. We wanted to present our on-going activities with every student head speaking for 3 minutes using slides that have images of field work. The skit, NSS cultural team has prepared and is played as nukkad in villages to create awareness, would certainly be there. We wanted the whole function to be short, somewhat informal but disciplined even with 1000 capacity audience and we wanted to be punctual.I as a member of a faculty team was returning after a meeting with industry representatives from Mumbai. In the airport when we had free time I talked to our Director, IIT Khargpur and he readily agreed to make himself available for the entire function. That gave a lot of inspiration to the team. We lined up launch of NSS, IIT Kharagpur website, release of Newsletter NSS Day Edition to make the most of his presence and make the function a memorable one. This meant we needed to work harder and as a team. The student webteam wanted all the content made available to them at least 2 weeks before mid-sem exam.; some of the student groups had several false-starts :-) and had little to show as their activities on NSS Day, may be did not organize themselves properly (yes, there is a lot to do but the response in general says that a good beginning is made) etc.And then there were two unexpected visitors in my office on 31st of August! Both were final year students. Gou.... was in my Digital Electronics Class (non-EC) group years back. Sa... was not known beforehand. What they said was interesting and came as a sweet surprise. They are a group of final year students who came together in an 'Art of Living' program of Sri Sri Ravishankar. Later I received this link http://yesplusiitkgp.blogspot.com/2009/10/youve-made-difference.html from them. They are collecting about Rs. 5000 among themselves per month and want to spend it for underprivileged children's education. Sometime back there was an article by me on this topic at Scholar's Avenue (student's newsletter). They were exploring various opportunities and were curious about current NSS initiatives. First, I inquired about the source of fund and I was relieved that they were not collecting money from others and has complete ownership of the fund. I am little scared about so called NGOs who lack transparency and has become a source of earning for the fund collector/distributors in the name of administrative expenses. The result is marketing of 'poverty', fund raising campaigns, recruitment of salaried campaigners, so on an so forth. Please refer to my previous post http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2010/09/ngo.html I usually ask such NGO representatives how much you yourself are contributing and if audit is done by a reputed firm and if I can see the audit statement of last few years. Once donated for a cause, the money belongs to the underprivileged, effectively the underprivileged are the employer and you are the employee. Only in the 'NGO job (read, paid)' employee is better off than the 'employer' and often it is utter confusion who is serving whom. This is not to say that all NGOs are bad or so. I myself was taken care of by an NGO since Class III. The greater share of the greatest human beings of my life I met here. It is a more than 35 years old organization operating in other side of Kharagpur and has not a single piece of land or room of its own. Weekly study circle/meeting is held in residences of people from the community. Camps / Workshops take place in local schools. About 20 years back there was a talk to have its own building. In the executive meeting where this came as an agenda item it got rejected. The view was, \"We'll get one place of our own, in lieu we'll miss so many places in individual residences where we work within the community. By this, we'll be alienated from the community and be localized. If community is satisfied with our work, wants us to be amongst them, they will shelter us. If not, we'll have our meetings in a play ground, open space or simply dissolve ourselves. If we do good work, the community will protect us in their own interest.\" Contrary to this, most of the NGO work suffers from 'saviour complex', i.e. \"We'll save the poor etc.\" Even if the annual turnover in some year is approx. Rs. 10000, it is audited by Chartered Accountant. No single member takes a single rupee as allowance. If a professional job is to be done, it gets done and a receipt is collected. If possible, a discount is worked out. There is no guise, no cover of an NGO to offer professional service and get paid. Have an agency of ur own with proper registration, sales tax etc. offer service and get paid with appropriate transaction slip. Often people who are in full-time job get tempted to earn extra unaccounted income (which they are not authorized to) through this. The way 'religion' was brought to disrepute, there is a similar danger looming large in the name of 'social service' with proliferation of NGOs. And this has been pointed in Govt. survey, published in Hindustan Times and discussed in previous post.To avoid this, the well-meaning NGOs should spend some time in understanding what 'social service' is, what is social audit, how to keep accounts etc. before jumping into anything. Else there will be no checks and balances, it will be infiltrated by people who has other motives and the cause will be hijacked. One has to bring up next level of leadership and 'leading by example' is more true here. (Some of my thoughts on this can be found in http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2008/03/social-initiative-iitkgp.html ). Let me give one example how we work in an organization. Yesterday evening at about 7:15 p.m. attended a meet of a very well-meaning NGO where nobody draws a single Re. and each member donates handsomely. Proud to be associated with that where there is sacrifice. The meeting was discussing a fund-raising program where a corpus of Rs. 50000 was targeted. This is to feed quality lunch to one thousand relatively poor villagers of a nearby village. Since the amount is large, a proposal was floated to approach IIT community. Then came the question - what if they ask the purpose or what we expect to achieve by this. It was found that none had an answer except that it was directed by a very respected person who motivates the group, gives time and energy and himself has dedicated whole life for the poor and downtrodden. But this is an internal matter of the group who may be devoted to one person or the other. Will it be enough to convince general public so that they donate money for the cause? Then there was a brain-storming. The purpose was 'found' to be increasing interaction/involvement with larger section of the villagers where already a free coaching centre is run by the group by donation of members only. Then the question came - what do we want to do when the villagers get involved? There was no answer. Are we doing enough in what we have already involved - the free coaching centre where the numbers are reducing. Once there was about 30+ students and we appointed two paid teachers. Now the no.s have reduced and one wonders if two teachers are required. What I found that it was not liked to raise unpleasant questions or rather any question. Finally, it was decided to raise the money within the group itself as devotee of a great soul and fulfill his wish.Let us come back to NSS Day preparation. The digression is to give the two extremes in which we operate. This shows how GOs like NSS are important as a platform which need to be made functional - efficient and effective. NSS gives the platform and a mandate to conduct this exercise, else people may wonder about the motive, given the reputation certain NGO efforts. Also anything Govt. is considered reliable, secured, sustainable, not coming from a fly-by-night operator. Coupled with IIT brand, NSS IIT Kharagpur is a great potent force and if nurtured well can make a real difference. It is getting all support from local Govt. offices and Inst. Admin.Next, I was interested to know from those seniors if they wanted to involve themselves with the community or want to donate the money from a distance. While NSS can do the job identifying candidates because of its reach and ability to follow-up the donor should go to respective villages and see the things for themselves. Money here is a vehicle to get close to the underprivileged community but simply giving money on monthly basis is not going to solve the problem. The problem is to be solved together with the community and it cannot be enforced from outside. Often the problem is that of motivation, guidance, self-belief, self-respect being trampled for years. Money plays a small component and Govt. is constantly pushing money to social sector. They do not know how to get that or misuse it, give it to cheat fund who promise doubling of money in two years etc. - all because anything other than money. This is what I found from a recent discussion with a Punjab National bank official. And to my satisfaction they said, \"Yes.\"Then I explained the model we are following in NSS for child education and the targeted 'village school network'. Who benefit if a child from a village school does well? Who are the stake holders? Besides the child, the school teachers, parents, and local community are involved. NSS volunteers are going to these villages once a week and interact for a few hours. If all the stake holders unite, it ensures quality education for a child. There is an alternate model that asks students from villages to be brought to a central place where they are taught well and cared. It serves a purpose but may have an inherent weakness where the student remains somewhat alienated from the own community and the community do not really reap the benefit. Then there is a problem of scaling it up. Third these facilities are often run by paid employee and they may not be committed to social service and take it as another job. If there is no strict supervision and management of such schools, the quality cannot be ensured. A large and populous country like India with significant percentage of illiterate people and living below poverty line needs a more inclusive broad based strategy. There are Govt. run schools in villages. They have to be made real centre of learning. We need to work with these teachers, make them feel important, recognize their effort, make them partners. Similarly, we need to involve parents to prevent drop-outs, explain them how it is going to benefit (in the next post activity of one group on various career opportunities have been discussed - opportunities available if one clears Class VII, or Class X etc.). The local community leader if involved can do his part of the counselling. We shall recognize such leader's effort in some manner.Thus, the model proposed is to strengthen each existing link in the education chain by playing a catalytic role, by playing a role of an enabler - by giving scholarship to the students, by arranging workshop for the teachers in presence of D.I., S.I. of schools, by engaging community leader through a meeting with B.D.O and S.D.O. - recognizing, highlighting every lead with a no-criticism approach. \"What we are doing is good, can we do better?\" We are talking about a reward based approach, not punishment one to enhance the spirit. And the reward is to be devised in such a manner that it enhances happiness, satisfaction. Mere money is not going to help, how it is given is important.All these require innovation. Observation - Assimilation - Thinking - Planning - Execution. Requires 3 'H' - Hand, Head, Heart. One 'H' is not sufficient. We need such workers.We worked on both what we give and how we give. In fact, yesterday we discussed a proposal of one alumnus from abroad to infuse some more money on a particular project. We requested to hold it for some time as we want the present support which is significant amount to get absorbed first. Too much of easy money will dilute things and people will lose motivation to do better and get rewarded - worst of all, it may turn them beggar. However, we welcomed participation in underwriting another pilot project involving 10 families where high yield vegetable and fruit garden using waste water is being planned. A faculty member from Rural Development Centre is enthusiastic about it and is trying to make a plan ready asap. I may have a meeting with S.D.O. Kharagpur next week where some NSS volunteers will be assisting in a Health Camp in a nearby village. I may use that opportunity to discuss this.We then worked on a proposal of instituting merit-cum-means scholarships for students of these schools. Out of Rs. 5000 they are collecting among themselves each month, the students wanted to donate Rs. 3000 to this scholarships and Rs. 2000 to a nearby NGO run by an NRI catering to students drawn from villages but that NGO is facing financial difficulty (as told to them and they have not studied any audit statements). They wanted to confirm this by talking to their other team members and a few days later I had a meeting with five of them. Besides Gou.. and Sa..., there were Jaga..., Nih..., Sar... Another round of discussion and the confirmation came. We decided to start these scholarships from NSS Day itself. We got another Rs. 14000 of one time donation from an individual which would give an education-cum-game pack to each of the 14 schools. This also was earmarked for NSS Day. The final year students could not go to villages due to mid-sem exam in between but one of them accompanied us to Midnapur when we invited D.M., D.I, S.I. etc. and bought some specific requirement of a village High School from a book shop there (not available at Kharagpur). Through mail I kept them informed about the student selection process and their role on NSS Day. Program officers talked to each school teacher and awardee students directly by visiting each school. And later NSS volunteers invited teachers, guardians, local community leader personally with invitation card.14 schools, 28 students - teachers, guardians ... we were ready for a good community representation in NSS Day function at Netaji auditorium. Would they finally come or feel scared? Some of the guardians work as daily labourer inside IIT campus. Might have worked in the lawn around that Netaji auditorium where convocation function is held and IITians receive their coveted degree. And we planned certificate of appreciation for these village kids for their good academic performance (no matter that it is village school) and prizes to be handed over by Director, IIT Khargpur - even I as a child could not dreamt of such a thing. And we must thank, feel grateful that the whole of IIT Admin. - Director, Deputy Director, Deans, all  lent all kind of support. S.D.O. Kharagpur said that he would come directly from Kharagpur after a meeting. The atmosphere was filled with positive vibration.The responsibilities of each program officer (P.O.) for the function were fixed beforehand. We had three meetings in 7 days for that. I must say that I have got an excellent team of faculty colleagues taking the responsibility of NSS officers. The meeting took us back to our college days. Since mid-sem was going on we had to put little extra effort on our part. But all of us enjoyed it. Prof SH and his team of volunteers managed the stage, sequence of events in a 90 minute packed program comprising of various segments like a professional. More importantly, they had to get it first time right with no prior stage rehearsal. Prof SSD, another P.O. was given the responsibility of announcements in stage, integration of various segments. Mr MR, P.O. would take care of food. Other P.O.s will take care of volunteer assignment at IIT Gates, ppt preparation, reception of guest, audience management etc. Myself and Prof. PKB were given the role of coordination as our cell no.s were given to various guests and if they were stuck up somewhere might call us for help. There was a setback when Prof. SSD became unavailable as he had to attend some medical emergency. In the 23rd meeting it was decided that I would be his substitute for on stage announcements. I never had an experience of addressing 1000 capacity crowd or socials like these. Neither I am a good orator (you may find that in the NSS Day video). For a while we thought a student volunteer to do the job. Then we thought it is the first show of its kind and IITkgp student audience has its own tantrums. It may be difficult for a volunteer who is either from 1st or 2nd year to maintain command. May be in our next public program in National Youth Week (Jan. 12-19, 2011) they will be more prepared.We personally met Director, Deputy Director, Deans, Registrar and kept them apprised of the NSS Day events. Twice we circulated it in institute group mail.  (To be continued. Draft)"},

It seems that I missed the following July 04, 2010 report due to summer vacation pressure :-) There was one. I went invisible in google too to avoid any ping. Shall talk about that later. I was on the facebook page of an NGO where I saw a connection to this thread. It reveals some startling facts.India has possibly the largest number of active non-government, not-for-profit organizations in the world. A recent study commissioned by the government put the number of such entities, accounted for till 2009, at 3.3 million. That is one NGO for less than 400 Indians, and many times the number of primary schools and primary health centres in India.That too is a conservative estimate according to http://www.indianexpress.com/news/first-official-estimate-an-ngo-for-every-40/643302/Isn't that great? One NGO if on average has 10 members, the ratio becomes 1:40. Besides we have GOs - schools, health centres to top up (since the NGO number is larger). Our population must be getting great care. Let us see how they are financed.While the government will begin studying the finances of the sector in the second phase of the survey, estimates from within the sector suggest that NGOs, or NPIs, raise anywhere between Rs 40,000 crore and Rs 80,000 crore in funding annually. ... Individual donors are emerging as the biggest and most lucrative source of funds. According to an internal study by a leading foreign NGO headquartered in the UK, donations by individuals are expected to have grown from around Rs 2,200 crore in 2005 to Rs 8,100 crore by a conservative estimate, and to around Rs 21,000 crore (in 2009) by more liberal estimates.That is lot of money. It requires audit of both types. The one according to financial norms. The other is the social audit. The community for which donation is made should know the amount donated, work done; the donor in turn should get report of utilization of fund and actual outcomes. Is that happening? Our little exposure to underdeveloped area do not say that. On the contrary we see high rise building of NGO officials  with marble floors, air-conditioned vehicles and there are advertisements of 'lucrative' NGO jobs in various campus. Indian Express report leaves a hint.“The government study included, these are all broad estimates. Nobody really knows the ground reality because this sector has grown very fast in the past many years. Besides, there have been no efforts to maintain an official database or even to encourage such entities to be transparent about their activities as well as fundings,” said Soumitro Ghosh, founder CEO, CSO Partners, a Chennai-based organization set up to encourage transparency in the functioning of the sector.The effort of Mr. Ghosh is laudable. But often the NGOs use the umbrage that they are so much burdened with their 'social service' work that this accounting, keeping records etc. becomes an extra burden. And there are bigger plots too as has been mentioned in a follow up article of Indian Express dated Aug. 17, 2010. It also gives further clarification on financial aspect.According to various estimates, in 2009, around Rs 18,000 crore (of total Rs. 80000 crore) came in from the government, around Rs 10,000 crore were generated through foreign contributions, Rs 1,600-2,000 crore were raised through religious contributions and the rest (~ Rs. 50000 crore) through corporate and individual donations.These are big numbers. And Mr. Ghosh rightly says, “The point is that if India, indeed, had 3-4 million NGOs, whatever amount of funds they may be raising, by the sheer amount of work they would do, we will not have the kind of social problems that we are currently faced with.”A few days back when we (a team of NSS officers) were visiting a few Sarva Shiksha Kendra we happened to meet an NGO official in a Panchayat Office. He said, \"I requested you to join us or at least visit our NGO. You asked one of our volunteer about audit statements. It was not ready at that time. I understand why you said that. Most of the NGOs are in money-making business. We are not like that. We care for the people.\" To hear that from an NGO official right at the heart of a village means a lot.I shall end this post with the opening statement of this second Indian Express report. It shows that money is not the issue. A professionally managed, transparent organization who really care for the people is the need of the hour. That organization need not even touch any money and can simply serve as an integrating force of various well meaning NGO and GO efforts. To do that one needs to have a balanced development of 3 'H' : Heart - to feel, Head - to plan, Hand - to execute. Donating money is the easiest thing to do and usually that comes first to our mind when we think about our social responsibility. Often people play on that tender feelings, show images of poverty, lack of facilities etc. for collecting money. We donate and think that our job is done. But as this report says, that is not enough. We have to have a system in place, if it does not exist, we need to create a one. We need to visit the places ourselves, first time may be with the help of NGO. After that on our own and check the progress. We have read that in a well run kingdom, the king used to mix with people like a commoner and find out their problems, how they are benefited from  development schemes etc.. If he visited with royal entourage the truth would not have been revealed.I think that a significant number of iitians possess these qualities (3 'H'). With a strong 'IIT' brand and stronger alumni network we can surely take a lead here. That will be one excellent gift to the nation, our 'Bharat' which often is treated differentially with 'India' and talked about in various circles. The endnote from the newspaper article.It is surprising that while India has one of the largest number of active not-for-profit, non-government organisations, most global donor agencies and voluntary agencies lament that they do not find enough “eligible partners” to work with. “We fund only around 250 NGOs in India. Finding professional, above board organisations that will follow transparent ways of functioning is a challenge (here),” says Nisha Agarwal, CEO, Oxfam India, a US-based organisation that mainly raises and donates funds to grassroots agencies. Oxfam’s funding budget for 2009 was Rs 90 crore."},

{"title": "Teacher's Day", "date": "Sunday, September 12, 2010", "text": "Last week attended three Teacher's Day function and got connected to the fourth in an indirect way for some awkward reason.The first one attended was on 5th Sept. itself which was Sunday this year. Students of two local schools (Atulmani and Silver Jubilee) assembled at a hall in Golebazar, Durgamandir. The Headmaster of Atulmani school presided. The Principal of Ramakrishna Mission School at Midnapore Town, Swami Sunishthanandaji was the main speaker. The theme of this morning three hour assembly was \"Towards Life Building\". There were few guardians too. I spoke a little about what can be called success and how important it is to enjoy what one is doing, the importance of good health, sports and games and also participated in Q & A sessions. The second one was on 6th Sept. evening, organized by MTech. students of Telecommunication specialization of our Dept. I was touched by the way students organized the function and made teachers feel special. It was not something arranged just for the sake of it. Teachers shared experiences of their students life. When my turn came I preferred to speak on our role in nation building process, that united we are a great force, IITKGP is the first of the IITs starting from a place where freedom fighters were detained, can be the first to show how brand IIT can be used for community service etc. and the discussion continued even after the function was formally over.The third one was held on 7th Sept. at Kalidas Auditorium. This was arranged by students of Advanced VLSI Lab. and it was a cultural extravaganza. The play (a comedy) was superb, particularly one character, Gourhari the poet looked fully immersed and there was no visible effort from him to act, all came so natural. IITians are truly multi-faceted and are full of talent. Incidentally, a group NSS volunteers belonging to NSS cultural team staged a street-play on 4t Sept. in a nearby village on atrocities against woman. Congrats to you all - for you the world is so very beautiful!Now the fourth one! I wish I could avoid this but wish to speak as greatness is all about direction no matter what the current state is. On 8th Sept., one senior Prof. asked me to help drafting something (so that it does not appear harsh) which will be shared with all teachers (very very few attended the function) and students. The quality of the 5th Sept., 'official' Tecaher's Day program organized by Rxxx/Gxxx (?) at Netaji Auditorium perhaps has scope for improvement. I do not know for sure as the students were selective in invitation, may be found it difficult to reach all faculty members, we are too many now :-) or there could be simply communication gap. I could attend 'this' function a few years back and found it would be more apt to call it a \"Student Day\" function. However, I respect the organizing committee's wish and freedom as much as I respect mine and they are entitled to hold it in the way they like and pay their 'tribute' to teachers."},
{"title": "Remembering", "date": "Thursday, September 9, 2010", "text": "Baba (Father). Today is his death anniversary. The 1992 appears to be yesterday. It was at about 10 a.m. in the morning. After a night out at hospital I came to our railway quarter (near Bara Maszid at Golebazar) for a quick snack. On return to Railway hospital, my elder sister was found weeping on the stairs. A fighter who stood like a big protecting rock before us, sheltered many like a big eagle under the wings, called it a day. Around 2 p.m. the mortal frame was brought in our quarter. The playground in front of our quarter was almost mobbed - young and old, paying homage to a person who was really larger than life. The playground still exists between Maszid and Cooperative Stores, our quarter was the middle one numbered MQ9/8. The block was popularly called adhai (2.5) number because it had one bedroom, one verandah which we converted to room by curtain, kitchen, store room, toilet - a total space of 2.5 bedroom.The partition of India brought the family in a place called Bandel in Hooghly District of West Bengal as refugee. An otherwise good student Baba had to abandon study after secondary when his elder brother and then my grandfather died in quick succession. There was a large family to feed, used to be joint family those days. And Baba perhaps was found to be more capable, competent and he took up the responsibility. Tried a few self-employment ventures which didn't work out that well. Then, he could establish a shop which started generating some revenue. Together with a few fellow shopkeepers in the neighbourhood he used to bring materials from Kihdirpore dock of Kolkata in truck. That was a trying time for India as a nation with problems galore specially in states like Bengal with large number of refugees coming in. Baba was the most educated in the family at that time! My other uncle (they were three brothers) was finding it difficult to adapt in a new environment and so did cousin brothers who were a few years younger to Baba. They abandoned study much earlier. It was a bold but important decision for Baba to introduce cousin brothers to that shop and open two more shops (small ones though) in two nearby places, one near Bandel station and the other next to then very famous Dunlop factory (tyre, tube). But it needed a steady cash flow at least in the initial years. He tried and got a railway clerical job but at Kharagpur, almost 5 hours from Bandel. From 1960 to 1970 he stayed in a mess in a place called Kharida (parallel to Giri Maidan Halt station) and on the weekend he visited Bandel and helped run those shops, maintaining accounts and teaching the youngsters and they got slowly established. My mother's side is from West Bengal. Those days there was lot of animosity between people of West Bengal and refugees coming from East Bengal. However, in a local temple my paternal grandmother and maternal grandmother got friendly and decided to tie the knot. Also, one of my maternal uncles and my father played soccer together in a local club. That also helped in removing the difference. Ma (Mother) studied up to class VII. Ironically, she got double promotion in Class V. Those were the ages when in such a family study up to class VII used to be considered enough. If a girl studies a lot, it might become difficult to get a suitable groom for her who has to be more educated. Even now can a groom accept a bride who is more qualified - the male ego or peer pressure will come in the way. The marriage took place in 1960 soon after Baba got the railway job.I was born in 1968 in Bandel, Hooghly only. In 1970, my father got a railway quarter in a place called Nimpura. That is when we all came at Kharagpur - Ma, my two elder sisters and of course little me, one year old. We shifted to railway quarter MQ9/8 near Golebazar after a few years and was there till father died and we had to move out. I have a few faint images of Nimpura quarter but MQ9/8 is very much livid, perhaps I know every square inch of it - twenty prime years of life - schooling, IIT undergraduate days, first employment, more importantly the lovely childhood was associated with that.The accommodation provided is a function of designation and seniority and not the need. However, the positivity my parents always carried with themselves never made us find fault with anyone or anything. We enjoyed every moment of our stay. Baba used to be philosopher, guide to many of our extended family (not only from Bandel) who came from East Pakistan. Almost every weekend we used to find Baba going to some of their places to solve some problem or they coming to our quarter.  As a child I used to have a lot of fun with the visitors and invariably forced them to play chess with me, my favourite indoor sport. Else I was a kind of soccer addict, got into blood from Baba perhaps.  In fact, one office colleague of Baba, Bhabananda uncle used to come to teach my two elder sisters. I eagerly waited for the tuition to end and as soon as it was over used all the tricks to make him play chess with me. Remember playing chess with Baba in between two Class X board exams.Ma was detected to have a tumor when I was about 8-9 years. My maternal uncles used to come and take her to Bandel for treatment and she used to be there for weeks. Initially homeopathy was tried and finally it was operated on in R.G. Kar Hospital at Kolkata. The whole exercise took more than a year. On every occasion Ma left Kharagpur I used to think perhaps that was the last time I would be able to see her and used to cry a lot. Was not in a position to understand the gravity of the disease and at that time the word 'operation' was fearsome to all. Baba not only provided all the support but also prepared food for us, did office work and helped us study in the evening. His teaching was enough for me till Class VIII. In Class IX-X, I took one tuition that too for Additional Math. In Class XI-XII too Baba helped in Bengali and English. In those two years, one private tutor taught Math and Physics and the other Chemistry - in 2+2=4 slots in a week. The rest was available for self-study and soccer and reading storybooks.It is not that Baba prevented me from taking tuition, rather I didn't find the need. As I grew up a little, I realized the hardship behind maintaining the family from a lower division clerical job. It was not there was any complaint though. After getting monthly salary, to the tune of Rs. 100-120 (in seventies it was much more valued than today but not princely either)  he used to write it in a notebook (saw these numbers there). Every expense thereof was to be noted there religiously and the balance was there always at bottom to show how much was left for the month. I used to get one set of dresses from him during Durga Puja that used to be school uniform. But whenever we visited our extended family members, my mother used to collect the old but in good-condition dresses of the elder cousin brothers. There was nothing like feeling insulted. Wealth and degree perhaps bring with it many vices - foremost the ego, we feel humiliated/insulted for almost everything. Anyways, I could feel there was no point in putting a financial burden on Baba unless absolutely required. As such Bhabananda uncle used to come to teach elder sisters who were a few classes ahead. I used to sit quietly by my sisters' side never disturbing them waiting for chess play to begin and also absorbing what he was teaching. Later my sisters used to ask me to repeat what they were taught and often they said that it became more comprehensible after I reran the entire stuff.Then came the momentous decision of 1984. After Class X, Baba asked me to switch over to English medium so that I can appear for IIT-JEE. Having studied in Bengali medium throughout in Railway School (near flyover at the entry of Golebazar) I found the going very tough. He bought a book of Physics written by Dutta, Pal, Chowdhury. The first day it took almost 30-45 minutes to read a single page. Baba was beside me with a dictionary. Whenever I came across a new word, I tossed it towards him and he would give me the meaning. This was the period between Class X board exam. and taking admission into Class XI. A part of this period was spent in a lodge in Vellore. One of our relatives had kidney problem and was to be stationed there for treatment for more than a year. Other relatives took turns to be by his side and a roster was prepared. Our turn came after my Class X board exam. and we spent one month there in a lodge in Vellore, called 'Swami Lodge' near CMC hospital. I can remember the lodge charge of 1984. Single room Rs. 7 per day for two (cooking in the corridor or inside that room) and for every extra person it was Rs. 2 per day per person. Even then that lodge and similar lodges were full of patients and their relatives. A different kind of community feelings existed among all bereaved waiting for a healing touch. The CMC hospital's ambiance was divine. We three - my father, my mother, me used to lie on the floor of the single room hired and our relatives - the patient and his brother used the cot. Became friendly with family members of other patients. I got very close to a north-Indian family where there were 4 members. The father in fifties had a problem with his esophagus and could not swallow food and there was a pipe inserted in stomach. Time to time he was given liquid diet through that pipe and he moved around like that. There was always a smile on his face. One seldom finds a positive frame of mind like him even in a healthy young person. With him came his son, wife and a monk (in red robes not saffron clad) who was the brother-in-law and came as a support to help sister. Like the son I used to call the monk 'Mamu'. We used to play marble in the long corridor of the lodge and Mamu was very good, always won maybe due to his meditative mind. Mamu took my father's permission and I went to watch two movies in the local cinema hall with them during that period - one Telugu, one Hindi. Till that time my visits to cinema halls were way below double digit. Baba used to be very strict on that count. He always encouraged me in sports and games, reading story books but cinema was a strict 'No-No'. I told Baba that it was not possible for me to switch over to English medium with that pace of study. One subject book of Class XI itself is 5 times the size of Class X English text book that I managed somehow. Then there was Class XII part and other subjects too. But Baba encouraged and perhaps did the greatest of the underwriting job one could imagine in that situation. Underwriting means risk-taking which the bank does acting as a guarantor taking risk of a business for a premium. But they bet on X no. and even if 0.1X fails they are on the profit due to premiums collected from all X and there too it is done on public money as public limited company with limited liability. Here it is his own son, only son. Needs tremendous courage, foresight. I saw Baba's diary after his death. Though irregular and cryptic he used to maintain diary in his beautiful handwriting (any day he beats me a dozen to nil only on handwriting itself).  In one place he writes about me when I was five years old, \"... will go a long way if cared well.\" He had faith in me. I had not in myself. Therefore, I said, \"If you force me, I shall take English medium but I am sure to fail.\" He said, \"You try then let us see how you can fail.\" To this I said, \"I don't care if I fail. Hope you will not be embarrassed if neighbours/relatives say that Sahababu's son who did well in Class X has failed in Class XII.\" He said unhesitatingly, \"Not at all. Go ahead.\" This courage, this straight talking, this taking life as it comes, I learnt from him and also from studying Vivekananda. When I was in Class III, a few young college students started a small organization near our place patronized by Baba and a few of his colleagues. Every afternoon we used to assemble in a nearby playground called B.N.R ground (comes from Bengal Nagpur Railway, the earlier name of South Eastern Railway) behind Maszid. There was prayer followed by a few quotes from Vivekananda which we had to memorize and speak in turn, followed by P.T., Soccer, then final assembly, prayer and return home. Once a week we used to have study circles. Occasionally we used to have camps which usually were housed in one of the Ramakrishna Mission Centers. When I grew up, I used to take care of children similar to the care we received in our childhood.So, continued with the English medium. As said, I took two tuition teachers who taught in 2+2 slots. Baba repeatedly asked if I needed more teachers as there was none to take care of Biology, English, Bengali the other three subjects. The Math. too was taught by the Physics teacher who clearly said that he was not a Math. teacher per se but can help a little if we wanted. The tuition fee of Physics+Math teacher was Rs. 60 per month. The fee of the Chemistry teacher was Rs. 75 per month. He gave Rs. 25 discount once visiting our quarter and asked me not to disclose that to other students. I found self-study suited me more and kept my slots free so that there was no clash with soccer practice and the organization related work. To change medium to English, I got admitted to then famous Hijli High School, inside IIT campus. We were not aware that there was a change in leadership in the school from that year and a section of the teachers who had personal ambitions were trying to humiliate the new Headmaster by disrupting the school activities. A section of the local guardians also contributed who found that their wards might get better and personal care if these set of otherwise competent teachers were used. It was shocking to see some of the school teachers giving private tuition during class hours to a few school students just outside the school campus. We 7-8 from Golebazar, railway area, previously in Railway school, only used to be there in the class. And some of the serious teachers who used to be present in the school lost interest and we were left to fend for ourselves. Up to Class X, I had seen teachers who were good or not-so-good in teaching. But there never was any attempt to ruin the lives of the students. One very competent and very renowned in Kharagpur was our English teacher at Hijli school. In two years, he took only one English class that too in first week or so. He taught the poem 'Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead' so well in the only class he took. Next week he surprised us by coming to Bengali class and asked the Bengali teacher to make room from him. The teacher was quite surprised by his colleague's behavior but to avoid a scene before students and knowing that he was less powerful left the class. The English teacher taught 'Naisha Abhiyan', a piece of Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyaya and it was an excellent presentation. But he never taught any class thereafter in school and in school hours used to give private tuition. Later somebody educated me that those two classes were promo to show how good he was in both the subjects and students should join his private tuition. I knew that Baba would be disturbed if I said all these and as such, he might have a feeling that he could do more than those two tuitions. In Hijli school, I started spending hours in library and attended the school full-time to tell Baba \"Ell is well\" while most of the students attended only practical and a few classes of some 'strict' teachers. The Class XI half-yearly exam. result was out. I averaged 60 percent. The change in medium had its effect but I was slowly getting adapted to.This was the time when I was in Class XI, Baba once came to Patel Hall of IITkgp campus. I accompanied. There was a son of Railway employee studying Chemical Engineering there. He studied in Purulia Ramakrishna Mission and then Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission - Mecca of Secondary and Higher Secondary education in West Bengal. We met him. Baba asked how to prepare for IIT-JEE. Given our situation he advised a one-year correspondence course called 'Agrawal Classes'. As we were about to return there was a smile on his face. Baba inquired. He said, \"Uncle, many have asked me this before and I have given this suggestion. But my experience is - everyone begins but a few ends.\" After that Baba ensured that I finish Agrawal Lessons, tasks in time and if there is a clash with school exam. I give priority to the former. I remember that I was busy finishing these lessons when there was Test Exam. (was considered very important before Class XII Board Exam.) and studied only in the morning for the day exam. and did not score a great average. I was and am still grateful to two of my classmates who helped me at that time. The fee for this correspondence course was Rs. 800. We decided to share the lessons and booklets and each of us had to pay only one-third. And there never was any conflict in sharing the resources at any point in time. Baba, too appreciated their and their guardians' kind gesture.Then came the D-Days. Publication of results of various exam.s IIT-JEE, 10+2 Board, WB-JEE engineering and medical. Appeared in these three. I had the habit of not looking at how much have been answered, what could be the probable marks. Used to get rid of whole of it when an exam.is over and it was time to hit the soccer field. Baba, unlike many other guardians, encouraged this. He used to ask us to work hard and not to worry about results - to be prepared for whatever comes. I find a correlation in Vivekananda quote - \"Spit out your action, good or bad and be Azad (free).\" Accordingly, I inquired into local Kharagpur College (on way to NH-6 from Inda, left hand side) and was preparing myself what to do next in General stream if result was not good. None in the family, including Baba seemed worried at all and it was days as usual. At first, IIT-JEE result was published, it was a Sunday. That evening we returned from Bandel. Could have returned in the morning. But the feeling was - \"What's the hurry, result will be there in the IIT notice board next day too and it is not going to change. Let's maximize our stay in Bandel and spend time with relatives, cousin brothers and sisters and have fun.\"Next day at about 9 a.m. Baba asked me to go to IIT and check the result. From Golebazar it is about 5+5 = 10 KM of cycling. So, I first decided to check with one class-mate who too appeared in IIT-JEE and stayed within 1 KM at a different side of railway area. He may be able to give an overview at least who from Kharagpur town got chance. If my name did not figure it would save my energy of cycling all the way to IIT and I could be back to my other business - organization (http://abvym.org) related work, reading fictions etc. quickly. There was no television at our residence. There was a 1960 model valve operated (no semiconductor) radio which my mother got as a gift during marriage. My friend was standing at the door of their quarter and there were 3-4 more batch-mates there. There was a pal of gloom around. Joined the conversation. Felt it awkward to ask my result when they themselves did not figure in the list. But again, is it worth cycling all the distance? After sometime asked, \"How did KGP town fared as a whole in IIT-JEE?\" The answer came, \"A few - you, ...., ...\" \"Any idea on my rank?\" \"Not sure, may be towards the end 1300 or so.\" At that time the number of seats were less and 1300 was used to be considered as bottom. Anyways, I found reason enough to cycle to IIT. The notice was there in the Main Building in front of F-127 noticeboards. The place has not changed much from 1986 to 2010. I was sweetly surprised to see an AIR of 224. The first thought that came to my mind was that Baba will no longer caution me if I give more time to play or organization related work. With an IIT stamp I'll get at least a decent number of private tuitions (if not anything better) and now I can have a carefree life. Though I spent a great amount of time in EAA (Extra Academic Activity) there was always a fear. When I was about 13-14, Baba one day called me and said, \"I want to tell you something very frankly. You perhaps understand our financial condition. I am confident that I'd save enough to get your two elder sisters married. From my provident fund (PF) I expect to build a small house. Myself and your mother will be able to maintain ourselves from whatever railway pension we shall get. I shall not leave you any burden of the family. But I shall not be able to leave any wealth for you. I shall try the hardest to make you study as much as you want but that's the most that I can do for you.\" I kept quiet. All that I understood at that tender age was that I must study well and this is the only path.The family was very happy. After a few weeks WB-JEE result was out. Engineering rank was 141 and Medical 208. Baba wanted me to join Medical. Ma wanted Engineering. It was left to me. As soon as secondary (class X) exam. was over Baba asked me to go to Bandel alone, my first in life. He asked, \"Now you start handling things yourself.\" Admission to Hijli School etc. was all done by me. Baba never came. So, the wishes of Baba and Ma were subtle. I decided IIT because it was close to home and the EAA activities could be continued with. After a few weeks of class at IIT the date of publication of Class XII Board exam. was announced. I started feeling nervous. What if I get back i.e. fail in one subject! The sense of security in me, in the family will all vanish. Somebody told that once upon a time even after admission in IIT one got back in English and he had to discontinue.At that time 10+2 West Bengal Board results used to come in what was called \"Gazette\". This was a printed booklet. Local youths used to collect it from Kolkata after a lot of effort (there used to be tremendous rush and long queue) and brought it to their locals. All students/guardians used to flock to him and there was differential fee - highest for 1st division, 2nd highest for 2nd division and so on. People often used to cross-check in another gazette in a nearby locality where another youth were offering the service at a similar fee. The mark sheet used to come to schools much later. Finally, the result was published. The local senior who brought the gazette put me on his shoulder and took me around and there was a big crowd in front of our quarter. My name appeared in the daily newspaper as 14th ranker in 10+2 Board Exam. Baba took me to Kolkata to receive an award from then Chief Minister Jyoti Basu. I attended two more functions and after that Baba turned down all the requests. One of the functions was for being first in Midnapore District (then East and West Midnapore were combined), the other one was at Hijli High School. The Hijli School function was hilarious and I'll narrate that on some other occasion. Baba even requested his office colleagues to abandon the idea of felicitating me. He said, \"Too many of these will make him (i.e. me) forget that miles to go and he will start thinking that he has become something (he was pointing to ego)\" and they agreed but came to our quarter and gave many prizes. I remember Baba's office colleagues - Pradhan Jyethu, Bera Mama, Mukherjee Kaku, Haldar Kaku, Datta Mama, Anjan Kaku, Goswami Kaku and many such names. When I came first in Class I exam. Pradhan Jyethu told me, \"Now that you came first, you cannot be second anymore.\" His wish (by virtue of blessings from all) were true in school life. Up to XII, I stood first in school exam.s, surprisingly in Hijli School too even after scoring low marks after medium change came first as the other toppers focussed mostly on IIT-JEE and other JEEs and did not stress on WB Board exam./syllabi. In IITkgp, ECE Dept. there were the likes of Ranjit Gharpurey, K Srikanth, Sridhar and I was fortunate to end BTech program joint third with Sridhar, behind former two. All my batchmates were great. Somehow, I managed to do sufficiently well in Exam.s in spite of being one of the least interactive students. The problem was that my knowledge of English medium was limited to written English and I could not speak English and Hindi was not at all allowed. Preferred to be backbencher hiding face avoiding interaction so that I didn't need to speak. In the class too didn't interact much with 'toppers' who used to speak in English and was closer to those few who had communication problem like me. Goswami Kaku always supplied me story books, children's magazine 'Anandamela' from my early years. The newspaper uncle too was very kind. He knew that I liked to read story books but it was difficult for Baba to subscribe to children's magazines. Whenever a new issue of another popular children's magazine 'Shuktara' was published he delivered one copy first in our quarter and next day he used to collect that and give it to original subscriber. A few hours used to be enough for me to finish a magazine. Yes, such requirements, boundary conditions perhaps made me a fast reader. I used to take approx. half the time or even less to read a single page compared to an ordinary reader. Perhaps this is one example of how weakness can be turned into one's strength.Everything was going fine like a fairy tale story and it could have ended with \"they lived happily thereafter.\" It was not to be. I was completing my 2nd year at Dept. of E&ECE & Patel Hall at IIT Kharagpur. It was 1988. Baba was feeling some health-related problems - mostly high blood pressure and a pain that used to start from the heel and moved upward. With a strong physique and stronger frame of mind he initially ignored them - then tried homeopathy, local allopathy and yoga in that order. He always made us feel that he was relatively better in each treatment while the ground reality was different. It could be so that entire life he solved others' problems  and now he does not want others to feel troubled because of him. It could be so that the problem existed for long and he hid it so that I remain focused to academics in those crucial years. In our railway quarter there used to be an acute shortage of water supply. It was a routine affair that we used to stand, often in a long queue, before the nearest well which was 150m away inside the Maszid. The Maszid authority was magnanimous and never felt irritated or turned us away. I remember Halim uncle and others. We never had any trouble in that area even after Ram Janmabhumi-Babri Maszid episode. While myself and Baba used to fetch water on ordinary days, it used to be sole responsibility of Baba when I used to have academic deadlines. After that operation of Ma, Baba increased his share of responsibility in household work and tried to assist her as much as possible. Every morning he used to chop vegetables or fish and at times used to cook a few items. He was a great cook, especially the chicken preparations were very delicious. Whenever there was any visitor in our house, we used to have chicken dishes and it was Baba's responsibility. Now if he raised his own health issue then the equilibrium would have been lost and the system he had been painstakingly building since his refugee days, reaching some sort of stability, would have been out of gear. I mentioned the kind of help he used to be to one and all. It perhaps was unbecoming of him to send a distress call, otherwise too, people around in our lower middle-class family, themselves were quite unstable.My Ma finally persuaded him to go to Vellore, CMC. A maternal uncle accompanied. On their return we were lightning struck to hear that both the kidneys were at a late stage of failure. Then and before too he never looked like a patient. He scoffed off his disease. He never believed in too much talking or democracy, at least in his own matters. He spared only a few sentences when we confronted him. He said that he obtained all necessary info. from CMC physicians and did adequate research. He continued, \"Post 50 years the kidney transplantation is risky, maximum survival years is 9-10. And there were cases that people died in operation table. Average survival year is 4. The physicians said that if I take medicines and control food-water, lifestyle then I shall survive for 3-4 years. Therefore, I opt for the second and shall be taking medicine, food as prescribed. All of you get busy with our respective work. Nothing to discuss, debate or worry about me.\" We all understood that behind his research he concealed the effort required for kidney transplantation - money, time, energy, involvement of people. But in our family, he always had the last word, none could ever rise above his personality. He could have been just a clerk in a railway office, it was common for us to often see railway staff in Howrah station saluting him when we changed platform from South Eastern Railway (Kharagpur trains) to Eastern Railway (Bandel trains). The physique, the look, the long strides, there was always an aura around him. The last time he got admitted into hospital (three weeks before he left us) was 14th August, 1992. It was the emergency section of Railway Main Hospital at Kharagpur. Myself and two of my friends accompanied him. The doctor at emergency thought one of my friends to be patient. A terminally ill kidney patient with abysmally low hemoglobin level never looked like one. Baba intervened and said, \"I am the patient. Please admit me. Dr. Dora (senior doctor) knows my case. Please inform him.\" The junior doctor was surprised. The next day was Independence Day. The night in the hospital emergency was different from other years. That time and otherwise too when Baba was in hospital, we faced one difficulty. Either I or one of my friends used to be there at night to take care of his needs, to take him to the toilet etc. He used to make all effort so that we feel comfortable, lie down somewhere, take sleep and unless we were awake, he would go to toilet alone without calling us.We never saw any worry in the period 1988-1992 in his face or any fear of death. It was business as usual for him - visiting the office, shops, taking morning walks and of course what he always did best, guiding people. Many of my friends depended more on Baba's advice than their own guardians. I remember how Baba encouraged one of my school friends who did not do too well in academics to open a book shop and now in Kharagpur town he perhaps is the most famous and he has chain of shops not only in Kharagpur, but in other places too. He used to bring books and copies from Kolkata by train and kept them in our quarter in the evening. Their own residence was far and on the upper floor and the books and copies used to be quite heavy. Next morning, he used to take them to his shop. Often, I accompanied him to various nearby schools promoting his enterprise and talked to school teachers. There were many other examples. I remember three of my distant relatives who got railway jobs in Kharagpur stayed in our small quarter for weeks and months. Two of them were male and shifted after 3-4 weeks when Baba could find a good accommodation for them as a local guardian. For the third it was difficult to get a mess for her and D.... Masi stayed in our quarter longer. There never was any complaint from any of my parents and they were happy to play their part of the role. D... Masi, her husband S... Meso, their daughters maintain such a cordial relation with us even today which is seldom found even in near relatives. The bond that is built on sharing, care and love are the greatest. I used to get a lot of affection from many for simply being son of 'Sahababu', admired by one and all.All that I could do in this period was to stay close to Baba and he appeared to be proud of that. The CGPA was good (9.68), there were 'good' offers from India and abroad. Didn't look at any of them. The nearest 'good' offer was from Tata Steel, Jamshedpur that had relatively easy 18 months of G.T. Training akin to IAS training with adventure sports, one month of Management Training at XLRI, Jamshedpur etc. Opted for that. I used to come to KGP on the weekend and also on holidays. Found a novel way to maximize stay at KGP. Every three months, on Friday morning we used to go to Jamshedpur Blood Bank, donate blood, get rest for that day and next day off. Soon after blood donation I used to rush to Tatanagar Station and took Bombay-Howrah Express (now Shalimar-KurlaT Express) to come to KGP. Once training period was over, met General Manager (Works) and by his advice Executive Director of Tata Steel and pleaded for my posting at Tata Bearings, Kharagpur. They tried to make me understand that my career will bloom in their main plants and not in a small division like Tata Bearings and in the past none of Jamshedpur G.T. had come here. Also, that they took over this plant from a company called 'Metal Box' and there was no Tata culture yet there. Still, I persuaded them and they reluctantly posted me here at KGP.  In between I tried for a Kolkata position in ANZ Grindlays Bank (now merged with Standard Charter Bank); KGP always is better connected with Kolkata than Tatanagar. I did well in the written exam. so much so that the big shot in the interview asked me to join their Head Office at Bombay, foreign training after a few months and almost double the salary from what I was getting from Tata Steel and said that Kolkata job is too low key and did not fit my profile. I said that I could not go to Bombay for personal reasons. The big boss thought that I was bargaining. He offered me free accommodation; his deputies echoed that boss does not provide acco. to a new incumbent and it was a rare gesture and I should accept the offer. Then I told them that my father was terminally ill and I wanted to stay close. They rightly said that there were better medical facilities in Mumbai. I replied that Baba periodically visits CMC, Vellore and he insisted to spend the remaining period amongst friends and families and he was not the kind to listen to others. To this the boss said, \"We value your sentiment. But sometimes you have to take hard decisions in life.\" I replied, \"I am taking one in rejecting your generous offer.\" Then the boss said, \"I was to return to Bombay by evening flight. I am postponing that to tomorrow. Please go back home. Discuss our offer with your father. I am sure he will guide you to join us. Please meet us tomorrow at 10 a.m. and confirm our offer.\" I returned home. Baba asked how the test was. I said, \"It was okay but they prefer some other people for the post advertized.\" (Only the Kolkata post was advertized) and did not discuss any other point with father and let the offer collapse. Baba never believed in astrology, stones etc. We have our family deity Ma Raksha Kali. Once a year we have a big Puja at Bandel with all family members converging in. Baba used to say \"as Ma Kali wishes\". In my 2nd Year of IIT UG days a black and white Uptron TV was bought. Baba preferred comedy movies. Among serious movies he was moved by 'Meghe Dhaka Tara' by Ritwik Ghatak. It portrays the difficulties faced by a refugee family of East Pakistan and how the eldest member of the family sacrificed her life to stabilize the ship. He saw it a number of times. He used to read newspapers thoroughly and had a strong understanding of the contemporary world. He did not have much fascination with fiction (my mother had and still has). He liked reading 'Ramakrishna Kathamrita' in hospital days. He was to retire from job in 1994. By 1988, before the disease was detected he prepared a plan for a small 2-bedroom house in the small plot of land we had in Bandel. He planned to stay there after retirement among other relatives. But could not proceed further due to onset of disease and did not see retirement either. A few days before he died, he asked me to come close when I was alone in hospital and others were away. He had difficulty talking at that time. Whispered to me, \"Please get married. Take care of yourself. In this world, no one takes care of others. One has to take care of himself\" I understood the first part, its origin. I used to be busy with our organization related work of Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal and at times used to be in company of monks. But the second part of the advice weather was specific to me, that I trusted people easily or were too innocent for this complex world or the ideology I believed in originated from divine nature of people or something to do with his vast long struggle in life that asks son who till date had been protected by him to be aware of realities on ground, was not very clear. May be he was indicating that the sacrifice one makes often is not reciprocated and one should be strong enough to accept that and be prepared for that or it may be something more subtle, to come from him who always believed in taking care of others and never bothering to take care of himself - may be that we are all one, the idea of taking care of others is incorrect, we take care of ourselves only else it is no care if we do not feel the oneness; at the same time it is not necessary that everyone will have the same feelings and the gesture will be reciprocated as we all are at different stages of evolution. The fulfillment of the wish and the house at Bandel according to his design - both happened in 1998. I continued to believe in the ideology that human beings are essentially divine, the animal nature is just an aberration but tried to fortify myself by expecting the unexpected. I still trust people easily. At the same time, I learnt to become independent. If somebody does some good to me, I feel grateful, if acts differently I don't feel surprised because life's struggle of Baba has left behind a lesson - absorb all negatives, be always positive, make others feel positive, don't look for return, stand on your own feet and own the responsibility.Baba, accept my pranam. Make me a worthy son of thee.\"Let us rise up and be thankful, for if we didn't learn a lot today, at least we learned a little, and if we didn't learn a little, at least we didn't get sick, and if we got sick, at least we didn't die; so, let us all be thankful.\" - Goutam BuddhaConcluded(Draft)..."},
{"title": "Unlearning", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2010", "text": "We need to unlearn a lot of things as all that we get to 'learn' may make our vision narrow. A wider experience of life - what it is, what it is leading to...a well rounded development makes a much better decision maker, much better human being out of me. K. V. Kamath, Chairman, ICICI Bank in a recent interview at CNBC-TV18---Q: Going back to your college days, you graduated from the Karnataka Regional Engineering College—with a degree in mechanical engineering and in 1969 joined IIM Ahmedabad, what sort of a student were you?A: I was student in the top 25% or so. I wasn’t in the bottom of the class but I was clearly not in the top of the class. What I have learnt in college is that it is not necessary to be at the top in the class. I think leadership comes from all across the class. That is the message that I learnt and that is the message that I would share with the youngsters. Being in the top 5, 10 is not really material to what you can do for your own good and for societal good later on.Q: So what drove you while you were at IIM Ahmedabad because that was the key turning point in your life, you could have gone back joined your family's styling business but you decided not to, so what was it that drove you to actually get professional training and not move towards the family business?A: I think I got fascinated by finance as a subject and when I graduated I looked for jobs in the financial services sector and ICICI just happened to be there and that is how I walked into this business.Q: You said in an earlier interview that, I am probably too technical a person, I wonder sometimes if I would have been a better person, a better leader and achieved more had I been exposed more to the liberal arts. Do you regret not having been exposed to liberal arts since we are debating on what needs to change in the manner in which business curriculum is currently being run, what do you think is the need of the hour at this point in time?A: Unfortunately that wisdom dawned on me very late. It probably took 20 years of believing that engineer is the be all and the end all, that you need to be an engineer to be anything. To debunk that idea took me a long time. I think that debunking took place over a period of time. It was shaped over a period of time. You saw reality because I would think as an engineer you lived in an unreal world, by unreal I am not talking about a world of Maya but a world where it was very narrow and everything was numbers, everything was data and everything was driven by analytics.You then don’t tend to use your other skills which you ought to use to try to come to decision making and I think if you were better rounded in terms of your skill sense, in terms of other areas of knowledge which you ought to have been exposed to, I think your decision making would have gotten that much better. And that is the context in which I said if I had to reinvent myself it will probably not be as an engineer, it would probably be somebody with a much wider experience enabling me to take better and more correct decisions."},
{"title": "An Inspiring Speech", "date": "Sunday, September 5, 2010", "text": "A must read and a must act for all. Former President of India, Dr.  A. P. J. Abdul Kalam opens his bleeding heart before the youth of India. ----I have three visions for India. In 3000 years of our history people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards. The Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my first vision is that of FREEDOM. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the war of independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us.My second vision for India is DEVELOPMENT. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among top 5 nations of the world in terms of GDP. We have 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognized today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn’t this incorrect?I have a THIRD vision. India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai of the Dept. of space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life.I see four milestones in my career: ONE: Twenty years I spent in ISRO. I was given the opportunity to be the project director for India’s first satellite launch vehicle, SLV3. The one that launched Rohini. These years played a very important role in my life of Scientist.TWO: After my ISRO years, I joined DRDO and got a chance to be the part of India’s missile program. It was my second bliss when Agni met its mission requirements in 1994.THREE: The Dept. of Atomic Energy and DRDO had this tremendous partnership in the recent nuclear tests, on May 11 and 13. This was the third bliss. The joy of participating with my team in these nuclear tests and proving to the world that India can make it, that we are no longer a developing nation but one of them. It made me feel very proud as an Indian. The fact that we have now developed for Agni a re-entry structure, for which we have developed this new material. A Very light material called carbon-carbon.FOUR: One day an orthopedic surgeon from Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences visited my laboratory. He lifted the material and found it so light that he took me to his hospital and showed me his patients. There were these little girls and boys with heavy metallic calipers weighing over three kg. each, dragging their feet around. He said to me: Please remove the pain of my patients. In three weeks, we made these Floor reaction Orthosis 300 gram calipers and took them to the orthopedic centre. The children didn’t believe their eyes. From dragging around a three kg. load on their legs, they could now move around! Their parents had tears in their eyes. That was my fourth bliss!Why is the media here so negative? Why are we in India so embarrassed to recognize our own strengths, our achievements? We are such a great nation. We have so many amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them. Why? We are the first in milk production. We are number one in Remote sensing satellites. We are the second largest producer of wheat. We are the second largest producer of rice. Look at Dr. Sudarshan, he has transferred the tribal village into a self-sustaining, self-driving unit. There are millions of such achievements but our media is only obsessed in the bad news and failures and disasters.I was in Tel Aviv once and I was reading the Israeli newspaper. It was the day after a lot of attacks and bombardments and deaths had taken place. The Hamas had struck. But the front page of the newspaper had the picture of a Jewish gentleman who in five years had transformed his desert land into an orchid and a granary. It was this inspiring picture that everyone woke up to. The gory details of killings, bombardments, deaths, were inside in the newspaper, buried among other news. In India we only read about death, sickness, terrorism, crime. Why are we so NEGATIVE? Another question: Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign things? We want foreign TVs, we want foreign shirts. We want foreign technology. Why this obsession with everything imported. Do we not realize that self-respect comes with self-reliance?I was in Hyderabad giving this lecture, when a 14 year old girl asked me for my autograph. I asked her what her goal in life is: She replied: I want to live in a developed India. For her, you and I will have to build this developed India. You must proclaim. India is not an under-developed nation; it is a highly developed nation.Allow me to come back with vengeance. Got 10 minutes for your country?YOU say that our government is inefficient. YOU say that our laws are too old. YOU say that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. YOU say that the phones don’t work, the railways are a joke, the airline is the worst in the world, mails never reach their destination. YOU say that our country has been fed to the dogs and is the absolute pits. YOU say, say and say.What do YOU do about it? Take a person on his way to Singapore. Give him a name – YOURS. Give him a face – YOURS. YOU walk out of the airport and you are at your International best. In Singapore you don’t throw cigarette butts on the roads or eat in the stores. YOU are as proud of their Underground Links as they are. You pay $5 (approx. Rs. 60) to drive through Orchard Road (equivalent of Mahim Causeway or Pedder Road) between 5 PM and 8 PM.YOU comeback to the parking lot to punch your parking ticket if you have over stayed in a restaurant or a shopping mall irrespective of your status identity. In Singapore you don’t say anything, DO YOU? YOU wouldn’t dare to eat in public during Ramadan, in Dubai. YOU would not dare to go out without your head covered in Jeddah. YOU would not dare to buy an employee of the telephone exchange in London at 10 pounds (Rs. 650) a month to, “see to it that my STD and ISD calls are billed to someone else.” YOU would not dare to speed beyond 55 mph (88 kph) in Washington and then tell the traffic cop, “Jaanta hai sala main kaun hoon (Do you know who I am?). I am so and so’s son. Take your two bucks and get lost.” YOU wouldn’t chuck an empty coconut shell anywhere other than the garbage pail on the beaches in Australia and New Zealand. Why don’t YOU spit Paan on the streets of Tokyo? Why don’t YOU use examination jockeys or buy fake certificates in Boston? We are still talking of the same YOU. YOU who can respect and conform to a foreign system in other countries but cannot in your own. You who will throw papers and cigarettes on the road the moment you touch Indian ground. If you can be an involved and appreciative citizen in an alien country why cannot you be the same here in India. Once in an interview, the famous Ex-municipal commissioner of Bombay Mr.Tinaikar had a point to make. “Rich people’s dogs are walked on the streets to leave their affluent droppings all over the place,” he said. “And then the same people turn around to criticize and blame the authorities for inefficiency and dirty pavements. What do they expect the officers to do? Go down with a broom every time their dog feels the pressure in his bowels? In America every dog owner has to clean up after his pet has done the job. Same in Japan. Will the Indian citizen do that here?” He’s right. We go to the polls to choose a government and after that forfeit all responsibility. We sit back wanting to be pampered and expect the government to do everything for us whilst our contribution is totally negative. We expect the government to clean up but we are not going to stop chucking garbage all over the place nor are we going to stop to pick a up a stray piece of paper and throw it in the bin. We expect the railways to provide clean bathrooms but we are not going to learn the proper use of bathrooms. We want Indian Airlines and Air India to provide the best of food and toiletries but we are not going to stop pilfering at the least opportunity. This applies even to the staff who is known not to pass on the service to the public. When it comes to burning social issues like those related to women, dowry, girl child and others, we make loud drawing room protestations and continue to do the reverse at home. Our excuse? “It’s the whole system which has to change, how will it matter if I alone forego my sons’ rights to a dowry.” So who’s going to change the system? What does a system consist of? Very conveniently for us it consists of our neighbors, other households, other cities, other communities and the government. But definitely not me and YOU. When it comes to us actually making a positive contribution to the system we lock ourselves along with our families into a safe cocoon and look into the distance at countries far away and wait for a Mr. Clean to come along & work miracles for us with a majestic sweep of his hand. Or we leave the country and run away. Like lazy cowards hounded by our fears we run to America to bask in their glory and praise their system. When New York becomes insecure we run to England. When England experiences unemployment, we take the next flight out to the Gulf. When the Gulf is war struck, we demand to be rescued and brought home by the Indian government. Everybody is out to abuse and rape the country. Nobody thinks of feeding the system. Our conscience is mortgaged to money.Dear Indians, The article is highly thought inductive, calls for a great deal of introspection and pricks one’s conscience too….I am echoing J.F. Kennedy’s words to his fellow Americans to relate to Indians…..“ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY”Lets do what India needs from us.- Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam"},

The other got connected on his cell phone. After a few iterations we settled at a 5 p.m. meeting. The meeting was to discuss two points that might come up in a high level meeting we are expecting soon. It was found that the students needed some time to organize their thoughts. We decided that they would send 3-4 lines on each point by mail and I'd give my feedback then.A meeting that was supposed to be short became a feast of philosophy and its practical aspect, the central theme being \"Freedom\". I assured Prof. SH, Program Officer, NSS that I'd upload NSS survey form in Intinno by 6 p.m. once this meeting was over, and that I could do that only at 8 p.m.! Though the student posing most of the questions were constantly asking me if I was getting late. When you discuss freedom you are in touch with eternity :-) The hunger in mind was not in conflict with hunger in stomach either. Mr. Abhay Ghosh, looking after Electronic Circuit Lab. in our Dept. was distributing snacks packets to celebrate the institute award he received on institute foundation day for his contribution to athletics in inter-IIT meet. I told him that we would share one packet but he was not satisfied without giving one to each of us in the room. Thank you, Abhayada for the treat. We wish that you scale newer heights and get more such recognitions and we have more opportunities to celebrate.The discussion started on the traditional line - a fiery youth finding fault with Government, Administration for all the malaise. Why there is no road, electricity, irrigation, quality health service and education in all parts of the country? We tried to understand what is this Government or Administration. If one reads policy documents, looks at various welfare schemes, money allocated for underprivileged sector even in a constrained resource country like India - the amount is huge and the direction well defined i.e. upliftment of masses. Why then it is not visible? We are failing in implementation. Use of information technology, use of management skill can take us up to a particular level. But man as an actor at various conversion nodes or interfaces are key. Unless we have compassionate, hard working individuals working in cohesion, no amount of policy statements, welfare initiatives are going to help. A former prime minister of India was saddened to see that out of every one rupee spent on welfare schemes only 12 paise reach the beneficiary. Where does the rest 88 paise go? We blame the system. It is you and me who are at different positions of this system in different avataras, different form. It is my father or your father or my friend's father or uncle or relative of someone amongst us who are there or who will be there. And why we need to go up to that extent? If someone asks what is the output of an NSS unit that has 800 volunteers like IIT Kharagpur or if we are doing enough, we shall come up with long list of excuses, exactly the same way people at the other side of the table do. As has been said, \"No Nation is great or good, because     Parliament enacts this or that, but because its men are great and good...Suppose the government gives you all you need,     where are the men who will be able to keep up the things demanded? So make     men first....Men, men, these are wanted, everything     else will be ready, but strong, vigorous, believing young men, sincere to     the backbone, are wanted.\"Therefore let us not indulge in blame game. Let us first try to fulfill my quota of service to the nation. Else, A blames B, B blames C, C blames D, ...., Y blames Z, Z blames A completing a full cycle. It might be a shocking surprise to A, a young student of IIT who was considering welfare of Z lying at the bottom of the pyramid, may be a small boy from a slum working in a tea shop or a fast food shop near IIT campus, to digest this. The boy Z does not know/understand B, C, D, ... Education service, Health service, Judiciary etc. What he everyday finds is that A is visiting the shop he serves in a jazzy cycle, costly sneaker, backpack, earphone feeding music from ipod and of course well-dressed and spending money almost at will (given the boy's standard of living). And the boy who works 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. earning Rs. 500 a month with a crippled mother and a little sister to feed might wonder if an IIT student could do more than blaming Govt., Admin. May be his sister was crying in hunger when he left home early morning for the shop. That it is not fiction or figment of imagination can be found from what an NSS volunteer reported sometime back (I discussed this in NSS orientation program).\"Today, I bought the study kit and presented it to the kid who works at a tea stall near .... He told me that he works from 7 in the morning till 11 at night and is paid a derisory salary of Rs 500 a month. He has a mother and a little sister to feed. His mother has a permanently crippled hand as a result of a fracture, and they could not provide her with good enough treatment. He has never been to school. He is 12. He has a lot of friends of his age who have indulged in activities like stealing, pick-pocketing, etc. And they jump over a wall to enter the campus for stealing....He was so ecstatic to see me. Since he has never been to a school before, he could count up to 30 and did not know the alphabet. I have kick-started the process by teaching him English alphabet. When I tried teaching him the Hindi alphabet, I came to know that I myself needed to revise that. Therefore, I believe I should better have study modules or some book to teach the Hindi alphabet. He seemed to be pretty much confused about addition; I began with simple additions involving things like a customer coming to his little tea stall and buying things. He quickly learnt that. He can't even read words in Hindi, leave aside English words. So, some very elementary things need to be taught to him, though its a different matter that the kind of life he lives teaches things the hard way.\"Can we not provide this little ecstasy to the underprivileged in our neighbourhood and prepare ourselves for owning up greater responsibilities in future? I later sent them a few quotes of Holy Mather Sarada which can be found here http://saradadevi.info/THM_book/p-97.htmlWe discussed what is leading by examples. Can any evil thought come to my mind if Buddha or Christ or a Vivekananda stand before us? Their whole personality elevates the spirit of all around them. The nobleness in their character induces good thoughts and good deeds amongst many even now, and they have left their mortal frames hundreds of years ago. If we read their biography what a revolution they brought in their era and shows how much impact an individual can have on the society. Why then cannot we try to become an individual like this? Why don't we think that if a person is erring, me too is responsible in some way as I don't have enough strength of character or personality development to make him think otherwise. The role of education was discussed which is distancing itself from moral values. Can we say \"We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is  increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on  one’s own feet.\"Then the question of priority came. And we entered into territory of freedom and was again surprised to see we are anything but playing into hands of others not being aware of that. Be it peer pressure or societal pressure or fear, I am not what I want to be, rather I am something which maintains some sort of equilibrium with people around me. We are not free even being the most gifted with the best of the intellect, security, connection ....why? Are we scared to be different? Will it raise a roar of laughter if I am off-beat? The society has an internal dynamics to maintain its state, its beats, a self-feeding loop, that asserts and reasserts itself saying \"Ell is well\" (not in Three Idiots sense though). This tries to justify one's deeds and securitize one's own and near & dear one's future. It happens in many a case imperceptibly, call it selfish gene or call it defence mechanism or Darwinism. Are we then slaves where the genetic code dictates me from within and the societal, peer pressure dictate me from outside? Are we happy with that? Can a slave ever be happy? Then do we actually pretend to be happy or think I must be happy now since I have this, this and these things according to societal norms? We must analyze this. We must give time to ourselves. We must be more than particles in Brownian motion, always bombarded with others' thoughts and processes and forced to act on that and have no time to sit quietly and meditate and understand the life's intricacies. A few weeks back I was attending a high level conference on Homeland Security where security experts from many countries came. In the plenary talk a renowned expert talked about significance of 'low faith signals' that remain hidden, buried under high intensity dominant signals. Whether you call it nature or God, whether it is our national security, caste tension, regional conflicts or our own physical health - there are advance warning but most often in the form of these 'low faith signals' and we fail to take note on this because we are swayed by high intensity other signals. The same is true for our life. We fail to recognize subtleties of life and get swayed by high intensity peer pressure.If we meditate on ourselves, we might find correlation with what scripture says, \"Bhuma iba sukham, Na alpe sukham asti.\" - Happiness lies in becoming big and not being small. And we have this innate urge to be happy that tells us to grow and grow and become bigger and bigger. What is the limit? When we become so big that we own the whole world, universe. In that situation, I am one with the world, everyone is mine, I embrace everyone. What is happening on the ground is that there is this desire to become Bhuma (big) which should be like that only. We must grow big, we must excel in academics, research, we must become CEOs, we must reach the highest. Well, everybody aspires that, then where is the difference? The difference is in enlarging our compartment as well as keeping the doors open. Whenever we close the doors we don't allow others in it and there is contraction and we become small mentally and we cannot be happy but only pretend to be happy. Let us understand that we need to grow big, raise our capacity so that we can serve more and more people. The more we do that the more is our happiness. There is no greater happiness than in giving.One has to give time to oneself first to break one's own inertia. I must be in a position to set my own priorities. Else how am I free? It needs striving. As has been said, \"Greatness lies not in where we stand but the direction we are moving.\" Can I set my own direction? As I said in a reply to my previous post, IITians are known for their problem solving skills. Can we get a bigger  problem than addressing development parameters that are not inclusive and sustainable? Can there be a better solution than one which wipes  tears and brings back smiles on millions of distressed countrymen? Can we set this as priority? Am I free to do that? If not, shall we begin another striving, another struggle for freedom?I would like to end with an excerpt from Vivekananda's letter. Vivekananda is our National youth icon, his birthday is observed as National Youth Day. Let' s see how prepared we are to grow beyond our self-imposed limitations and open/free ourselves up to ideas like these. Vivekananda writes,One idea that I see clear as daylight is that misery is caused by ignorance and nothing else. Who will give the world light? Sacrifice in the past has been the Law, it will be, alas, for ages to come. The earth's bravest and best will have to sacrifice themselves for the good of many, for the welfare of all. Buddhas by the hundred are necessary with eternal love and pity. Religions of the world have become lifeless mockeries. What the world wants is character. The world is in need of those whose life is one burning love, selfless. That love will make every word tell like thunderbolt. It is no superstition with you, I am sure, you have the making in you of a world-mover, and others will also come. Bold words and bolder deeds are what we want. Awake, awake, great ones! The world is burning with misery. Can you sleep? Let us call and call till the sleeping gods awake, till the god within answers to the call. What more is in life? What greater work? (Completed. Correction if any awaited. Watch for the next post for a follow up!)"},
{"title": "NSS at IITKGP", "date": "Monday, August 16, 2010", "text": "Got a phone call at later part of the summer vacation asking me to take up the role of NSS (National Service Scheme) Program Coordinator at IIT Kharagpur. Probably I could give little extra time, specially in NSS Annual Camp as NSS Program Officer in previous years. It is always challenging when you have a parallel responsibility of examining hundreds of answer-scripts and publish the result within strict deadline. May be I have little longer experience in community service related to work from my pre-teen days thanks to http://abvym.org  Still, my reaction was \"I am fine as Program Officer. Let the existing set up continue. I shall be available for whatever service asked for.\" Earlier too when this was floated, I pleaded the same way. But this time I could feel that it is unavoidable. Remembered the story of Panchatantra. Could pursue that I would look after all the NSS activities except the finance and I am happy to say I am being ably supported there.Since last NSS Annual Camp (Nov-Dec 2009) I had several consultations with a group of NSS volunteers to understand their perspective. The number of such meetings were more than 10 and majority of them lasted more than 2 hours. I am thankful to these students for their time and for educating me.We understood that a good beginning can make a lot of difference. First of all, there is an issue with motivation. The students largely do not understand how NSS is going to benefit him/her, the society that sustains us and his/her relationship with the society; how important it is to have an inclusive and sustainable growth for everybody's survival; how this helps in learning team work, leadership, problem solving skills etc. which enriches one's personal space too. Therefore, this year we started with well rehearsed NSS orientation program in institute auditorium.The next problem faced was that of number. Only the larger auditoriums which usually is used for larger functions (and not these activities) can accommodate 800 NSS volunteers at a time. Also this work is not lecture, class test, sem. exam. based. Each program officer taking care of 100 students find mentoring, evaluating job really difficult. Therefore, we looked for restructuring. Each of this 100 students units were divided into 10-20 member groups. Each group has a Group Leader and one Deputy Group Leader coming from 2nd year students and one Deputy Group Leader from 1st year students. We have empowered leaders in several ways. Besides that, every month end we are going to have a combined meeting of all group leaders, deputy leaders, program officers to take stock of the situation and for inter unit/group exchanges of idea, support and service.A big problem faced was that of communication with students - 800 of them interspersed in all the hostels and NSS office at Rural Development Centre (RDC) is the farthest establishment from hostels. For every single occasion one had to put notices on all hall notice boards which often got overlooked or crowded out. The students had difficulty to go up to RDC to see 'What's New', more so because there was no academic activity in the neighbourhood. To solve that we are using Intinno, a learning management system developed by our own ex-students. Till date 650 out of 800 students have enrolled there and all announcements/notices are instantly delivered in a student's mailbox. Also, a student query is addressed in less than 24 hours. For emergency, they are asked to call in my cellphone.The other problem faced was randomness in assignment of activity. This time during enrolment we gave a choice of 10 NSS activities to each student. The program officers among themselves chose mentoring some of these activities according their area of expertize and interest. Based on these two, group formation had been done and we hope the volunteers will be able to contribute more by this.Next we found that in some of the activities the students attend just to become a part of the crowd and get attendance recorded. There is no involvement of any kind and more importantly they do not feel proud of their presence in that assembly. This year NSS, IITKGP proactively participated in Independence Day function by following a dress code (it gave a beautiful disciplined look), publishing a newsletter (link given below, NSS IITKGP is going to have its own webpage soon) besides providing services like distribution of food packet etc. The audience appreciated this reinvention of NSS team and the volunteers felt proud of themselves.http://www.esnips.com/doc/41e06369-2356-48f4-afdf-5bf562b32fc8/NSS-Newsletter-Independence-DayThe link appears in Google buzz of mine as well as many NSS student volunteers. I am tempted to talk in their language - NSS IIT KHARAGPUR ROCKS.Whether you call it statistical aberration or 'chalta hai' attitude that finds its way in young mind because of systematic failure, there are always a few students who take this 'zero credit' course casually. This time we took it very strongly and wrote to respective Head of the Department and Faculty Adviser to counsel the students. We ourselves also remain available for any kind of assistance. Hope, this will not leave any weak link anywhere in the activities undertaken.Last semester we invited S.D.O. Kharagpur to address NSS volunteers. Based on his suggestion and his call to act as 'facilitator' this time we are looking for better coordination of S.D.O., B.D.O. and Panchayat office and an activity group has been created for this. We are always in contact with the Deputy Magistrate who is our point of contact at S.D.O. office.I shall talk more about individual 10-12 NSS activities when we make some progress there.All these are being made possible for the tremendous support I am receiving from my program officers and the institute administration. It is their love for our young students, to see them excel academically as well as a to grow as a responsible citizen of the country, brought and bind the entire team together. I cite a recent example here. On 15th Aug., one NSS volunteer told me that he faced some problem when he visited a village school in the neighbourhood the previous day i.e. 14th Aug. On 16th Aug., four of us - myself, one program officer, NSS Head and EAA Coordinator went to that school and addressed the problem. Besides this program officers/ coordinators are visiting work sites, taking weekly appraisal and helping the students in all possible way. We amongst us, the officers, have created a mailgroup and remain constantly updated. Fortnightly we meet for 1.5-2 hours and take stock of the situation. And we are receiving full support from institute administration. Hope, together we shall be able to make NSS at IITKGP stronger and the experience meaningful.I am thankful to my book publisher, research collaborators and others from whom I requested a window of 2-3 weeks. I believe that I could utilize the break fruitfully and NSS at IITKGP is on a roll. Late last evening, I finished writing annual report of NSS to be submitted to NSS HQ. That completes a full circle and now the hierarchy takes over.(Thanks to Srichandana and the NSS IIT Kharagpur Newsletter team for the photos)"},

All that we need is to show our concern for the same. We have the capability of formulating a decent plan, mobilizing resources and executing them. We have smart young Indians taking corporate India to newer glories. This is what they can achieve when they show their empathy for the poor and underdeveloped. From today's economic times.TRIBAL TUNESHOW THE STEEL WAS TEMPEREDTata Steel Helps Families At Kalinganagar Achieve Millennium GoalsNageshwar Patnaik BHUBANESWAR    THERE is something to cheer for the families displaced by the Tata Steel project at Kalinganagar. These families have achieved zero-dropout rate at elementary school level, sustainable environment, poverty eradication, increase in literacy rate, gender equality and empowerment of women.    The achievers of these challenging Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are not highly educated or extraordinary urban people, but ordinary members of self-help groups (SHGs) residing in rehabilitation colonies at Kalinga Nagar in Orissa’s Jajpur district. Helped by Tata Steel, the self-help groups called Tata Steel Parivars (TSPs) have successfully ensured that all children living in the colony went to school. Tata Steel is setting up a 6-mtpa integrated steel plant at Kalinganagar Industrial Complex.    “The noteworthy achievement of TSPs at Kalinganagar is that those families have achieved the target of 100% elementary education with zero-school dropout rate,” said Sukanta Rout, an educationist, who played a crucial role in motivating the children, mostly tribals, to go to school.    As many as 159 tribal children have been enrolled in the residential schools in Jajpur. Similarly, 50 children have got the opportunity of studying in one of the premier schools of the state — Kalinga Institute of Social Science (KISS) — here. As many as 213 children are studying in schools as day scholars. Simultaneously, there has been a significant jump in literacy levels of the TSPs to 65% in 2010 from 45% in 2005.    Most significantly, there has been an incredible and drastic change in the will power of women in these relocated families. The empowered women community are now selfemployed and are going overboard for what they are doing. They have engaged themselves in poultry farming, gardening, stone carving, saura painting and in setting up small industries like phenyl and pickles.    “A few years earlier, we were quite poor, we did not even have the money to buy food, let alone send our children to school. Now with our own income, we are not only meeting our day-today expenses but also supporting our school and college-going children,” said Jamiti Mahanta, head of an SHG.    While child and maternal health parameters are not encouraging in the country, the SHGs here have achieved zero-infant mortality.    “All we did to reduce the infant mortality rate is that we emphasised on institutional births. Women in advanced stages were taken to hospitals where they delivered healthy babies,” said Sabita Jamuda.    Ms Jamuda, who is the leader of at least 100 SHGs operating in the area, added that due to 100% institutional delivery and regular medical checks-ups, the zero-infant mortality rate target was achieved.    The survey showed that in TSPs, out of the 92 child births last year, only two children were delivered with low weight (less than 2.5 kg). However, no death was reported from those families last year. Among the over 300 babies delivered over the past five years, only one death occurred due to congenital anomaly.    Further, as a measure to combat HIV/AIDS, the self-help groups have taken steps to create awareness taking them to Red Ribbon Express with a proper campaign. This apart, they have developed a green sphere around them through massive plantation, thereby getting closer to the environmental sustainability."},
{"title": "Twisted", "date": "Monday, July 5, 2010", "text": "...Talent. That was the title of the Indian Express report published on 3rd July where a racket was busted where IIT student caught impersonating. Today The Telegraph reports an engineering student being killed in recruitment rivalry between two private colleges of south. According to the report, the senior students in these colleges get a certain percentage of the capitation fee for every freshers they recruit and for which kidnapping, intimidation, gang war are not uncommon. Such students are part of the campus community and in minority. The majority of the students need to play an active role to avoid such derailment of the fellow students. Engineering students, in general do not like enforcement of strict disciplines, policing in hostels by authorities. Also this is the transition phase in their life where they learn to own up responsibilities before entering professional life. It will be good to see if they can manage their affair well. This needs self-discipline, accountability on their part on how they run their business and sending out SOS to admin. if they find that their best effort is failing to protect themselves and before such incidents happen. This may help avoid embarrassments like these which not only run individual career/life but also bring disrepute to fellow students, institute, nation - increases tension of guardian, family members and as a whole bring a lot of negativity about campus life which otherwise is the best part of one's life!------Indian Express :: 03 July 2010Twisted talent: IITian impersonated others in entrance exam for moneySantosh Singh, Sat Jul 03 2010,Patna: They entered India’s top engineering colleges and then went about helping others get in — for a price. Police in Patna say they have busted a racket in which enginnering graduates and B.Tech students, including one from IIT Delhi, impersonated aspirants from Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, UP and Delhi at entrance exams.A Patna Police team swooped on Kaushal Kumar, a B.Tech from an Orissa engineering college and the alleged kingpin of the racket, in Bhubaneswar today. Three others — IIT Delhi student Ankur Agrawal, Kalinga Engineering College student Abhinav Anand, and Gopalganj (Bihar) resident Ajay Anand — were arrested from a hotel in Patna on Thursday. Ajay secured the 6,814th rank at the AIEEE this year, allegedly after Ankur appeared for him.“Now that we have arrested the ringleader Kaushal, we will get to know the full spread of the network, and whether it involves other students from IITs,” Patna SP Manu Maharaj told The Indian Express.Maharaj said Kaushal ran a placement cell and facilitated engineering admissions, but later switched to getting engineering students to write entrance exams for others. Abhinav ’s job was to scout for talented students willing to impersonate for money.“Abhinav, who knew Ankur from their days together at coaching institutes in Kota, convinced him to appear for four engineering entrance exams in 2009 and 2010,” Maharaj said. Ankur, he added, cracked exams for three fake candidates: two in 2009, one in 2010.Gandhi Maidan police station in-charge Inspector Aman Kumar, who arrested Ankur and Abhinav, said Kaushal collected Rs 4 lakh from each “successful” candidate.“Ankur was likely to get Rs 1 lakh as his share from the deal struck with Ajay Anand. We seized Rs 60 lakh in cash and some photocopies of admission cards,” Inspector Kumar said. Ankur, he said, had come to Patna to collect his money.----Tech student killed in recruitment rivalryG.C. SHEKHARChennai, July 5: Rivalry among private institutes to poach each other’s prospective freshers, with college seniors and alumni allegedly paid to act as touts and even kidnappers, has led to a student being beaten to death in Chennai.Jharkhand boy Nirbhay Kumar Singh, a third-year BTech student and “recruiter” for MGR (Deemed) University, was attacked with clubs by a rival gang of students from Satyabhama (Deemed) University last night, police said. He died of his head injuries today.Officers said MGR and Satyabhama were among the institutes that paid their current and former students to recruit freshers, who would shell out hefty capitation fees for management quota seats. The rivalry among these groups of recruiters, they said, sometimes led to gang fights over the kidnapping of each other’s freshers.Nirbhay, 21, had arranged to admit Harshik Singh, a fellow student from Jharkhand, to his university but the rival gang had spirited him away and got him enrolled in Satyabhama, the police said. Nirbhay, son of a railway inspector in Ranchi, had come on a motorbike to the city’s Nilankarai area, looking for Harshik, when he was attacked.Since there are about 100 private engineering colleges within 70km of Chennai, many of which have been struggling to fill their seats, the competition for freshers is fierce.The recruitment racket, which mainly involves north Indian students, has become so lucrative that many former students, most of whom have not cleared their college arrears, are now full-time recruiters. They have fanned out to their hometowns and nearby villages scouting for prospective students for Chennai’s engineering colleges.“We get up to Rs 50,000 per student depending on the capitation fee he pays,” said an ex-student of Satyabhama who lives near his old institute.Senior students in their third or fourth year are exempted from tuition or hostel fees, instead of being paid money, if they bring in new students, police sources said.An officer at Nilankarai police station said that freshers “brought” for admission to a particular institute were often kidnapped by gangs from a different college and forcibly enrolled with the latter institute.“They have safe houses where such abducted students are kept till their admission process is over,” the officer said.About 10,000 students from Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal study in three private universities — SRM, Satyabhama and MGR. Another 3,000-odd students from these states are enrolled in 30 private engineering colleges located around Chennai, police sources said.In February, Vikas Singh, a fourth-year student of Satyabhama, was kidnapped by the rival gang of Sanjeev Singh and confined to a room in Puducherry. Vikas and Sanjeev, both from Bihar, had clashed over recruiting students from their home state.Later, while Vikas was being brought to Chennai, the car overturned on the highway. Vikas used the mobile of one of his injured captors to call his father, then joint commissioner in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. The father then called the Tamil Nadu police chief, which led to Vikas’s rescue and the racket coming to light.The managements of the private universities and colleges claim they have nothing to do with the racket.“Some of the students and their parents, many of them in top government positions in their respective states, spread the word around that any admission from their states can happen only through these student recruiters.And if the college charges a capitation fee of Rs 4 lakh, these students mark it up as Rs 4.5 lakh and walk away with the extra Rs 50,000,” a placement officer of a private college said."},
{"title": "Abyss", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2010", "text": "Too disturbing not to take note of it. It is a collective failure. In this land of Buddha, Nanak, Kabir, Shankaracharya, Ramanuj, Khana, Leelabati, Meera ... or in recent times Vivekananda, Raman Maharshi, Netaji Subhash, Gandhi, Azad, Tagore, Laxmibai, Matangini ....what are we heading to? There were never a shortage of ideals in this country. Do we make our kids familiar with great lives? Do we ourselves try to lead one? Let good sense prevail. Let this madness stop. Let we all wake up before it is too late. Historically, we as a nation were better placed compared to rest of the world both on economic and social front. It had been and still is country blessed with natural resources - minerals, planes fed with rivers, forests, sea, mountains, desert what not. As a society we thrived with greatest of thinkers emanating from this place. We practised freedom, we respected diversity. In any direction we travel for 100KM we find a new dimension in culture emerging. The other unifying force had been in the faith of the good's triumph over evil, the highest place given to those whose lives are full of sacrifice and service. This was a great blend that preserved one's individuality, freedom at the same time the society came first. What is now seen as some textbook theory of borrowed texts was in practice here. Post 1947 we getting our economic quotients right but the society is facing a greater disorder. Much of it can be attributed to what has been mentioned in the following article and also not learning from our very own history. As it is said, \"The greatest learning from history is that people have not learnt from it.\" While a national movement brought independence for us and we indeed are proud of it, it is time to launch another national movement to come out of this abyss, to let development every nook and corner of the country, to deluge the land with good thoughts and good deeds. Youth of India need to unite and lead from the front. All great changes of the world is brought by youth. This cannot be exception. Students in schools and colleges should take this up as a national mission project, use their social networking skills to flood the nation with positive thoughts and ideas, force negatives to take back seat. Let we elders be told how we can help, it will be a privilege for us to join hands with you. We could not but you surely will.From today's TOI.Young, Pampered & RecklessIt’s a heady concoction of sexual and material yearning. And it’s making city kids commit desperate acts, say expertsPrithvijit Mitra | TNN Kolkata: It’s now being termed as the “city kid syndrome”. A label used to identify youngsters from affluent families, who are brash, daring, impulsive and often ruthless. They don’t hesitate to take chances in seeking pleasure even if that means they have to tread a risky path or even cross the line and break the law. And one out of every five Kolkata teenagers, say city psychiatrists, is ready to flirt with danger and is a serious threat to peers who are perhaps not even aware of his/her inclinations.    Early sexual awakening aided by exposure to sexually-implicit material is one of the major reasons, say experts. The murder of the five-year-old girl by two teenagers last Tuesday is not an isolated case. There have been several such murders in recent years and scores of attempted murderous attacks by youngsters for reasons as trivial as an iPod or a CD. Sexual attacks on teenaged girls have been on the rise as well. More shockingly, even preteenagers are being targeted as Tuesday’s incident showed.    “Children no longer have to try to lay their hands on adult material. They are routinely being exposed to sexually stimulating stuff in the media and on the internet. As these children are used to being pampered and getting what they want, they start believing they can get away with anything — even molestation or murder,” said Siladitya Ray, consulting psychiatrist, B P Poddar Hospital.    He cited the instance of a 15-yearold boy who had caressed a girl in his neighbouring flat and wanted to murder her when she later resisted his advances. “He was not repentant for having touched her forcibly and couldn’t accept her refusal. ‘‘I can’t take no for an answer for I never have, the boy told me,” added Ray.    The fact that hurting or killing is not pardonable is escaping many teenagers, experts point out. They are keen to have their way and don’t seem to care about the methods, said Arindam Mandal, consultant psychiatrist, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. “It usually starts with stealing to acquire something. Then, they start bullying their parents and friends for more. The more the latter give in, the more aggressive they turn. The majority of these youngsters don’t regret doing this. Some don’t even hesitate to break the law and it is this group that is the most dangerous,” said Mandal.    Parents are to be blamed partially for these youngsters turning aggressive, said Ray. “They are taught to be competitive and look upon their peers as rivals from early childhood. Consequently, they indulge in a game of oneupmanship and can’t accept the fact that they don’t have what their friends possess. And for these misguided youngsters, the bone of contention could be a gadget or even a girl,” explained Ray.    The city youngsters’ idea of seeking pleasure is now a skewed one, some argued. It’s no longer fashionable to do the routine things. They derive a kick from treading the risky path — experimenting with drugs, alcohol, watching pornography, partying late and seeking the opposite sex’s attention. “Till five years ago, 18-year-olds would do these things occasionally. Now, you have 13-14 year-olds going out on dates or bunking school to arrange a party,” said Amarnath Mallik, psychiatrist.    The wired world has only made things easy for these errant youngsters and the task of disciplining them a virtually impossible one for their parents. “It’s no longer just the TV. Social networks, e-mail and chatrooms allow you to surf the virtual world any time. The longer a youngster stays hooked on them, the more will be the temptation to try the forbidden. You don’t even need to get out of your room to indulge in sleaze,” said Mandal."},
{"title": "Vacation 2010", "date": "Saturday, May 15, 2010", "text": "Passing through one of the busiest period. A major pending work : 40-50 page revision of Comm. Book for US edition. has to be finished in this vacation period itself. Already exceeded time limits. Feeling guilty. Perhaps will put up something like this as status message : “Thank you for not considering me till vacation ends i.e. July 3rd week!” In fact, this is what I conveyed to a multinational research lab.’s India (Bangalore) head when he visited our lab. and discussed possibility of a long term collaboration - invited me to their Bangalore centre for discussion. This organization is in top three in terms of numbers of US patent filed last year. Also it appeared they give a good deal to university researchers in terms of IP sharing etc. I humbly asked if we can start the exercise in Aug. since my hands are full now and I shall be available in email if you need any info. etc. I am grateful that they appreciated it and schedule is drawn accordingly.Few days back there was an important project meet with a big sponsor from abroad. A new young faculty colleague nicely presented a new proposal and defended it quite well. There was one component in the proposal – every three months for next three years he has to go abroad to participate in a series of high profile meetings. One senior faculty cautioned on this part. Given the kind of load in other projects and regular activities at IIT – it may be quite stressful to commit such a schedule in one project itself. By the time one has returned and disseminated the ideas, preparation has to begin for next visit and it has to be sustained for three years!  In return journey I gave my input to the young colleague sharing same concern on time management so that he can take an informed decision. This is vacation time here. It does not mean vacation from (i)own existing project review, report preparation, submission of utilization certificates (ii)participating/coordinating new institute research initiatives and following up (do not want to say \"No\" if it is inst. initiative i.e. for greater good, benefit reaching larger number of people in the organization)(iii)research meet with existing/prospective collaborators (iv)commenting on others’ new project proposals and evaluating progress of existing projects of others as review committee member (v)coordinator’s job in an existing national mission project and a new role in another mission project (vi)admission process to IIT (vii)coordinator/faculty role in short term course for faculty members of other engineering colleges arranged in vacation (viii)journal paper review of others and the ones being submitted from our research group, PhD thesis checking and sending report (ix)finding people of new projects approved and arranging training for them (x)guiding/monitoring progress of different sponsored projects and research outcomes …… all these besides usual admin. responsibilities. I also have overlapping interests in some of the neighborhood NGOs engaged in community service. And not to forget the book writing job with which I started this post. In fact, the one next in series, me as single author, is waiting for this to be completed. The initial work done. The sponsoring editor (from India) does not allow me to forget. I appreciate that. That is the way to get job done from us! A major respite in this vacation of course is no class room teaching, answer-script checking. Trying to make the most of it. I often quote a once-popular Tata Steel catchline – “We also make steel”. An analogous statement for us would be – We also have a family. And in so called vacation period like this their expectation level is different. Yes, planned a week of vacationing. Rest is all work. The highest priority of course is to meet the publication related commitment.  Boss at home often says cynically which is highly correlated (That’s what makes a boss perhaps!) with the comment of super boss that got lot of media attention.  “The amount of effort you put,  I wonder when can I expect a nobel prize from you!” She is quite right. To save time, to enable multi tasking, a good amount of work I conduct through virtual meeting – email, chat. This also helps me to responding to that thread when I am most prepared for it i.e. properly switched off from previous tasks and switched on to these. These extend work hours. And there is hardly any difference from home and office as far as my contribution to the family is concerned. Credit goes to everybody in family for being a great support. Thanks are also due to them too who consider my service is of any use. Unless there is anything compelling or I want a break of some sort I may not be available with a new post in this vacation. From UG students completing 1st year there was a request on how to make the most of IIT days. I discussed that in person. I also told that I would come up with a post when I gather more thoughts on it and take views of my colleagues. Let me see if that can be done soon! Bye for now. This post may also give a on clue what keeps an average IIT faculty occupied with! Or the the title could be changed to \"Vacation - IIT way\" :-)"},

I want to know how are facilities in and out of the IIT campus like, school for kids, hospitals, shopping mall, etc. Thanks in advance for your reply.    R.    April 27, 2010 2:53 PM -----------gs said...    @R : \"I have an offer from IIT Kharagpur. I want to know how are facilities in and out of the IIT campus like, school for kids, hospitals, shopping mall, etc.\"    First of all CONGRATS! The facility is as good as or better than what is expected in a satellite city with a big railway establishment, three units of Tata (Tata Bearings, Tata Metaliks, TELCON) and many other industries, two army units (Salua, Kalaikunda) and its fast improving. The greatest part is that the campus retains its natural beauty, pollution free atmosphere which is absent in Metros. The district headquarter Midnapore is 15 km away with a medical college and many other facilities. Kolkata City/Airport is now 2.5 hours drive (140-150 km) with refurbished NH6 improving connectivity. There is daily morning and evening volvo bus service from IIT campus gate to Kolkata that takes approx. 3 hours and great for a day long fun trip to Kolkata. Puri is just an overnight journey (8 hours) and great for a weekend trip. Other beaches that are nearer are - Digha, Shankarpir, Chandipur etc. Inside campus, Technology Club is vibrant with many different activities from cricket match (IITKGP faculty vs. J.U. faculty vs. Railway Officers Club - triangualr, quadrangular tournament and so on) to Saraswati Puja. The in house movie hall brings latest block-busters every week with three shows reserved for faculty and staff and rest for the students. There are plenty of direct trains towards Kolkata and to south(Chennai Bangalore, Hyderabad etc), west (Mumbai, Ahmedabad etc. north (Delhi and others - Rajdhani, Neelachal etc.)Inside campus, there are four schools (KV, DAV etc.). Restaurants are plenty, the recent addition \"Heritage\" has two 'faculty only' and 'family only' lounge. Big Bazaar is there for sometime and Reliance etc. are coming up. A new AIIMS like hospital in Kharagpur itself (in addition to other hospitals like state general, rail etc.) got clearance from Health Ministry and State Govt. What else? A new fly-over to debottleneck two railway crossing at IITKGP entrance is coming up fast (almost all the pillars are in place, overhead work to begin). Anything missing? You have not asked let me share. This IIT may have one of the best teacher-student relation. Besides academic interaction they work together in many socially relevant projects through National Service Scheme and various other NGOs. It is great fun to participate in that, too. Looking forward to have you amongst us and work together.GSApril 29, 2010 7:28 AM -----------    Dear GS,    Thank you very much for your detailed response. I too look forward to work with you in near future.    Could you please also tell something about the faculty quarters. I mean, how good they are and what type of quarter I can expect when I join as an AP. I have asked this to the concerned Asst. Registrar also but no reply till yet.    Thank you again. I think this detailed description is very useful for the prospective faculties and it should be put on the IITKgp webpage as well.    R.    April 29, 2010 7:29 PM -----------    @R: GS's comments are tricky. No offense there. While most of it is true, it is highly selective.    Campus is green- Definitely, but beware of all kind of snakes except during the monsoon period. To be fair, I have not heard any case of snake bite though.    AIIMS like hospital - with the pace at which things progress in Kgp, you can expect it in the next ten years.    BigBazaar, Reliance - Well that's not where you are going to stay, are you?    Public transport - practically none. You get share autos which stack up atleast 10 people. Own a vehicle or book a taxi any time you have to go out.    Job Opportunities for your spouse in town: -NIL-    KGP has probably the worst faculty quarters among IITs. Leaking roofs, theft-even light bulbs and clothes get stolen.. You have to wait at least another 10 years to get a decent accommondation. What's more, there is no option to rent outside - power cuts for 8hrs a day.    +ves: Good academic atmosphere, student-faculty relationship, research support, in a month or two you will forger other issues.    -MS    April 30, 2010 9:34 AM -----------@R : Thanks for finding info. useful.@MS : Thanks for acknowledging 'most of it is true', no 'snake bite cases' etc. To me it is all about attitude - whether to see a glass one-fourth empty or three-fourth full. Allow me to address all the points one by one and we follow the rule - no offence taken :-)Transport : Every 5-10 min. bus or shared auto goes towards the central area of the KGP town from IITKGP 1st gate. There is a 1-2 rush hour in the morning and again in the afternoon (office time, school time). Still it is better than public transport in rush hours at metros like Kolkata. There are four car agencies providing car on phone call which is much cheaper than metros. Stil cheaper option is to have cell no.s of autorickashaw drivers who park their vehicles at IITKGP campus 2nd gate and call them for service. There are rickshaws at street corners for shorter distances. On top of all these I wonder who in campus does not own a vehicle!Job opportunities for spouses : Obviously not as good as metros. A lot of them teach in nearby schools. A few inside IIT Kharagpur. A few work outside Kharagpur town. There are 3 newly established private engineering colleges within 1.5-2 hr. distance from the campus. There is railways. There are many industries surrounding Kharagpur ( 3 from TATA group) that can be explored based on qualification and skill. There are few start-ups in STEP, IIT Kharagpur. One can start something on his/her own if wished. There are many offices, establishments in district headquarter Midnapore town that is 15 km away. Also there are few NGOs (honorary) for anyone to get interested in and contribute.Accommodation : Since it is all about perception, let me present data collected this morning from Estate office. We have here three distinct type of quarters. One is multistoried flats. Next is duplex with reasonable space for garden. The other is bungalows with large garden space. On arrival, one is given a 2 Room transit flat, with new whitewash and maintenance work done (you can point out more if you come across and get it done) with LAN, internet, telephone connection, 24 hour water and power supply with electrical fittings and provision for A.C. connection in one room (if it is not there, you ask and will be done in 1-2 week(s)). In fact, all acco. have these common facilities. One may even be surprised to get an offer for a bungalow!!! The present trend here is to opt for flats while it was bungalows sometime back. To me it is more difficult to maintain a bungalow (I didn't opt) as less and less people have time and energy to take care of a large garden etc.  But there are takers too.The acco. provided is on seniority basis. A better maintained acco. (by previous owner) will go to somebody more senior. I have seen many a newcomer opting for bungalow  and doing small renovation work themselves as per their choice. IIT estate office may do the same immediately if it is not a volume job else it may take few months.Since 2009 beginning, a massive renovation exercise of campus bungalows have started with older quarters are refurbished with new roof work, modern floor (tiles), kitchen (stone), toilet etc. A large no. of quarters is already renovated in last one year. Work for the rest is going on. In addition to this, 63 new flats will be ready in June 2010, another 63 in Dec. 2010, another 18 in June 2011. These are larger flats with 4-5 rooms, 2-3 toilets called A or B Type. If seniors take them, relatively better flats where seniors are at present become available to juniors. in last few years, 68 such big A/B flats have been handed over. Relatively older but in a very good condition B Type flats are 81 in no.s. Besides these there are 54 no. 2BR flats are there which have many takers. There is no reason to force anybody stay outside and there is no single example.Does it take 10 years? : Let me give my example. I joined here in 2002 July. I was offered on arrival 2-3 bungalows and few 2 room flats to opt from. For one year I stayed in G-Floor of a 2 room flat, for two and half year in 1st floor of a 2 room flat and after total 3.5 years (Jan., 2006) moved to present 3 Bedroom, separate drawing and dining, one study, three toilet, 2 balcony G-Floor B-Type flat. Institute did a thorough maintenance before we moved in with completely new flooring etc. It took some time but we stayed in our previous flat till the repair work was over. We have a small garden too to take advantage of G-Floor. There are quite a few duplex (which was preferred by seniors sometime back at the level of Deans) which may not be available on arrival but some of my colleagues got it after 3-4 years.In short, institute understands the need and is trying its best to make stay of a faculty member enjoyable in a proactive way. Any member of the family can fill up an online complaint even from home (as stated all quarters are on LAN, internet) at any hour of the day, it is addressed in 0-2 days (even if you are out of station on some official duty). For large repair one has to have some patience as it takes time to mobilize the resources. Few units have damps. Avoid them. Institute is either repairing or demolishing them.With 550 faculty members and the pace with which new flats are coming up a new faculty will have less waiting period than our batch. Estate office people says that will be a large surplus after Dec. 2010 since the pace faculty addition is less.Theft : We have two 2-wheelers which stay outside whole day and night (too lazy to push them in our garage around the car). Similarly, clothes are always there in balcony (G-Floor, uncovered). Never had any issue. It is a walled campus and security is looked after by SIS which is known for its service. Still there can be stray cases but we need not generalize. In metros, it is much much worse. Not only petty theft, you hear much bigger crimes there.@MS : Your outlines of +ves truly appreciated.@R and @MS : I have spent 34 years at Kharagpur (my father was employed with railways) and may have little more info. of and little more love for the place.Regards to allGS-----------Hello all,This comment/question will probably ignite some kind of wrath towards me from IIT-KGP-ians or will start a healthy debate on the aspect of regionalism in our IIT's.Recently, there was a post in another blog (R2I as Professor) where a new AP (originally from south) expressed frustration regarding the use of Bengali during official and academic related meetings in IIT-KGP. Even after requesting the senior faculty to conduct the meeting in English, he, apparently, was asked to learn Bengali if he wishes to survie.Now, the credibility of the above person can be debated; but we all can give the benefit of doubt to him given ones tendency to use his/her respective mother tongue when he/she meets his/her native speaking fellows. I would like to hear more comments from people who might have experienced this first hand. I am not just concentrating on IIT-KGP, but in general, the tendency to conduct official business in a local language, when some of the members attending the meeting lack the knowledge of that particular language.Professor Madras, your comments on this issue will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.-KApril 30, 2010 4:24 PM---------@K - Allow me to add more of such complaints about IITKGP.- The tower is too tall. It obstructs my view when I look up and I fail to assimilate as much energy as I should have got in another place in my favourite mudra.- There is a solitary cell near old tower where freedom fighters were kept. I want freedom. I want fight. But IITKGP authority says that it is a museum and doesn't allow me to stay there.- I cannot speak Hindi. Tried English with a local shopkeeper. He understood only half. Even tried German (I am a Humboldt fellow. Just returned and now has great command over it. Before going I learnt keywords/sentences in German)! The poor fellow does not know even that!Enjoy!----------I am another person (other one was P) joining IIT Kanpur. Can anyone please provide some info about IIT-Kanpur faculty housing and other facilities?Ragarding KGP, well i did my btech from iit-kgp. Folks, kgp simply rocks!!! -SDMay 1, 2010 3:16 AM----------Anonymous said...    GS:    Thank you again for your such an informative reply. Your inputs will definitely have an impact where it matters.    R.    May 3, 2010 2:32 PM-----------Anonymous said...    @GS:    Your silence on the issue raised by @K- indicates that what he is saying is true.    May 4, 2010 2:28 PM---------- gs said...    @Anon at 2:28 p.m. : I thought Anon on 30.4.2010 at 5:43 p.m. made it sound sufficiently trivial!    It is too wild an allegation to respond. I never faced it, heard it and don't believe it to be true. The character of an institution is different from an individual. IIT as an institution has nothing to do with regionalism and there are enough checks and balances within the system. We deal with young students coming from different parts of the country. The faculty members are also from many different states. It is mini-India out here in the campus. We are proud of its cosmopolitan culture.    May 4, 2010 4:20 PM-------@gs,One of the reasons I posted the comment on the existence of regionalism is to verify the occurrence/authenticity of such claims from multiple sources that are placed within the institutes. I must say that I very relieved to hear that such instances, if and when they occur, are almost rare when compared to the overall structure of the institute.You see, prospective faculty like me have so many questions regarding everything related to the institute; ranging from teaching and research to general life in and around the campus. Even though life will be much easier if one only concentrates on the positive things, it is very easy to get distracted by one such negative post by someone who is already working at an institute.Finally, as I already mentioned in my post, all I was looking for is information from different inside people. Moreover, I was not specifying that it happens (or not) in IIT-KGP, but instead exploring such incidents in all educational institutes in India.Thanks for your comment.-KMay 4, 2010 5:34 PM------@GS:If you see the faculty structure in your Dept. at IITKgp, there are a total of 32 faculty members at present and only 4 of them are non-Bengali. Still you claim that it is mini-India. Going by this number, don't you think that the institute is biased towards the Bengali people at the level of hiring.May 4, 2010 5:57 PM------gs said...    Thanks K for finding info. useful. You are most welcome to raise any issue that bugs you. Yours truly will try to respond to the best of his capacity. Everywhere you'll find some people finding fault with almost anything! Don't read too much into that. IITs provide best of the opportunities - funded research, industry collaboration, international alliance, enthusiastic & quality students, prestige, decent salary-honorarium for many things-royalty from patents, book etc. Great to be born in an era when India as a nation is looking up, making itself count, finding a place for itself in the comity of nations! Great to be in a place like this playing an important catalytic role in the process!    @Anon at 5:57 p.m. - Your stat. is incorrect. So is the conclusion drawn. Kindly check with other Dept.s too. Getting a faculty at IIT had been difficult. We have >250 vacancies. A strong reason for a person to opt for a position here has been - to stay close to home, to remain connected to the root. I wonder if that is something for which (s)he can be blamed or Dept./Inst. can be faulted with! At least we got people to shoulder the responsibility because of that emotional attachment! There is no single case where application from a deserving candidate has been turned down. The fact is that we get more applications from people of this region - most from Bengal, then Orissa etc. The same is true for any organization in any region. I think the host here has discussed at length how faculty selection takes place at IIT and who are the selection committee members etc. Also this is an age of RTI with documents available for every application - scores etc. Finally, IITs are too big, self esteem of people here too high - to stoop to so low!    May 4, 2010 7:37 PM------Anonymous said...    Continuing on GS's comments, it is very natural for IITs to have more of faculty from that specific region. Take four well deserving candidates one from south, one from east, one from west and one from north. Now say they are all interviewed in IIT-M,kgp,D and B respectively. Now since they are good, say all of them get offers from all four IITs. what will be the natural inclination. Person from east will choose IIT-kgp, person from south will choose IIT-M, person from north maybe IIT-D and person from west IIT-B. this is the probable scenario. Now things like two body problems can creep in. since kgp is located in the middle of nowhere some people might choose delhi or bombay over kgp. but bottomline is the region bias of the candidates automatically makes the IITs look as if they are hiring only people from a certain zone. In reality it is the candidates who are deciding which ones to join.    May 4, 2010 7:54 PM------@gs,I understand your point of view and I can also see how things might have played out in terms of the faculty numbers in different IIT's.If I may, I would like to ask one more question, the answer to which I have not found in any of the forums despite my constant searching.How do you see the new IIT's playing the role of premier institutes of higher education in India. In terms of faculty, students, infrastructure, research, teaching, funding and X-factors (if any). I understand that the answer to this question can be very subjective, at least in some aspects and quite objective in some. But overall, can you please pour your thoughts on this matter.-KMay 4, 2010 7:58 PM----- gs said...    Thanks @anon at 7:54 p.m. for elucidating the point.    @K on \"How do you see the new IIT's playing the role of premier institutes of higher education in India....\"    I think you will get better input from a more qualified person who envisioned these new IITs. Prof. Barua IITG Director often visits this blog. He may give better picture.    My humble observations are : A new IIT has to go through same phases of a development cycle as found in any other IIT. I have visited IITKGP museum and saw how things shaped up brick by brick, the condition in which faculty members stayed in initial years. Remember, at that time there were other established engineering colleges. It was a great sacrifice for these people who gave their shoulder to start the wheel. In the first convocation (1956), Prime Minister Pt. Nehru recognizing this effort said \"\"Here in the place of that Hijli Detention Camp stands the fine monument of India, representing India's urges,India's future in the making. this picture seems to me symbolical of the changes that are coming to India.\"    The changes have come. India as nation now is stronger than ever. Today the development cycle time for a new IIT will be much less. Each of them is headed by great personalities with lots of acad. & admin. experience. MHRD is extending full support. It is a pride of the respective state & the state Govt. is doing its best. The faculty members joining there, I believe, share the same dream and building their institute with their toil, owning up a challenge greater than their counterpart in an established IIT. As a nation, we are indebted to each of these teams.    @K, on rest of your question \"In terms of faculty, students, infrastructure, research, teaching, funding and X-factors\"    Faculty : Top positions - Dir., Dept. Head are filled up by experienced people with proven acad & admin record. I know a few good PhD students from IITKGP joining there.    Students : That higher ranked IITJEE student will chose an established IIT is a part of the development cycle phase. Need not be surprised at that. But the students joining there are also good. I interacted with lot of IIT Bhubaneswar students when they were here in 1st year. I didn't find any difference.    Infrastructure : These days it does not take much time.    Research : Experienced people placed at top will extend full support.    Teaching : No different from another IIT.    Funding : Govt. funding is very much there. It is not that difficult to get. You have to write a good proposal and defend it. There is no dearth of funds. It may take some time to get industry fund. But the newer IITs with smarter decision making process (agility because of small size) must be trying innovative measures to develop partnership with industries.    X-factor : X-factor cannot be told, it has to be felt :-)    Boarders from newer IITs can share their experience. To me every challenge is interesting in some way or the other. It always leaves one enriched if faced fair and square.    May 4, 2010 11:08 PM----- Anonymous said...    @gs,    Thank you very much for your response. I have been grappling with the thoughts of whether to join an existing IIT or a new one, in case I get offers from both. Again, just in case.    I agree with you on several of those aspects. Especially, regarding students, given that JEE ranking can shift by hundreds just by a change in one score point, I would assume that students joining new IIT's are as good (may be not necessarily better) as the ones joining the old ones.    Also, regarding infrastructure, I guess given the pace with which the modernization of India (at least urban India) is taking place I expect the new IIT's with their own buildings in a few years time.    I personally spoke to the director of one of the IIT's and felt very inspired by what he had to say about the opportunities that one would get in terms of setting up labs and making a difference to the research and teaching community from a new perspective.    Thanks for your valuable comments.    -K    May 5, 2010 3:35 PM-----Anonymous said...    If all IITs have a large number of local people, then how come IISc does not? IISc has more than 30% of Bengali faculty and very less people from Karnataka or Kerala region.    May 5, 2010 9:31 PM----- Anonymous said...    This is simply because more number of Bengalis go to higher studies than the people from any other states. Bengalis, in general, are also more inclined towards teaching and research after pursuing higher studies.    May 5, 2010 9:46 PM-----Anonymous said...    We are talking about regionalism in recruitment. How come Bengalis then are not there in IIT-Madras but it in IISc? IIT-Madras has mostly people from South, IISc does not.

We need more of you in this country to propose a region based quota system - more so for the well run, well managed institutes like IIT, IISc, ISRO etc. which catches eyeballs.

Inform the new IIT that you may get offers from old IITs and that you will make a decision within 4 months. Therefore, ask them for a 4 month extension. Atleast in branches like chemical engineering, the selection committee members are the same in several IITs. So they will come to know anyway. Better to be forthright.

Next is .. how to reach, how to facilitate, how to become an enabler, how to make use of what we learn in the best technology institution of the country ... for the upliftment of masses. Now the news of the second girl first as it appeared in today's TOI.All she wanted to do was go to school. Maybe she thought education would let her escape from a life of poverty and ignorance. But there’s no way to find out anymore — Firoza Khatun drank pesticide and took her own life days before she was to be married off by her parents to a neighbour.     Firoza, the daughter of labourer Ekhtar Sk and Asalu Biwi, was a resident of Mojampur in Malda’s Kaliachak. Firoza was studying in Class V of Mojampur High Madarsa. But Ekhtar and Asalu had three daughters and a son and were finding it difficult to send her to school.     Six months back, before leaving for Delhi to work as a labourer, Ekhtar decided to get Firoza married once he returned. Like Firoza, her elder sister Sammi was married off at the age of 14 last year.     A month back, Asalu stopped Firoza from attending school. Firoza pleaded with her mother but she went to the madarsa and had her daughter’s name struck off the rolls. She then decided to engage Firoza in bidi-making, a staple job for most women in the area.     Meanwhile, the family started negotiating with a neighbourhood boy’s family for the marriage. Firoza kept saying she didn’t want to marry, but no one listened.     Ekhtar returned from Delhi a few days back and wasted no time in wrapping up the negotiations. On Friday morning, some members of the groom’s family came to Ekhtar’s house. After some discussions, a date was fixed for next month.     In the afternoon, once the groom’s relatives had left, Ekhtar and his wife heard someone groaning in one of the rooms. They both rushed in to find Firoza lying on the floor, frothing at the mouth, an empty bottle of pesticide lying by her. She was still partly conscious and kept saying, “I won’t marry. I want to go to school”. Can we hear the scream/whisper of the partly conscious dying teen - \"I won't marry. I want to go to school.\" While Ferozas are not allowed to go to school, some of us in IIT campus feel that once we cleared IIT-JEE, it's time to enjoy. End-sem. exam. started on THU. Yesterday (SAT), the full evening music was played in full volume in a hall next to our quarter ... so loud that we had to shut off all the windows. Imagine what is happening to residents of that hostel. Not everybody there subscribe to this mode of enjoyment during exam.. It shows that some of us are, powerful enough to rule, are making fun of education. And this is the irony of the situation. The underprivileged (contrary to the popular belief) here wants to study and the privileged once reaching a safety spot (i.e. ensuring IIT degree) are no more serious.  I am not trying to generalize but asking attention towards our orientation and approach. As one enters IIT, one cannot miss the sentence in main building \"Dedicated to the service of the nation.\" What does it mean? Is the building dedicated or its service? Now onto the valiant work of the first girl. It is reported in today's Telegraph.A 13-year-old village girl from Bengal who was taken from town to town in Gujarat by traffickers and raped by “customers” returned with police to each of the safe-houses, managing to remember every street and address in an unfamiliar state.Mithu Das’s monumental feat of memory has helped put 10 men and women members of the inter-state child trafficking-and-prostitution ring behind bars, police say.Mithu (name changed), now 16, had never stepped out of hometown Habra, North 24-Parganas, before the gang took her away three years ago. After she was rescued by the NGO Anhad a little over two months later, she remembered every unfamiliar place name: Mehsana, Baroda, Viratnagar, Ahmedabad, Kanpur.She remembered the addresses of the private homes, hotels and guesthouses where she was stripped, raped and battered day after day — and walked bravely back into those very buildings and rooms, accompanied by the police.“She has been absolutely brilliant. The investigation became so much easier because of Mithu,” said Prakshita Rathore, a Gujarat policewoman.“Although she had never been to Gujarat before, she not only took the police team to the places where she was locked up but also identified the gang members by name. There were lanes and bylanes and she didn’t take a step wrong. In the end she busted the network in Gujarat.”Bengal girls are some of the worst victims of trafficking. A study by Save the Children in collaboration with the Bengal government revealed that across 265 villages in the state, 3,429 children had left home to work in urban centres and 271 of them — one per village — never returned.Mithu said: “I don’t have a good memory, but I have to fight the case. I have to say what happened to me in detail; so I remember.”“The truth is,” she added, “I want to forget everything, start life anew and be happy. I want to study and work hard.”Mithu, however, has a personal battle to fight. She is HIV-positive — one outcome of her two-month ordeal.“I don’t think she understands the implications yet. But she is a strong girl,” said Shabnam Hashmi of Anhad.Salute to Mithu. Salute to Anhad. Yes, she is a strong girl. She was in Class V when abducted and brutalized. Her memory helped, even if she does not want to remember them. Not everyone is as gifted (even if courageous, cannot recount properly and culprits escape). Wish Feroza interacted with Mithu and I am sure she could have the strength and a way towards solution. Let Feroza rest in peace. Let Mithu get her share of happiness, freedom. Let we all think how we can contribute, how we can dedicate ourselves."},
{"title": "Accident", "date": "Thursday, April 22, 2010", "text": "It is said that death is the ultimate reality and a great equalizer. It seems that we at the other side of it are judgemental even on this count. Or shall I assume that we are ignorant of the hard facts? This is a page 10 news in TOI's today's edition. It quotes report of transport research wing of highway ministry of India.in 2008, the country witnessed 4.85 lakh road accidents, in which 1.2 lakh people lost their lives. And more than half of the road accident victims are in the age group of 25 and 65, the ‘key wage earning and child raising age group’. That amounts to one accident every minute and one death from road accident every 4.5 minutes. TOI gets this from the ministry officials.“The deaths are on rise despite the ministry spending more on road safety in the last six years. We are not analysing the actual reasons behind road accidents. Had technical people with road safety expertise been in charge of the affairs, the situation would not have slipped to this alarming level,” said a senior ministry official. This post is to draw attention of young India what our country needs. It could be awareness drive. It could be technology based solution. It may require India specific technology. Certain problems exists in countries like India and research lab.s of developed nation may not have a clue of it or how long shall we depend on them to solve our very own problems?"},
{"title": "Page9", "date": "Monday, April 19, 2010", "text": "While IPLgate hogs the limelight I wonder where the following will be published in tomorrow's newspaper. Can you guess? My guess is page 9 or so for those papers where it exists. If we really love our country or humanity, we need to take note of the following and do not leave as just another question answered in Rajya Sabha. Just now came across a Press Trust of India report (at TOI web edition) where Minister of State for woman and child welfare provides this information.\"There are about 2.8 million prostitutes in India out of which 36 per cent are children....The common factors for entry into prostitution have been economic distress, growing consumerism, illiteracy, lack of vocational skills, migration, ill-treatment by parents and desertion by spouse, according to a study on girls and women in prostitution conducted between 2002-2004 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development....The village panchayats have not been assigned any direct role in prevention of trafficking, but under a special scheme called 'Ujjwala', financial assistance is provided for formation of community vigilance groups for its prevention...as per the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of persons convicted under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act in the year 2007-08 is 2,884....nine integrated anti-human trafficking units have been established in the states of Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Goa and West Bengal under the joint project capacity building of law enforcement etc.\"While the report focuses it as a law and order problem, there are more that cannot evade the eye ... what we can do to remove the very cause of it. Can we take up few villages around IITKGP and convert it to model villages without these vices. Don't kids in our neighbourhood deserve this? Yesterday, I attended a nice function organized by 5 NSS volunteers where they are teaching 22 kids of a slum. This was the last day for this team for this session as end-sem starts this week followed by vacation. What I liked most is the love and affection between these kids and the IITKGP student-teachers. They showed me Math Table and other works and then there was prize distribution. It was great to see the support of the parents and local youth. While the kids were working a man drunk even in broad daylight appeared. A girl student who was doing sums lifted her head and lowered it immediately with a murmur in native language - \"My father, I am scared of him.\" NSS IITKGP is beginning to make inroads. But miles to go and it needs a united effort. With a student strength as large as ours, we have the numbers but do we have the will?"},
{"title": "Publication", "date": "Sunday, April 11, 2010", "text": "Interesting! Interesting!! Interesting!!! ... This is what I read this morning in ToI. Was expecting something like this. If it is so easy, it is not worth it. If it is not, it takes time to mature an idea in the form of output and publication. Was getting tired of China-India comparison on volume of research publication. It is not that such things are not in India. A majority of the conf. paper from lesser known institutions in India that I review belong to that category. These are run by private entrepreneur who is in education business. There is hardly any quality faculty, students or research infrastructure there. But the faculty has to show publications to their boss who is not from education fraternity, so that the institute is ranked higher.  The faculty of Govt. run institutions do not show these vices. However, they are accused of lower volumes of publications in comparison to China and US. The Govt. run institutions are of various categories. There are primarily research institutes with no UG students. The faculty member there take one or half-course in a whole year with a very small class size of Masters or PhD students. Their every project/assignment can be of longer term with the potential of becoming a good publication (the PG students have adequate background). These institutes cannot be compared with primarily UG institutes like NITs, IITs. Each evening I return from office at about 7:30-8:00 p.m. Thereafter, when I start checking Mid-Sem. answer scripts it takes approx. 15 minutes per script of 4x3=12 questions with comments etc. Note that to an IIT student one has to explain each evaluation, questions, parts and subparts - even after the explanation is made they keep nagging whether for a particular error on his part 2 marks deduction is justified or it should have been 1 mark. (The time we studied as IIT UG 20 years back has changed. Now students file court cases, guardians email Director, student take image of answer with his camera mobile and his father who too is an academician comments if evaluation is justified and then there is mandatory student feedback)Imagine, how many days are required to finish checking scripts of 90 students. And the number of sponsored project one does, the number of national mission project one is engaged, the no. of papers/thesis one reviews, the no. of committees one belongs to with meeting, discussion note etc. - all without any secretarial support that means draft to final - every note one has to be prepared by himself. And they also have a family! Still I would say, the majority of the faculty members gives approx. two hours to their research students every day. However, one has to note that the research students in IITs, in most of the cases, are not IIT BTech, not IIT MTech, not NIT (or next level inst.) B.Tech., not Pvt. Engg. college toppers as there is good job market for them or they prefer to go abroad for various reasons. So, we mostly get the leftovers of Pvt. Engg. colleges in our research lab. and they need time to stabilize and get their fundamentals right before they can pursue higher things. Now by the time they stabilize, a considerable time has gone and funding period is limited. Effectively they pursue a challenge that can be overcome in 2 years than what a IIT grad pursues in US univ. in 4 years. So, the quality of problem becomes different. This makes a big difference and the vicious cycle sets in - better performance bringing better students even if we discount US life-style or dollar dreams. This post is not to question flight of good Indian students to US, a good amount of debate is already on in different forums. This is again not to undermine the research contribution of students in our research lab.s. In fact, the amount of value addition they do to themselves at IITs is more than what our best students do in US research lab.s. Also, it is their sheer hard work and lifting of themselves that keep our research lab.s running and we faculty members are grateful to them. This post is to be realistic in terms of volume of publication. Yes, certain amount of pressure does good. But it should not be too much. I cannot ask my research students to publish in volumes to fulfill certain quota rather I ask them to be honest, to learn from failures, to work harder and enjoy research, the newness of things that emerge. I ask them to write good English, learn how to communicate. And they reciprocate! I take pride in the outputs generated by these students - had their communication ability been better, it would have been published in top rung journals instead of mid-level journal (of course with impact factor > 1) they usually attempt to. Let us not to do what has been reported next.-------Copy + paste gives Chinese research a bad nameGillian Wong LIUZHOU, CHINA WHEN professors in China need to author research papers to get promoted, many turn to people like Lu Keqian.Working on his laptop in a cramped spare bedroom, the former schoolteacher ghostwrites for professors, students, government offices — anyone willing to pay his fee, typically about 300 yuan ($45). “My opinion is that writing papers for someone else is not wrong,” he said. “There will always be a time when one needs help from others. Even our great leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping needed help writing.”Ghostwriting, plagiarising or faking results are so rampant in Chinese academia that some experts worry it could hinder China’s efforts to become a leader in science. The communist government views science as critical to China’s modernisation, and the latest calls for government spending on science and technology to grow by 8% to 163 billion yuan ($24 billion) this year.State-run media recently exulted over reports that China publishes more papers in international journals than any except the US. But not all the research stands up to scrutiny. In December, a British journal retracted 70 papers from a Chinese university, saying the work had been fabricated. “Academic fraud, misconduct and ethical violations are very common in China,” said professor Rao Yi, dean of the life sciences school at Peking University in the capital. Critics blame weak penalties and a system that bases faculty promotions and bonuses on the number, rather than quality, of papers published. Dan Ben-Canaan is familiar with plagiarism. A colleague approached him in 2008 for a paper he wrote about the kidnapping and murder of a Jewish musician in Harbin in 1933 during the Japanese occupation.“He had the audacity to present it as his own paper at a conference that I organised,” Ben-Canaan said. “Without any shame!”In a separate case, he gave material he had written to a researcher at the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He said he was shocked to receive a book by the academic that was mostly a copy and translation of the material Ben-Canaan had provided — without any attribution. The pressure to publish has created a ghostwriting boom. — AP"},

The parents, teachers, seniors used great care to lead an ideal life themselves and guide youngsters accordingly. The instant gratification mode in which everybody, seniors juniors alike are trying to operate these days are leaving a gaping hole in the society. While this report is about health, one must have noticed that juvenile crime is rising alarmingly that includes kidnapping, arson, looting, rape even by class VIII-IX students. The earlier we take note of that, the better for the society and including we as an individual. Let us act, now and here. Let us not think it will not happen to me or my family.

{"title": "Children's Camp 2010", "date": "Tuesday, February 23, 2010", "text": "Waiting for NSS student San... to arrive. He wants to discuss activity to be taken up after mid-sem. Yes, mid-sem is on. Else this is the time for double lecture. In the morning prepared a report of the various works done by NSS volunteers who worked under my supervision and mailed it to NSS Head.Last Sunday attended a one day long 'Children's Camp' arranged by young members of Kharagpur Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal (KVYM). This is an annual event for the organization and seldom I have missed it. In fact, in my school days I attended it as one of the camper and later when active as organizer. This visit was more to feel proud how younger members representing the new generation have taken up the responsibilities and running the camp with comfortable ease with utmost sincerity and seriousness.After flag hoisting, Sri Uttam Chatterjee (Uttamda) discussed 'Mental Concentration : Why and How'. How important is to have control  over mind for any individual, more so for the young students. This was followed by a short physical training. A sound mind resides in a sound body. A balanced development of 3 'H' - Hand, Head and Heart is necessary. During breakfast break I went with Uttamda to KGP bus stand. He had to return to Chittaranjan today itself where he works for preparation of Secondary Exam. in his school. Uttamda, a senior member of had always been a great worker, leader and inspiration.Next, Prosen..., a young member of KVYM, currently doing PhD at IIT Kharagpur discussed on 'Character qualities' and how to imbibe them in one's life through regular practice. That a person can develop his character and there is a scientific way for that was the highlight of the discussion. Next, Sri Dipak Pramanik (Dipakda) addressed the queries of the campers related to first two discussions. I said a few words during this.There was a session on \"Let us sing together\" where the designated person a great singer cum teacher Kanchan Sil, attcahed to KVYM were supposed to lead. He suddenly fell ill. So a young member Souradip Pradhan and Dipakda taught campers, \"Ta thaia ta thaia nache Bhola\", a favourite of Swami Vivekananda.Then there was lunch break. This is the best preparation I have had in Children's Camp. We thanked the head of the caterer as well as Shantanu, the secretary, KVYM for the arrangement. Post lunch another young member of KVYM Anirban who is currently studying in Kolkata beautifully conducted the session where the campers told short stories, recited poems or stotras. I don't think anybody could do it better than Anirban. Kudos to this young lad. The concluding talk was the address by Swami Sunisthananda, Principal, Midnapore Ramakrishna Mission School. This was an open session. Guradians, elderly people also gathered. Maharaj blended it so well that the audience of different age groups were captivated for one hour and fifteen minutes.  I am uploading his entire speech (in Bengali :( though) in theses links. It is .amr file best played in nokia multi media player that can be freely downloaded (e.g. http://www.brothersoft.com/nokia-multimedia-player-46238.html) It is difficult to summarize what Maharaj said as each segment he touched is expansive. In short, he talked about (i) Arundhuti-Nyaya i.e. to start from gross else the fine cannot be immediately perceived (ii) Dogmatism coming from semi-literate condition even among the so-called learned who are out to educate others as there is no 'realization' (iii) the importance of tolerance, patience, forbearance (iv) Social service develops oneself as good human being. The civilization is cyclic in nature with ups and downs. There is no permanent remedy. One should not carry any ego that he has the solution to everything. etc.Then the camp ended with flag down ceremony. Shantanu, the secretary praised three B.Sc., B.Com. students Bahadur, Somnath, Krishnadas for successfully conducting the camp. Ruhidas Banik, now posted in Bankura joined at about 4 p.m. after attending another meet 200 km. away that started yesterday. Ruhidas doing the mentoring role at KVYM. The leftover food was taken to Diptimoy Babu's residence, an elderly family devoted to Thakur-Ma-Swamiji with both the daughters married currently housing KVYM activities. KVYM members gathered there in the evening for post camp discussion and dinner.Finally, the person whose silence is eloquence, who stands like a rock and guiding the young members, working with them shoulder to shoulder, my salute to you, Prabodhda, Sri Prabodh Kumar Sasmal. None can forget the contribution of young camper's favourite Bantuda who even with a paralyzed right hand and suffering from many diseases from childhood never gave up and remained an inspiration for many. One pic of Bantu talking to a young camper is available here. Other pictures are available in http://picasaweb.google.com/gsaha.iitkgp/ChildrenSCamp2010#As I complete this post, I finished discussion with two NSS volunteers who came in between."},

{"title": "Reaction", "date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2010", "text": "I used whatever free time I got to look for the reaction towards these back-to-back tragedies. In one, I wrote to Major S---- of Indian Army who has a root in IITkgp. In other case, I wrote to a very senior respected professor who was teacher of my teachers. The rest I read in newspaper or from web presence - blog, google buzz and so on. I'll share few of them which would definitely instil hope and confidence in us and show a direction. I'll start with the reaction of Ankik's mother, Alpana Dhar that appeared in The Tlegraph and ToI. -----She could feel the grief of the families of EFR policemen killed in the Maoist attack, for she herself has lost two children in a terror attack.At times, Alpana Dhar’s eyes turn moist. At times, a daze of disbelief takes hold as she gazes at newspapers carrying reports on the terror attack in Pune and the massacre by the Maoists in West Midnapore.“I wish terrorism ended soon. It has become part of our daily life, snatching away bright young lives,” sobbed the mother of Ankik, 23, and Anindyee, 19, who died in Saturday’s blast at German Bakery in Pune.“Many innocent lives have been lost in such violence in the past and perhaps many more will be lost in the future. I would have felt worse had they contracted some lethal ailment and suffered for days,” said Alpana.“I had groomed them in a manner that they would become good human beings. After their death, I visited Anindyee’s college and Ankik’s office and everywhere I found people loved them,” Alpana recalled.“We mourn our children, but we mourn their unfinished dreams even more. While Ankik was a number wizard and a bright IIT-ian who made it to a coveted position in an investment bank, Anindyee was extremely creative and went on to study photography. They both had plans to create a better society for the new era that is gradually awakening,” Alpana said.After graduating from IITKharagpur, Ankik had once expressed his desire to take the GRE and go abroad. But Alpana wasn’t too keen on this as she had always tried to instil in her children the urge to stay back and serve the country. Ankik realised this and dropped his plan to leave the country. ------She is just not Ankik's mother, she is Mother India. Salute to thee. Let us be worthy son of her.------Teacher of teachers speaks :\"Pune blast and maoist violence belong to different categories. Maoist violence is due to negligence and exploitation of the tribal poor for centuries;this exploitation has been mounting over the last few decades in the name of development.Tribals have lost their means of livelihood and very little effort has been made to improve their lot.Miltary offensive against them is of no use.We need people who would go and work with them ,be one of them,and find out what is best for the tribal people and act accordingly with support from all good Indians.I am reminded of the book \"three cups of tea\" by Mortenson on his experience with tribals in Afganistan;when you drink a cup of tea ,you are merely known ,when you drink two cups with them,you are getting closer and when you drink three cups of tea you become one of them and they listen.Spreading education of the kind particularly useful for tribals is an important step. A decent standard of life must be ensured.. Mahasweta Devi has made significant contribution in making us aware of jangal mahal people. There must be a massive Indian effort to wean the poor away from the path of violence. State and central military counter-violence is NOT the answer..The Pune blast has possibly link with Pak engineered terrorism...\" Prof. continues saying how a community by certain design were deprived of education and how Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose instilled a pride of Indianness across communities in his INA. A big and patient effort is needeed. For cross-border terrorism no chicken-hearted response will do.------Major S----'s view Dear Sir,1. It is indeed tragic whenever innocent lives are lost andespecially when taken by our disillusioned brothers we refer to asterrorist/Maoists.2. Its important to understand the reasons which drive a particularhuman being towards such cowardly activities. And reasons are notcomplex but fairly simple ones.3. In villages reason is simple lack of good education, economicdisparities, poverty, loans, dowry for daughter marriage (more is thegroom qualified more is the demand). It is very simple to brain washvillage people as they are simple and already feel isolated from mainstream. I had the opportunity of being posted to Arunachal Pradesh aland of infinite scenic beauty, but it hurts to tell that even after64 yrs of independence there are no roads/shops/schools/basicfacilities, leave aside these there are villages where people donotwear clothes and still reside on mountain tops.4. Now in such scenario what matters is who is the first one to goand tap these human resources, definitely people and countries witheconomic interest with the aim of destabilizing a developing nationand corrupt its youth potential advantage have outscored our ableleaders and society.5. In cities lack of jobs and ever visible degrading society culture,police atrocities( jesica lal murder by a brat son of a politician,ruchika’s molestation by a police DGP, Army land scam, Madhu kodascam, Convicted for murder people like Shibhu soren reelected as CMetc…) all these incidents creates stress in the jobless youngcountrymen and installs sense of hatred, disillusionment and revengeagainst the haves thus making them soft targets for exploitation.6. The idea is to approach them before anti nationals do so. This canbe done very effectively by education, creating opportunities,transparency and willingness in administrators to implement policiesfairly and without corruption, which I find is slowly being achievedand implemented. Our society is evolving towards it, people havestarted questioning politics, Scams are being busted and people beingarrested. The very fact we are discussing these issues shows thewillingness of present society which feels responsible and has thepotential to bring change.7. What can be done at IIT level?(a) The students taking up NCC should imbibe the spirit ofDiscipline, Sacrifice, Service before Self, Team Spirit andbrotherhood rather than just taking up and completing the 2 yearssince it is compulsory. A lot of responsibility lies on NCC groupimparting this education to students in true sense. Definitely astudent who imbibes the true message will turn out to be a betterstudent and in long run a better national.(b) With NSS we should imbibe the message that we owe more to societythan we actually demand from it. NSS activities are mostly (not alland not everywhere) focused to complete the 7 day routine camp withoutthe students learning or the village where camp is held having anybenefit. It is not an NSS activity to clean a village, NSS focuses onteaching villagers how to remain clean. Students should be trained onactivities and those should be given as projects to implement innearby areas, where they interact with villagers and teach them howto do so and then should be accordingly jugged. Activities couldrange from how to keep village clean, how to managepoultry/fishery/piggery, medical camps, building roads, bridges etc.They basic idea is to win the hearts and minds of not haves byinteracting with them , participating with them and taking them alongrather than just spoon feed them so they are left lost once you leave.Better still if we can adopt a village and develop it step by step.8. Lastly sir, as SRK says it in his new movie MNIK there will alwaysbe two types of people in this world GOOD and Bad. We all can striveto be former irrespective of what and how many latters are.Regards------Google Buzz CAN WE DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE MAOIST ATTACK IN OUR STATE..BENGAL:.....every single man makes the difference...its no like that army is not the one and only solution...every man is part of th solution and some roleMaoist belief stems from years of deprivation, starvation and primeval living conditions of the tribals....and the guerilla warriors are mostly demented souls who have been coaxed into believing that the world is to be won by force and warfare..u cannot uproot this menace by guns and bullets...the world needs more love, more care...if we cared more for the man next to us..learnt to show mercy, to learn forgiveness...if we all changed on the inside...if we could all extend our hands to those who have been deprived..probably sumday things will change..this needs concerted effort NOT a Burst of public outcry and then silence .....U DONT NEED TO BE IN THE ARMY TO BRING CHANGE, YOU NEED TO BE THE CHANGE WHEREVER YOU ARE...Feb 17well said ..... bt the govt have already been unsuccessful playing with soft hands with them(i mean love and affection)..show them to leave in the mainstream of society bt they hardly care...should we not think something different(which i cant think) to stop this massarce....in our society?plz explain how do u plan to stop a person who's planning to blow u up by showing him affection or love. these terrorists(broad category which includes all kinds of ppl who believe in killing innocents) shud b dealt wid only force-n that's the only sure shot way. the govt knows everything there is to knw abt them, all that remains is to wipe off all those nutters, but sadly no body around has the balls to do thisof course killing in self defence is not a choice, it is a necessity...but i'm saying doing only that by strengthening defence is not sufficient...its important to bring a change in the way the world runs ...\"its a dog eat dog world\"....THAT SHUD STOP! when ppl in authority sit to discuss an issue, its always things like race, caste, politics and god knows wat that comes into picture and thats the end of civilised discussion! ppl living away from the seats of power HAVE NO TRUST in the government..they view them as an enemy..i'm saying we have to get proactive in development activities in those places! make them see that they are part of our world too! by love i meant this....lets try to bridge the divide btwn the haves and the havenots.....thats where EVERY act of violence has its core!problem actually doesnt lies in either hatred or it even cant be solved by path of love..............politically and practicallly speaking if we see the fighters who used to fight for either maosist or army organisation they are just doing their job in their respective areas.......and by some specific class of ppl they are continuously used.............unless and untill the exact relation at the top levels are not toatally exposed we cant find a solution.............i agree to the fact that love and all can make a difference.....but let me ask love can be a solution when the war in current scenario is only getting fuel of hatred........and i strongly beleive it's not like that..........politicians are using them now for their own benifits..........which are chosen by us..........so their is no point in making the discussion ideal......by 'INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF LOVE' ..............if it would have been an era of gandhi and nehru then i would have definately accepted it as a best way to deal with issue....because in those days these 'andolans' just came as a result of 'jamindari pratha' and all 'lokvirodhi kanoon'......and some group of ppl took the way of arms to deal with it............but now indirectly each and every common man sho goes to elect such leaders are responssible............change then ............or BECOME A CHANGE............then only u can improve12:38 pmbaap re..

But as soon as I came to know about the sad demise of Ankik Da, the anger, the frustration, the dissatisfaction, the grief reached an altogether different level……We dont raise a voice if the victim is unknown, and we stop raising voice in a month or two even if he is known.There was 1 terror attack in the US and the terrorists have forgotten the path to US. We have been facing worse attacks than the 9/11 year after year after year and yet all we do is hope it wont happen again. We are pessimists who expect the government to fight for us while the truth is we cannot stand for ourselves or our neighbour, or friend or for anyone except for ourselves. We are hypocrites talking about peace and harmony. We are not peace loving, but a scared bunch of people who mask their fears by preaching about love and peace. Busy with our own comfortable life, we dont look around, we don't notice that we are next in line.The question remains, why cant we bring about a change. Is it because the system is irreparable or because we are too lazy to make amends in it. I won't ask everyone to come forward, unite and take responsibilty to change the way things are around here coz this is the same country that has forgotten Gandhi's death, so these 9 deaths don't even stand in the line. But I am still writing all this since I believe, that some people think and act, coz i believe that even if one mind accepts this and wishes to change the way things are, the destiny will itself show the course. ….If the path is beautiful,first confirm where it leads, but if the destination is beautiful, dont bother how the path is..just keep walking...and this destination, my friends is much better than the timidness we have mistaken for reality.-------------- Scrap to Ankit’s Orkut SpaceWe all the nw genaration people should be arise and protest against this terroist.So all guys of ankik,anindyee & shilpa should plzzzzzz take those responsibility.Otherwise we will lost another brilient,talented student or a person like ANKIK,ANINDYEE & SHILPA...So everybody wake up ...the tme starts now...ur community says 'God is always there with me'..actually He wanted u to be with Him forever...may ur soul rest in peace wherever u r...its really high time that gov shld wake up nd do smthing effective...No word of condolence is enough in these situations. But we surely can show our anger and keep the flame burning in us in order to annihilate each and every m****rf***ing terrorist from our land....... We will never forget u ankik(and ur sis and friend) cause if we forget u we'll lose the vision of making India a safe and secure country as well......Sorry is too small a word........ but i guess d entire nation shud apologise to u n ur family for tolerating terror 4 soo long n paying 4 it wid innocent lives..... i dint kno u but it aches my heart n several others who blive in oneself ,peace n harmony...May God Almighty giv ur family d much needed strength n perseverence to cope wid dis irreplaceable loss...Of course you don't die.Nobody dies.Death doesn't exist.You only reach a new level of vision,a new realm of consciousness,a new unknown world.May ur soul rest in peace n god bless ur family n may strngthn deir mndz......------"},

Newschannel started beaming yesterday, 7 p.m. onwards. It is Headline news of today's newspaper. Twenty four Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans are killed less than 100km distance from our IITkgp campus. They were supposed to protect our fronts, border. Have been put there to fight our own people who have taken up armed struggle. How difficult it is for a person who have taken oath to protect his own countryman to fight against that very person. Also the elite, the haves hardly join military. Unlike many other countries military service for youth even for a few years is not must in India. The have-nots are out to protect the haves and bite the bullet. In most of the cases, they are the only bread earner of the family. What happens to the family when a father, a husband, a son is lost? Do we count all these lives? Do we shed tear for them? Do we think that we can and we should also do something? We blame political class, admin. people, intelligence people, policy failure...is easy to point fingers at others. Have we ever considered what others think about us, the strong IIT community? Imparting technical education is fine. The best students that our country can offer are coming out of IITs in thousands, year after year spending the prime 4-5 years of their lives in UG, DD, PhD program, little less - 2-3 years for MTech, MS pograms. How much they can contribute to the development of the nation (they are the most capable), united they are a great force, committed they can take development to every far and corner of the country. Have we teachers been able to impart that sense of responsibility? First and foremost, do we find ourselves responsible? We have mandatory two year (1st and 2nd year of UG curriculum) of NCC(National Cadet Corps) and NSS(National Service Scheme) program. Have we ever taken it seriously and committed ourselves? We need a 'Nation First' attitude at least for next 10-15 years. Let the IITs which host the best of the country own the responsibility and lead from the front. Freedom struggle is behind us where we fought against external forces residing in our country. This is a struggle within to see the fruits of the development/freedom reacheing everyone. When I say 'struggle within', I mean both, struggle within the country - struggle within ourselves.--------------------------------------------PRELUDEThanks Ixxxx for your mail and the note received from Axxxx. It is sad that such acts are on the rise. Just now I find in TV that Naxalites have killed more than 16 jawans in a camp at Shilda, not far from KGP. Check Star Ananda and other channels.I know not much about who are already brainwashed. What I know that who are not yet are to be flooded with positive thoughts, care, development ... so that they can counter negative influences. Can anyone kill people just like that? For some waging war against the country it is just a job. I am talking about foot-soldiers picked up from common people. We have to reach out to them.The following is what I tried to send to Prof. Nxxxx after today's condolence meet. That time I did not know about the imminent Naxal attack. The post I wrote this morning in my blog can be found in http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2010/02/tragedy.htmlIn grief with all of you-----------------------------------------------Dear Sir,You wondered why there is no outpour of anger. How much I welcome that! My only submission is that the fire is to be preserved and translated into action that goes into the making of a Nation. Most of the the times our responses are knee-jerk and ends in rhetoric. Sir, tell us from your vast experience what is needed. Sir, tell us what we can do as an individual as a member of very, very strong IIT community, how to fulfill our quota of service to the nation. The little travel I do, the little exposure I have with communities which is not elite (Rxxxx used the term), one can see a growing division, alienation and that make them a kind of soft target for people who are waging a war against the nation. Besides terror attack, we have many more disturbances within the country that is wiping off hundreds of lives every month for whom there is no support system, could be the only bread-earner of the family...we should condemn that and IIT community may ponder if they have any role to play.Today we are mourning death of Ankik, because he was one of us. When the news first came, I first checked if our relatives in Pune are OK. We felt a kind of relieved after that. Anguished again when one of the dead was known to me. http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2010/02/tragedy.html I asked one of my NSS 1st year UG student friend this morning. He tried to be kind towards me - \"Sir, it is human nature.\" The question is how we can become unselfish, what is our role as teacher-as student-as citizen of this country-as social being-as someone looking for a better career. And time is limited. How to fuse seemingly conflicting goals.Sir, it would be interesting to receive some suggestions from you. Also your experience might tell us that certain goals are illusory or transient and not worth attempting.Only to show that we are trying to do something seriously and sincerely and it is not all emotion, I am reproducing some of my posts to NSS googlegroup.Warm regards"},
{"title": "Tragedy", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2010", "text": "I was out of station for GATE exam. duty when the news of Pune blast broke. Our immediate reaction was to find if our relatives staying in Pune are alright. Yes, they are safe. A sense of relief descended. It is ironical as if the tragedy belongs to somebody else, family members of those nine who died in the blast. India is vast country. Everyday somewhere or the other there is disturbence and people die. Can we take notice of each one of them? After all, we also have a right to enjoy life! That goes the logic. We don't realize till our own house is set on fire! Somebody from our own family or community gets hurt. We feel frustrated, angered ... others remain indifferent as usual...ultimately, it becomes a personal tragedy and there is no collective, conscious, cohesive effort to address why this is happening, what is needed to solve this, what role I can play. Patriotism is now placed to history book which is not to be taken seriously as competitive exam. have different syllabi. Independence Day and Republic Day are now marked for shopping festivals. The handful that attend the ceremonial parade are more concened to get their attendance recorded in teacher's register and leave at the earliest opportunity. Community service, to work for the underprivileged, to bridge the gap between haves and have-nots are not well explained, neither one tried to understand that - Me as a parent, Me as a teacher are only concerned about how well my ward are making good career progress. It is least of my concern how well he is integrating with the society at large. In some cases I as a guardian would like to keep him centred around few things and limit his interest in other things ... saying, it is a selfish world, my child!If above is the analysis of my sense of relief after the phone call, we were surprised yesterday evening on reaching IITkgp campus after completing our outstaion job. It was a hectic schdule for all of us to conduct a national level entrance exam. at state capital, many of us had to skip formal lunch. A silent candle-lit procession of students stopped our vehicle. One of my collegue in the bus started wondering. Is it the anniversary of the student who died last year? The other said - No, it was not on Valentine's Day. The third said - Could it be a new expression for V-Day? But they would be anything but silent. As we descended from bus one Prof. of our Dept. told - Do you know ... it was in memory of Ankik Dhar, our E&ECE student graduated last year. Nobody can forget Ankik, that smiling face .. now in first page of many newspaper, flooding internet sites. That is the time we felt terror at our door step. Checked our E&ECE faculty mail. Members of faculty mourning the death, HOD calling a condolence meeting. In our residential complex, one faculty griefed, lashed out that so much need to be done. Went to Ankik's orkut profile. Checked his photo album. Read the Scholaravenue obituary, and other write ups of his friends. Remember Ankik. Taught him in the class, lab. Watched his BTDS performance. Debated with him on various issues. The entire IIT community feels grieved.The question remains unanswered - where do we go from here, why we remain oblivious till it hurts us personally?"},
{"title": "Non-invasive!", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2010", "text": "Here lies one of our difficulty in popularizing the 'Heart Sound Analyzer', a VERY low cost non-invasive primary diagnostic solution from Dept. of Electronics & ECE, IIT Kharagpur, a winner of DST Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Program 2009. That it is non-invasive and zero risk in nature, that invasive technology should not be abundantly used specially as primary diagnostic tool, that for cases where something suspicious is found in primary analysis a more detailed observation can be made from invasive ultrasound based technology etc... are finding roadblocks for popular misconceptions such as these. BBC News healthcare medical notes put ultrasound based echocardiography in 'Non-invasive' category. Here is the link.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/medical_notes/g-i/764038.stm I had to fight a lot with a senior person holding important portfolio in a VERY big multinational medical device manufacturer company at IKMC 2009   ( http://www.ikmc2009.com )  who was pushing their echocardiogram as non-invasive device and are trying to market a reduced feature version for mass-market saying it is absolutely safe. After contradicting him I gave him and the audience at Taj GVK, the reference of the British Medical Ultrasound Society (BMUS) safety guidelines http://www.bmus.org/policies-guides/pg-safety03.aspI am surprised to see the ignorance around non-invasiveness of a medical device where general population are held under a misconception and given a false sense of security by calling a invasive device non-invasive.  Simply speaking, from these devices high power ultrasound signal invades the body and gets reflected back which is analyzed. The high energy signal when absorbed by body cell can affect kinetics of chemical reaction, cause cavitaion etc. depending on amount of temperature rise and thus is potentially harmful. Higher power level and higher duration give better image/information (in the reflected wave) but that are more harmful to human body. It depends on the operator if he is following safety guidelines or more importantly educated about safety issues. Even then, under pressure (if he does not get a good reflected image and his efficiency questioned) he might overshoot the limits. However, this post is to address a more fundamental issue, whether an invasive device can be marketed as non-invasive. My little experience shows that here is where engineering professionals are fooling medical professionals. A physician does not see any incision, neither the ultrasound is visible (so is X-Ray, but it is much more harmful so nobody tries to market X-ray as non-invasive), what he finds a reflected image where inside body parts are moving and he feels that movement itself generating the image/video itself and the device is non-invasive. Let me end this post by quoting BMUS safety guidelines. Much harsher words about potential safety hazards are used by others but surprisingly are never highlighted.\"Despite its apparent excellent safety record, ultrasound imaging involves the deposition of energy in the body, and should only be used for medical diagnosis, with the equipment only being used by people who are fully trained in its safe and proper operation. It is the scan operator who is responsible for controlling the output of the ultrasound equipment. This requires a good knowledge of scanner settings, and an understanding of their effect on potential thermal and mechanical bio-effects.A fundamental approach to the safe use of diagnostic ultrasound is to use the lowest output power and the shortest scan time consistent with acquiring the required diagnostic information.\""},
{"title": "Awesome", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2010", "text": "Wow! A must read for all. Appeared in Current Science, Jan. 25, 2010. Reproduced in The Telegraph, India today, Feb. 01, 2010. Excerpts are put here. ---------How can science be popularised in a country like India?First, you must have good teachers. As a profession, teaching cannot be the last resort. Also, you have these elite higher education institutions that everybody wants to get into, and so the schools are teaching for that. People take entrance exams to get into a coaching school which prepares you for the next entrance exam. It’s ridiculous. Children have to work all day in school, then they come home, maybe have a quick snack, and they’re off until 9 pm or so in a coaching school. Where is the time to think about science? There should be much less homework, because excess homework kills the imagination. Amartya Sen goes a step further — he says there should be no homework at all, so that they’re free to think, read, pursue hobbies and so on. Sen also says coaching schools should be abolished, as they widen the difference between rich children and poor children. I never went to a coaching school, and I’m perfectly happy.Do you think entrance exams should be done away with?If you have a large country, there is bound to be a limited number of seats. There’s also much variation amongst different schools and states. In such a situation, there’s no alternative to entrance exams. But coaching classes must be discouraged... Maybe the exams could be redesigned so that the coaching centres are of no use.What do you think about interdisciplinary research?You can never force interdisciplinary research. What you can do is not have barriers against such research. Interdisciplinary research comes when two people who have complementary skills but a common interest come together. For example, a geneticist and a biophysicist may come together. It happens all the time in bioinformatics — people who understand metabolism, or microbiologists who understand microbes, are coming together with mathematicians so they can collaborate. You can’t force such collaboration but only foster it by ensuring there are no barriers.Do you see any difference in the ways research is done in developing countries and in developed countries?If you had asked this 20 years ago, I would’ve said there’s a big difference because the amount of resources people had were very different. In my father’s department (at MS University, Baroda), there was only one spectrophotometer and everybody had to use that. Then, it was a big deal to have a UV spectrophotometer. On the other hand, in the West, every lab had spectrophotometers. But all that has changed. When I first went to LMB (MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology at Cambridge, UK), I found it was not very different in terms of equipment. In fact, it was very crowded. There were freezers and centrifuges in the hallways, and so on. Of course, it had almost every equipment you would need, but everything was shared. I think the resource crunch is more of a psychological problem. Indian scientists have to say ‘I’m not going to do boring derivative problems where I’m doing a second or third example of something that’s already been done.’ But I see a lot of that going on in India. And I don’t think that’s going to lead to important breakthroughs.Can you we all put a little bit of our resources for paying back? It could be our extra time, money, energy depending on where we stand now. A little effort from all of us can do wonder if there is unity of thought and execution. Let news item like this get highlighted and inspire all of us to come forward for our country.---------NRI donates Rs 30L to Nadia schoolsAshis Poddar | TNN, Feb 01, 2010Shantipur: He has spent around 50 years working in Germany and France, but memories of his old village, schools and friends have kept drawing him back to Sutragarh in Shantipur. Now, Rabindranath Banga has donated Rs 30 lakh for the development of two schools in his native village in Nadia.     A three-storey building that has been constructed from his funds and will be used as a high school, was inaugurated on Friday. Another building, which was donated to the local primary school where Banga studied, was constructed in 2005.     Banga passed his matriculation examinations from Sutragarh MN High School in 1949 and passed BSc in 1953. He joined his school as a teacher and served for a year before clearing the SSC exams and joining the State Education Department, where he served for around five years.     In 1959, Banga left for Germany. “I went to Wetzlar and started working at a steel-smelting factory. When I saved some money, I applied to Berlin University and studied metallurgy there with a stipend. I got the diploma in 1969,” he said.     Banga earned his PhD from the same university in 1974 following which he joined Siemens as a quality control officer in one of its atomic reactor projects in Frankfurt. He enjoys a dual citizenship of both France and Germany and has stayed mostly in France."},
{"title": "Kudos", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2010", "text": "If the previous news item shamed, this is the one from another 'student' that keeps our heads high. Karekar passed Class X examination in 44th attempt. But what he says may not have been learnt by many of us, the so-called learned. \"I was never worried and never felt insulted despite failing the exam without fail. I only knew that I had to fight again and again till I succeeded.\" “Even my mother was fed up with my continuous failures but at least she would not ridicule me. On the contrary, she did all she could to encourage me,’’ he said, adding that other parents should follow his mother’s example.----Never-say-die peon clears SSC at 44th tryMateen Hafeez | TNN  Jan. 20, 2010Mumbai: A peon with the Mumbai railway commissionerate has a lesson or two for those citizens for whom one failure is enough to push them over the brink. Prakash Karekar, who is 50 years old and has completed 29 years of life as a peon, has passed his Class X examination in—believe it or not — his 44th attempt, and knows much more about failure, he says, than any other Mumbaikar.     “Look at me. The first time I appeared for the examination was in 1977 and I finally passed it in 2003,’’ Karekar told TOI on Tuesday. The eternal optimist, who now has his sights set on a promotion and a new life as a clerk, could serve as a role model for suicidal youngsters whose ranks are growing alarmingly. In the last three months, over a hundred students have committed suicide across Maharashtra, prompting much soul-searching among worried parents,academics, psychiatrists and even the state government. The Maharashtra police has already formed a 15-member team to probe the reasons for the spurt in suicides and suggest preventive measures.     Karekar, currently working for a monthly salary of Rs 14,000, said he had a simple formula that helped him pull through all the years of ignominy. “I was never worried and never felt insulted despite failing the exam without fail. I only knew that I had to fight again and again till I succeeded,’’ he said. “I got a job as a peon on the basis of my Class IX marksheet. But I wanted to become a clerk and knew that somehow I had to do my Class X and so did not give up.’’     The peon’s journey to an SSC certificate is illuminating. He failed in all six subjects in 1977. The first subject he passed was Marathi, after which he gradually conquered Hindi, science and English. Mathematics proved the toughest nut to crack. “But I never lost hope,’’ he said.Conversing with a German student of 20 years ... definitely in English ...curious to know German education system ... 'educated' Indian students...what is education? Shame! Our apology to Peterman. The other day Prime minister was talking about all-round development, national service (http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2010/01/all-round-development.html). Hope, we sincerely act in that direction and move fast.-----VISITOR SHOCKGerman student drugged, looted on trainTIMES NEWS NETWORKHowrah: A 20-year-old German student learnt of the perils of train travel in India the hard way on Tuesday. Miscreants, posing as Indian students, befriended him in a sleeper class compartment before drugging him and looting all his belongings. David Petermann, a physics student from Stuttgart, was on his way to Howrah from Varanasi by the 2334 Vibhuti Express when the incident occurred.   He is now admitted to Howrah General Hospital. He is out of danger.   Incidentally, the incident came to light on a day when the Railway Board convened a high-powered meeting to evolve new methods of ensuring better security of passengers in Delhi.   Police spoke to Petermann on Wednesday to find out the details. He told them that he had boarded a sleeper class compartment of the train from Varanasi on Tuesday evening. Soon after this, two co-passengers — who Petermann believes were around his age — started chatting with him.   “They said that they were students and wanted to know more about the education system in Germany,” said a senior police officer. “This got him interested and he dropped his guard. Later in the night, one of the miscreants pulled out a vacuum flask and offered tea to him. He suspected nothing as his two newfound friends also sipped the same drink. We believe that they also warned him against accepting food and drink from unknown people. This would have certainly cemented his belief in their good intentions.”   Petermann has no idea of what happened after that. On Wednesday afternoon, he was found unconscious in his berth at Howrah station by cleaning staff. GRP were alerted and he was shifted to the hospital, where he later regained consciousness. Among the things missing are his passport, expensive camera, cash, debit and credit cards and clothes."},

I cannot gurantee whether it really happened or conjured up from my dream. The quotes that appear below are reproduced from those faint memories. These may not exactly be the verbatim of the conversation but the sum and substance of it.It was a cold winter evening of January. We were back after a short visit to Tikka, a tradition we religiously followed whenever a journal paper is accepted from a lab. student. For the uninitiated, Tikka is not what you may have thought, it is a food joint.\"Let me play the role of a TV anchor and interview RS\", I started. Before this I told RS that he might have to make a speech. I believe that the modified mode of conversation was more likable. In the audience, besides 4 newcomers there were 4 seniors.\"Usually, people begin from the beginning. Let us begin from the end. What exactly went through your mind when you first saw the email stating your paper is accepted in the journal?\" I asked. This was a special issue in an international journal with guest editors , the stalwarts in our field.\"Early morning, I was in g-talk when a message flashed in the screen that a new mail has arrived.\" RS started slowly. \"It showed only first few words, \"Your paper has been...\" and didn't show the rest, if it was accepted or rejected.\"\"I got tensed, couldn't muster the courage to open the mail. Many different thoughts came to my mind. How much effort went into this work, how the next piece of work got interrupted in answering queries of reviewers, conducting new experiments etc. and what shall I do if I get a verdict 'Reject'. With renowned editors on charge, there will be many good submissions in this special issue and unless our paper cuts above the rest, it won't find a place. May be I shall send to another journal with some more work on it based on the comments made.\" No doubt that for a first timer who has just completed 2 years as PhD scholar and this being his first piece of work communicated to journal, apprehension would always be there.\"So, what did you do? You gradually gathered strength and opened the mail...\" I asked.\"No, I could not gather sufficient strength myself. I called my grand father over telephone. By talking to him I gained some confidence. While he (grand father)  was on telephone line I opened the mail and a sense of great relief descended on me .... yes, it is accepted .... my this piece of work is complete ... I can focus on the new threads which are at semi-finished stages.\"\"Then I rang you\", RS was addressing me. \"You must have observed that my voice was trembling in excitement.\" Yes, I did. Excitement like this is unparallel when one's good work is acknowledged by an international panel of experts.\"Now that you have completed a full cycle on your first piece of work, pls. share with the audience how the journey was constituted\" I asked. \"Compared to ERS, the first PhD from our Lab. in this area you could start from something, not zero.\"\"Yes, Sir (ERS) had to start from the scratch. He studied the subject by heart. Given a sentence, he can tell where does that appear, the paper title, author, page no. etc.\" RS continued, \"I found that one need to read a lot. The older papers of 70s and 80s were better written and help to develop the fundamental. If faced difficulties, I took help of books e.g. MS suggested me Papoulis and that helped me clear some doubts on mathemtaical issues. I found that the books are more authentic, reliable. I cannot say the same for all the joural papers even when eminent names are therein the author list. And conference papers are mostly unreliable. Some papers I have seen are demotivating and mis-leading in certain sense. They try to say that the roads are closed in a particular direction while it is not.\"\"Any suggestion for juniors, specially the new comers?\" I asked.\"Yes. Don't waste time. Looking back I find how much more I could do if I had used the available time more fruitfully.\" He sounded tough in advising, \"Now that you have taken research as a career, stop worrying about job market and concentrate on work. If job is what matters to you, then leave research ... it is not for you. You have to give more time, need much more dedication.\" Strong, terse statement but for the well being of the juniors. I am sure they will understand. Only a well-wishers cautions, shows weaknesses so that it can be overcome sooner than the later. I chipped in saying that one is entitled to worry about future but there is no such case where a student after getting a IITkgp MS or PhD degree remain unemployed. The more you focus on your work and get output, the more will be the employment opportunities. The meeting eneded at 8 p.m. when I received a phone call asking me if I feel like returning from tha lab. and if I have other responsibilites or not :-)“My biggest reward is the warmth and love these children shower on me. I get touched when some call me ‘Ma’. Now I see my Ayan in their faces.” ----------After losing son, she lives for orphans and urchinsSumati Yengkhom | TNN Jan. 20, 2010Kolkata: An accident snuffed the life out of Rita Ganguly’s 16-year-old son in 2006. But, instead of spending days in grief, Ganguly put her mind and soul into working for the betterment of street urchins and orphans.   Ganguly’s only son Ayan died in an accident on May 19, 2006. Ayan had left his aunt’s house in Baranagar and boarded a bus on route number 3 to his Shyambazar home when he met with the accident. Just two days earlier, Ayan’s ICSE results had been declared. The student of Frank Anthony Public School had scored star marks in many subjects. His aunt had called him over to shower him with gifts for his excellent performance.   Ayan had just reached Bhupen Bose Avenue and was about to alight when he saw an elderly man behind him trying to get off as well. Ayan made way for the old man and had just put a foot down when the bus started moving suddenly. He lost his balance and fell and the rear wheel crushed him to death.   “Though I hate to recall the incident, it keeps haunting me time and again. I wish no other mother goes through such unbearable trauma and pain,” said Ganguly.   Ganguly went into an emotional crisis after her son’s death, but unlike others, she bounced back soon enough. Staying in the same house where she spent 16 years raising Ayan, had become difficult. So, her husband, who works with a private firm, suggested that they relocate to another house in Ishapore. It is here that Ganguly came in touch with Don Bosco Ashalayam (DBA) — an organisation that cares for orphans and street urchins by giving them shelter, food, love and education.   The courage of these children of a lesser god inspired Ganguly to start life anew. In them, she saw a ray of hope and realised that here, she could get a chance to tend to hundreds of Ayans.   With encouragement from Fr George Chempakathinal, director of DBA, Ganguly started her journey with these have-nots — helping them with their lessons, working with them at the workshop during their vocational training, manning Asha Shop — a shop on Free School Street that showcases and sells handicraft and other products by inmates of DBA. She does not charge a single penny for her services.   “My biggest reward is the warmth and love these children shower on me. I get touched when some call me ‘Ma’. Now I see my Ayan in their faces,” said Ganguly.   “She understands us, our ordeal and hardship, though she can be strict at times. But that, I believe, is the quality of every concerned mother,” said Pintu, who stays at Don Bosco Ashalayam."},

The news item tells the rest.I have added a follow-up from 19th Jan. TOI report which brings another angle to the whole issue. It is seen as a part of a design to weaken India's position in climate change related talk.------World misled over glacier meltdown: Report      Press Trust Of IndiaLondon: A warning that most of the Himalayan glaciers will melt by 2035 owing to climate change is likely to be retracted after the United Nations body that issued it admitted to a series of scientific blunders.Two years ago, the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) headed by India's Rajendra Pachauri, issued a benchmark report that claimed to have incorporated the latest and most detailed research into the impact of global warming.A central claim was that world's glaciers were melting so fast that those in the Himalayas could vanish by 2035.     In the last few days the scientists behind the warning have admitted that it was based on a news story in the New Scientist, a popular science journal, published eight years before the IPCC's 2007 report, The Sunday Times reported on Sunday.It has also emerged that the New Scientist report was itself based on a short telephonic interview with Syed Hasnain, an Indian scientist then based at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, the report said. Hasnain has since admitted that the claim was a \"speculation\" and was not supported by any formal research, the report added.If confirmed it would be one of the most serious failures yet seen in climate research.The IPCC was set up to ensure that world leaders had the best possible scientific advice on climate change.      Rajendra Pachauri has previously dismissed criticism of the Himalayas claim as \"voodoo science\" and last week the IPCC refused to comment on the report. -----Glacier ‘melt’: Ramesh turns heat on PachauriNitin Sethi | TNN New Delhi: The furore over the validity of data used by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has taken some of the sheen off the Nobel Prizewinning institution’s reputation.   A day after it emerged that IPCC’s dire prediction that climate change would melt most Himalyan glaciers by 2035 was based on mere ‘speculation’, environment minister Jairam Ramesh slammed the processes of the celebrated body, saying: “Due diligence had not been followed by the Nobel peace prize-winning body.”   “The health of glaciers is a cause of grave concern but the IPCC’s alarmist position that they would melt by 2035 was not based on an iota of scientific evidence,” the environment minister said.   Ramesh recalled how IPCC chief R K Pachauri had dismissed a government agency’s doubts about the veracity of the UN body’s sensational projection about melting of glaciers. “We had issued a report by scientist V K Raina that the glaciers have not retreated abnormally. At the time, we were dismissed, saying it was based on voodoo science. But the new report has vindicated our position.”   The revelation that the data on glacial melt in the Himalayas was unverified has dented the image of the IPCC, which has set the agenda for climate talks. It has given a handle to climate sceptics who have long accused IPCC of being biased.----A follow up in 20th Jan. TOI. The scientific community must be careful and do their homework properly so that our own analysis can be presented in parallel to protect our interest else we have to accept what others say.World bending science to force India on climate?Nitin Sethi | TNN New Delhi: The United Nations IPCC’s admission of getting its facts on Himalayan glaciers completely wrong has again brought out concerns over the use of science, and pseudoscience, to pressure India to take stronger action on climate change or put greater responsibility for the climate crisis on it.     The 2035 demise date drawn by the IPCC in its fourth assessment report for Himalayan glaciers was used very often to demand that India should take greater action to reduce its emissions in order to protect people from glacial melts and floods. Similarly, a ‘premature’ release of information on the so-called Asian Brown Cloud was used by several western NGOs and governments to pin the climate change blame on burning firewood and cow dung in India.     While the UN released a preliminary report suggesting India’s poor were adding to climate change by using firewood and cow dung for heating, it later retraced its steps and admitted the results were partial and preliminary in nature and clear evidence linking the haze to changes in Indian monsoon and other consequences had not been established with certainty.     The release of the report, timed closely to crucial climate negotiations where industrialised countries were keen to get India to take global commitments for reducing its emissions, did not go unnoticed.     Discussions on the Asian Brown Cloud (ABC) — a thick layer of seasonal smog that forms over parts of India, like it does in several parts of the world — continue to surface periodically even today, and unnervingly timed closed to ongoing climate negotiations. One of the key authors of the ABC phenomenon was V Ramanathan of the US-based Scripps Institute of Oceanography, who will now be funded by the Indian government to carry out further studies on the issue at TERI, IPCC chairman R K Pachauri’s institute.     One of the earliest cases of scientific manipulation that caused a furore was when the US Environment Protection Agency tried to pass the blame of climate change to poorer countries like India. It had claimed that wet paddy fields in India were emitting very high levels of methane, an extremely high potential climate warming gas but with very short life in the atmosphere. It had suggested India had to check its survival emissions — emissions by the poor to sustain at even poor levels and not demand reduction of the ‘luxury emissions’ of rich countries such as the US.     It was later found, through research done independently in India, that emissions from wet paddy fields and animal husbandry in India were less than one-tenth of that the US EPA had claimed and that their impact was highly insignificant when compared to the large volumes of emissions by the industrialised countries."},

Researchers at the University of Sheffield have developed the combination that when given to the patient for over a period of six weeks was as effective as six months of treatment.    The team found that when a combination of doxorubicin — a chemotherapy drug commonly given to stop tumour growth — and zoledronic acid — a treatment given to protect bone in advanced breast cancer — regularly given to breast cancer patients destroyed tumours in a shorter period of time.    In a mice-model test, the team treated a group of mice with the combination every week for six months and another group for six weeks.

Great things can be done by great sacrifices only. No selfishness, no name, no fame, yours or mine, nor my Master's even! Work, work the idea, the plan, my boys, my brave, noble, good souls – to the wheel, to the wheel put your shoulders! Stop not to look back for name, or fame, or any such nonsense. Throw self overboard and work. Remember, \"The grass when made into a rope by being joined together can even chain a mad elephant.\" The Lord's blessings on you all! His power be in you all – as I believe it is already. \"Wake up, stop not until the goal is reached\", say the Vedas. Up, up, the long night is passing, the day is approaching, the wave has risen, nothing will be able to resist its tidal fury. The spirit, my boys, the spirit; the love, my children, the love; the faith, the belief; and fear not! The greatest sin is fear.                           Throw the idea broadcast. Do not be proud; do not insist upon anything dogmatic; do not go against anything – ours is to put chemicals together, the Lord knows how and when the crystal will form. Above all, be not inflated with my success or yours. Great works are to be done; what is this small success in comparison with what is to come? Believe, believe, the decree has gone forth, the fiat of the Lord has gone forth – India must rise, the masses and the poor are to be made happy. Rejoice that you are the chosen instruments in His hands. The flood of spirituality has risen. I see it is rolling over the land resistless, boundless, all-absorbing. Every man to the fore, every good will be added to its forces, every hand will smooth its way, and glory be unto the Lord!                           Train up a band of fiery young men. Put your fire in them and gradually increase the organisation, letting it widen and widen its circle. Do the best you can, do not wait to cross the river when the water has all run down.                           Work among those young men who can devote heart and soul to this one duty – the duty of raising the masses of India. Awake them, unite them, and inspire them with this spirit of renunciation; it depends wholly on the young people of India.Worship the Living God                           If you want any good to come, just throw your ceremonials overboard and worship the Living God, the Man-god – every being that wears a human form – god in His universal as well as individual aspect. The universal aspect of God means this world, and worshipping it means serving it – this indeed is work, not indulging in ceremonials. . . . Let some of you spread like fire, and preach this worship of the universal aspect of the Godhead – a thing that was never undertaken before in our country. No quarrelling with people, we must be friends with all. . . .                           Spread ideas – go from village to village, from door to door – then only there will be real work. Otherwise, lying complacently on the bed and ringing the bell now and then is a sort of disease, pure and simple. . . .My Ideal                           My name should not be made prominent; it is my ideas that I want to see realised. The disciples of all the prophets have always inextricably mixed up the ideas of the Master with the person, and at last killed the ideas for the person. The disciples of Shri Ramakrishna must guard against doing the same thing. Work for the idea, not the person.                           My ideal indeed can be put into a few words and that is: to preach unto mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.                           One idea that I see clear as daylight is that misery is caused by ignorance and nothing else. Who will give the world light? Sacrifice in the past has been the Law, it will be, alas, for ages to come. The earth's bravest and best will have to sacrifice themselves for the good of many, for the welfare of all. Buddhas by the hundred are necessary with eternal love and pity.                           Religions of the world have become lifeless mockeries. What the world wants is character. The world is in need of those whose life is one burning love, selfless. That love will make every word tell like thunderbolt.                           Bold words and bolder deeds are what we want. Awake, awake, great ones! The world is burning with misery. Can you sleep? Let us call and call till the sleeping gods awake, till the god within answers to the call. What more is in life? What greater work?                            Love makes no distinction between man and man, between an Aryan and a Mlechchha, between a Brahmana and a Pariah, nor even between a man and a woman. Love makes the whole universe as one's own home. True progress is slow but sure. Work among those young men who can devote heart and soul to this one duty – the duty of raising the masses of India. Awake them, unite them, and inspire them with this spirit of renunciation; it depends wholly on the young people of India.--------           Selected            Teachings of Swami Vivekananda                                                        My ideal, indeed, can be put into a few words, and that is: to preach unto        mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of        life.                                        Education        is the manifestation of the perfection already in man.                                                     We want that education by which character is formed,        strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one        can stand on one's own feet.                                                     So long as the        millions live in hunger and ignorance, I hold every man a traitor who,        having been educated at their expense, pays not the least heed to them.                                              Whatever        you think, that you will be.  If you think yourselves weak, weak you will        be; if you think yourselves strong, strong you will be.                                                     If you have        faith in all the three hundred and thirty millions of your mythological        gods, … and still have no faith in yourselves, there is no salvation for        you. Have faith in yourselves, and stand up on that faith and be strong;        that is what we need.                                               Strength,        strength it is that we want so much in this life, for what we call sin and        sorrow have all one cause, and that is our weakness. With weakness comes        ignorance, and with ignorance comes misery.                                               The        older I grow, the more everything seems to me to lie in manliness. This is        my new Gospel.                                               Purity,        patience, and perseverance are the three essentials to success, and above        all, love.                                               Religion        is realization; not talk, not doctrine, nor theories, however beautiful        they may be. It is being and becoming, not hearing or acknowledging; it is        the whole soul becoming changed into what it believes.                                               Religion        is the manifestation of the Divinity already in man.                                               Teach        yourselves, teach everyone his real nature, call uon the sleeping soul and        see how it awakes. Power will come, glory will come, goodness will come,        purity will come, and everything that is excellent will come when this        sleeping soul is roused to self-conscious activity.                                               They        alone live who live for others, the rest are more dead than alive.                                               This        is the gist of all worship – to be pure and to do good to others.                                                       It        is love and love alone that I preach, and I base my teaching on the great        Vedantic truth of the sameness and omnipresence of the Soul of the        Universe."},
{"title": "3Idiots", "date": "Monday, January 4, 2010", "text": "I'll come back with my comments little later. First, this is what others, the Professor community are saying.---------------From today's TOI---------------Break the idiotic mould: IITians Prithvijit Mitra | TNN Kolkata: Watching Aamir Khan come up with a simplistic definition of a machine and getting thrown out of class for not following the textbook description in 3 Idiots turned Sridhar Rajgopalan nostalgic. The former IITian could identify with Rancho — the character played by Aamir in the film — when he sought to argue with his teacher that even a trouser zip was a machine and an example like that could help explain things better than tongue-twisting bookish terminology.“There is a big lesson that engineering institutions across the country need to learn from the film. Teaching in technical colleges has turned mechanical and students memorize lessons rather than learn them,” said Rajgopalan, who has designed modules for schoolchildren that discourage rote learning. The engineering fraternity in Kolkata accepts that ‘aal izz not well’ with them and that it is time to break the mould.Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) vice-chancellor Ajoy Ray believes there is a lot of substance in the message that the film seeks to deliver. “We need to change our teaching methodology and evaluation process. Students should enjoy attending classes and learning lessons. They shouldn’t just be driven towards scoring good marks in semester exams,” said Ray.Thousands of engineering students switch to management or change streams since they don’t have the aptitude to excel in hard-core engineering, say teachers. “This is probably more true for Kolkata than many other cities. Every year, I come across scores of students who would have excelled in basic sciences or in some completely different stream. But they are forced by parental and peer pressure to take up engineering and struggle to complete the course,” added Ray. He cited the example of one of his former students, an IIT graduate, who couldn’t follow his heart and pursue mathematics.Rote learning is a major reason why colleges are churning out money-spinning professionals rather than innovative thinkers, say teachers. Even the IITs are guilty of driving students towards plum jobs, they admit. “Over the last decade, the focus has shifted from excellence in studies to landing a job with a five-figure salary. The system is geared towards that and this has somewhat undermined the importance of learning. As a result, aptitude has become secondary and everyone has joined the rat race,” said R V Rajakumar, professor, IIT-Kharagpur. 3 Idiots urges students to follow their heart and do what they love doing. “This may sound idealistic but nothing could be more true. An engineering degree might land you a job but won’t ensure success. Only with passion can you inspire students to think like Rancho and design innovative tools like he did for his students in the film. From the teaching point of view, projects and exercises need to be more realistic and interesting to encourage free thinking,” said Rajgopalan. But nothing could substitute strong infrastructure and a sound teaching system. “You cannot overhaul a system that has been successful. But we need to look beyond the conventional and change with the times,” said Partha Pratim Biswas, professor, Jadavpur University.Besu has realized the importance of innovative teaching and introduced discussion sessions that review the lessons taught in the course of a week. “We also enact dramas over engineering problems that help to hold students’ interest and teaches them to apply what they have learnt,” said Ray. -------------Here, I am! A very very good film. A good way to send a serious message, the fun part was never missed. While all the seniors - parents, faculty members are shown as villain (except one - when Aamir Khan becomes teacher), the student community except one is spared. My experience as an engineering student in no distant past was not the one where student community in general are bubbling with innovative spirit, neither is the case now. People prefer safer, proven track and are risk averse. Today in another article I read Ex-President Kalam asked scientists not to mind initial failures. We have not learnt to accept failures.In the TOI report the faculty members appear to be defensive. May be the reporter picked up only those quotes that suit the story. The faculty members at IITkgp very much encourage innovation, give marks even if the definition is not 'bookish' and there is a very very cordial teacher-student relation. Few weeks back I heard a teacher saying, \"I increased everybody's grade by one, the students were pleading so much!\" While some other teacher won't do that but there is never such a case where a good performance is given a bad grade. I cannot say the same for a bad performance which often gets good grades.The film narrative requires people, institutions to be painted in black and white - good and bad, for easy consumption of audience. Life is  not like that. It is different shades of gray. Let us accept the portrayal of characters in filmy spirit and take the message that \"All is not well\" and we can do a lot and the teacher-student division is anything but artificial as far as innovative spirit is concerned."},

Now, a study claims that chastised youngsters indeed do better in life.    An international team has carried out the study and found that young children smacked by their parents grow up to be happier and more successful than those who have never been hit, the Sunday Times reported.     They have based their findings on an analysis of detailed questioning of 179 teenagers who were asked how old they were when they were last smacked and how often they were smacked as a child.    The study found that kids smacked up to the age of six were more likely as teenagers to perform better at school, carry out volunteer work and go to university than their peers who were never physically disciplined. Only those children who continued to be smacked into adolescence showed clear behavioural problems, the study reported.

It is true that the majority of ABVYM members are from rural background but there are others ... and it was long overdue. The first day (26.12.2009), I visited the camp Benida (my mentor at Kharagpur unit of ABVYM) who was in bookstall at camp entrance took some time out and introduced me to Arunavada, the website designer. Arunavada is from Kalyani unit of ABVYM and works in a private firm in Kolkata. It is great to see how beautifully he manages his time and dedicates it to nation building activity. He has also started contributing articles in Vivek-Jivan, the mouthpiece of ABVYM. He is also a good orator, discussing how to start, conduct study circles in afternoon session of the camp. No wonder Nabanida (Nabaniharan Mukhopadhyaya, founder secretary) was in all praise of him.On 26th up journey, I took the route via Balichak. This required an extra rail link. After that, I took the via Makrampur route. Kept cycle in Koushalya More, then 30 min. bus ride to Makrampur and then 45 minute trekker ride to Basantapur Jhareshwar Bani Bhaban, the camp site. The impressive infrastructure was built by a generous donation of a son of the soil who returned after serving in US.The second day Ranjitda and others forced me to go to Nabanida's room. I was reluctant as he was taking rest after Q&A session. But not only he allowed me inside, kept conversing for more than two hours. I left when Birenda (Birendra Kumar Chakraborty, current secretary) and other senior camp officials entered his room to give them the opportunity to discuss camp issues. Nabanida asked me to give my address and other details. He wanted to keep that in his diary. At that time he kept it in his prayer book 'Stabkusumanjali'. He said many things. One I would like to mention here. He said, a person may have all the qualities but a little bit of ego disturbs everything.After that, Arnavada introduced me to his deputy a young lad, a lovely boy who is now going to Chennai for an IT sector job. Met Bangalore unit's Raghunath. Swami Tanmayananda (earlier a Mahamndal member) had some desire to visit IITkgp campus but finally said 'No'.The last day (Note the rejoinder at the end) I visited was yesterday. Ruhidas (a Kharagpur unit member now in Bankura, got a high school job) joined the camp then with prior permission from Birenda. Ruhidas has started one study circle near his school from where 4 are attending camp and has revived the Bankura town unit .. a great worker, nay leader indeed. He and Prabodhda (President, Kharagpur unit) shared some worry with me regarding Kharagpur unit. Salutation to Prabodhda for his great resolve and patience in guiding the young members when other seniors are, serving other units of the district or otherwise. A post annual camp discussion is planned on 17th Jan. as I shall be away to Vijaywada for attending a conference during 6-9th Jan.Had some wonderful moments with Ranjitda (Balibhara unit), clicked a pic together with Dipakda with Ma Sarada in background. Sukhenduda (Bhogpur unit) was a great host..always eager to feed me something. Prabhatda (Khakurda unit) was too very accommodating. Jagadishda(Naryangarh unit) helped me to catch a bus in a return journey when there was no sight of a trekker and I was somewhat worried. And it was great to see those smiling faces who are putting up a great job year after year ... I wish I could take all the names. Sorely missed Shuvendu, my friend in the camp. Heard that he is in Bangalore, went to China for some job ... How could he miss the camp? This was the place where we used to meet once a year!The final day took some pics. They can be found in http://picasaweb.google.com/gsaha.iitkgp/AVYMCamp2009#I am not able to write post on NSSCamp2009 held a month back because I am yet to get pics/feedback from  the students who immediately proceeded to vacation. We are going to have a dinner meet on 1st Jan. Shall take up the issue.--------------------REJOINDERYesterday, in our regular TUE study circle at F-127, Main Building I talked about the camp and today second half 13 of us visited the camp (3 of them faculty members) in two vehicles. It was a wonderful experience of all concerned, to see another side of India rising from the masses (so called ordinary people) without political noise, tv or newspaper coverage. Thirteen of us (3 of them faculty members) went in two vehicles. After visiting some of us opined that we little know about what is India. Often we underestimate so called ordinary people, dhoti clad, poorly dressed. A gathering of thirteen hundred young men for 6 days in a training camp to blossom one's life and dedicate the same to nation building .. is a wonderful sight. We talked to few people. It is astonishing to see the resolve, the disciplined nature, the compassion for fellow being. Almost everybody inquired us, the visitors if we had taken tiffin with the campers ... we had, it was simple but delicious. We saw people coming from different places, mostly villages, small town and from different parts of country. In the short time, met one from as far as Gujrat and he is not a Bengalee visiting home state. The ones we talked to belong to small study circles in respective places and depending on their capacity they take up philanthropic work. But the focus is on building oneself so that every act of one becomes a service and social service is not seen as a separate compartment."},

Shezad Ibrahimi, a PhD in Urdu from JNU runs a dhaba which on average caters to 100 students a day enjoys 'not having to report to anybody'. His independence reflect in the menu which changes everyday - \"Main jo banata hoon, dilchaspi se banata hoon. If I’m not in the mood to make biryani, you’ll not get it here\". The surprise does not end here. What one expects as the reaction of the family members for such an unorthodox approach?His wife, Mona Gupta is on the verge of completing her PhD thesis. She helps Shezad between 'minding kids and research'. Shezad is in all praise of his wife's independent spirit - \"Woh apne man ki rani hai, main apne man ka raja hoon\".They are really Royal dictating terms of their own lives. Hat's off to this couple!---------------A PhD from JNU, he runs a dhaba on campus now Shreya Roy Chowdhury | TNN   Dec. 23, 2009    Shehzad Ibrahimi runs a dhaba at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). He also has a PhD in Urdu from the same university. It is not quite the career he had in mind while writing his thesis on the concept of ‘hero’ in Qazi Abdur Sattar’s historical novels. But Shehzad has no regrets being the mamu of Mamu’s Dhaba. “I enjoy not having to report to anybody. Besides, I really enjoy cooking. I am doing fine,” says the 37-year-old from Bihar’s Sheikhpura district.    With lunch hour approaching, he darts about the small kitchen keeping up a lively conversation with his assistants. Shehzad honed his culinary skills at a Nalanda madrasa where he churned out dal-sabzi when the bawarchis took leave. Later, at college in Patna and in JNU, birthday parties became his responsibility as students came to know of his skills.    Shehzad never had any particular career in mind. After completing his MPhil, he worked as news anchor with a Hyderabad-based Urdu TV channel for nearly two years, quitting when a transfer to Varanasi seemed imminent. By then, he was married with two kids. Thankfully, he had the skills and the confidence needed to run a food joint. Permitted to start a canteen at JNU’s School of Physical Sciences, he wrote his thesis alongside, submitting it the same year, 2002.    It’s not much use now (“You don’t need a PhD to chop onions”); the Urdu background manifests itself only in the flourishes in his lettering, visible as the day’s menu on the whiteboard and in the tendency to suddenly break into poetry to illustrate a point. He is writing a book — a collection of recipes. “I have all the material,” he says, which means he has tried them out on his customers and they have approved.    Now established, Shehzad can afford to be temperamental. His mood determines what is on offer. “Main jo banata hoon, dilchaspi se banata hoon. If I’m not in the mood to make biryani, you’ll not get it here,” he declares. The menu changes every day. His chicken bhujiya was a hit, but now the recipe has been archived and can’t be had at Mamu’s for love or money. His relationship with korma too blows hot and cold. The one constant is the Bihari thaali — bhaat, dal, tarkari, chokha and chutney— for Rs 25.     A hundred people eat here every day, 180 on a good one. Shehzad promises wholesome fare. “It’s a family joint, never been any trouble here,” says Mamu, having earned the moniker when a friend’s nephew visiting JNU shouted ‘mamu-mamu’ from the audience as Shehzad sang on stage. “His classmates started calling me ‘mamu’ and then everyone,” he says. As a ‘senior’ to most of his clientele, he spices things up with easy banter, taking the liberty of yelling when they get impatient.    They also enquire after mami, Mona Gupta, on the verge of completing a thesis on Bali. Between minding the kids and research, Mona helps when she can. “Woh apne man ki rani hai, main apne man ka raja hoon,” he says. Mamu loves his dhaba but doesn’t plan to let JNU be the last stop on his road to culinary greatness. “My wish is to start a big restaurant,” he says. ---------------"},

Today I found the following article in TOI which is worth noting. The resolve of these school students of age 16 and 17 to 'resist the lure of the log in' may be the beginning of a backlash....or it may be too early to say that. That it is an issue getting noted among the youth is a good sign. Rest is in the article.------------------Teens ‘defriend’ to deal with online obsession Katie Hafner     Facebook, the popular networking site, has 350 million members worldwide who, collectively, spend 10 billion minutes there every day, checking in with friends, writing on people’s electronic walls, clicking through photos and generally keeping pace with the drift of their social world.    Make that 9.9 billion and change. Recently, Halley Lamberson, 17, and Monica Reed, 16, juniors at San Francisco University High School, made a pact to help each other resist the lure of the login. Their status might as well now read, “I can’t be bothered.”    “We decided we spent way too much time obsessing over Facebook and it would be better if we took a break from it,” Halley said. By mutual agreement, the two friends now allow themselves to log on to Facebook on the first Saturday of every month — and only on that day.     The two are among the many teenagers, especially girls, who are recognizing the huge distraction Facebook presents — the hours it consumes every day, to say nothing of the toll it takes during finals and college applications,according to parents, teachers and the students themselves.    Some teenagers, like Monica and Halley, form a support group to enforce their Facebook hiatus. Others deactivate their accounts. Still others ask someone they trust to change their password and keep control of it until they feel ready to have it back.    Facebook will not reveal how many users have deactivated service, but Kimberly Young, a psychologist who is the director of the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery in Bradford, Pennsylvania, said she had spoken with dozens of teenagers trying to break the Facebook habit. “It’s like any other addiction,” Young said. “It’s hard to wean yourself.” NYT NEWS SERVICE"},

He was speaking at the West Bengal Medical Convention organized by the Nationalistic Doctors’ Forum.    “Pharmaceutical companies send doctors on foreign trips and load them with gifts. So, instead of giving normal free medicines and some that are cheaper, the doctors prescribe medicines to please these companies whose hospitality and patronage they enjoy. This is not a healthy practice. However, there is no law at the moment to prohibit the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors. We are going to ban this soon,” Azad said.

The other day another article came where a 'beggar' family owning a two storied house in Bhubaneshwar earns greater than Rs.25000 p.m. by beggging - the male member complaining that his wife has became lazy, else they could have earned more. They also lend money to traders. I also heard that there are begging syndicates which auction train, foot path etc. and other beggars are not allowed there. Today's article also says \"begging is a punishable offence.\" Are we serious? Also, how to seek help when somebody is in distress and considers begging as the only option? Can the local youth organizations create a helpdesk and look at the merit of each case and act as a facilitator? They may approach local councillor, block development officer etc. - act as an interface between the needy and the Government. How to put a system in place?-----------------Nanny sedates baby, rents out to beggars in B’loreTIMES NEWS NETWORK Bangalore: This would beggar belief. As soon as the parents would kiss their little one goodbye, the nanny would feed him and get him ready for the day — not one full of fun and frolic, but for begging on the streets of Bangalore. Instead of giving milk to the baby, she would feed him sedatives; instead of nice warm clothes his parents had picked, she would dress him up in rags. That’s not all. She would hand the baby to beggars for Rs 100 a day and stay back at her employers’ home, watch soaps and feed herself to her heart’s content. This is the chilling tale of a seven-month-old baby of a working couple, who — relying on their ayah recruited from an employment agency (hence considered safe) — found their child was being abused. The horrifying tale surfaced when the nanny was caught by the child’s mother — she works in an MNC — who returned home early one day. She saw the ayah sitting in front of TV, but the baby was missing. Taken aback, she confronted her, who confessed to renting the child for begging for the past three weeks. The parents realized why their baby was drowsy and inactive in the evenings — he was being sedated every day but for weekends when the couple would be home. Strangely, they have not lodged a police complaint. “The parents want to remain anonymous and don’t want to even talk about it,” a source said. They are reportedly planning to move abroad. It isn’t clear if the incident has forced them to take the step. According to State Children Commission officials, a suo motu case will be filed against the nanny. “We are trying to track the family and get more details of the crime. As begging is a punishable offence, stringent action will be taken against the culprit. The panel will meet on Friday to decide on the course of action."},
{"title": "Talent", "date": "Friday, October 23, 2009", "text": "Hat's off! Short, sweet, sharp. Chetan Bhagat at it again. Let us all look at ourselves at individual and organizational level as mentioned towards the end of the article. It may take time to change at organizational level. Can we make a start at the individual level? Once it becomes a way of life for many of us, it would be easier to change at orgn. level. Hope, nobody puts up a chicken-egg issue here, who would blink first. If this is something good, let me go for it.---------------------From today's Times of IndiaWhere’s My Nobel Prize?We in India have to acknowledge talent as a source of inspiration, not resentmentChetan Bhagat The recent news of a person of Indian origin winning the Nobel prize while based abroad sparked off a series of discussions at home. “Why don’t we win Nobel prizes here?” became the question of the week. The standard points were raised: we don’t have the facilities, too much government interference, the selection process is rigged, the prize committee is racist and, finally, who cares about the Nobel anyway (of course we do, that’s why we discuss it).     Like all media stories, this one too will die soon. However, maybe it is time to look at the core issue: why India doesn’t excel on the world stage on a fairly consistent basis. We don’t win a significant number of Olympic medals, we don’t create global brands, our IT industry is essentially a job transfer model but we haven’t created even one Google, Facebook or Twitter. (Of course, there is plenty for Indians to be proud of otherwise, so please don’t jump on me because of my observations.)     The real issue comes down to the treatment of talent in our country. So, what is talent? Talent refers to a special ability and aptitude that give people an edge in a particular field. In sport, science, films, business or the arts, people who dominate the world stage all have a gift that makes it easier for them to excel. Of course, along with talent there is preparation, hard work and a certain amount of luck required to achieve success. However, talent is usually a necessary ingredient. Talent is rare, and randomly distributed across the human population, irrespective of pedigree, connections or wealth. Some may call talent an unfair gift. However, it is talent that allows ordinary people to come up in life. Otherwise, rich people would stay rich and poor people poor. Thus, this unfair talent actually makes the world fairer.     However, we don’t put talent on the highest pedestal in our country. Talent’s stature is below that of someone with connections, hereditary entitlement, pedigree or even experience. If i were to tell you that an unknown boy from Agra will become the next superstar, versus a star’s son becoming the next star, the latter story is much easier to digest. Even in an IIT, a truly gifted young faculty cannot jump ranks and scales set by the system. And the people designing the system never took talent into account. Even when talent is identified, we are unable to train it, and find it difficult to reward it.     It is difficult to say why we have this attitude, but there are many possible reasons. One, talent conflicts with the traditional Indian caste system. Two, Indian cultural values revere the older generation and its experience, and talent zooms past it. Finally, the ‘tall poppies syndrome’, an already existing term used in Australia and UK to “describe a societal phenomenon in which people of genuine merit are criticised or resented because their talents or achievements elevate them above or distinguish them from their peers”. Ask yourself, have you seen some of this in India? Maybe because so many dreams have been crushed in India, someone else’s success reminds us of our own pain. The US (only as a contrasting example, not recommending we become like them) has an opposite value system. Talent is respected, seen as something to be emulated. That is why they have teenage boy bands and college dropouts who open dotcoms as national icons. We don’t.     There are grave negative repercussions for a community that doesn’t respect talent. It leads to a society where connected people do better than people with ability. It leads to a lot of talent being unused, a tremendous waste of a national resource. It causes frustration in the entire new generation as they see people with less capability doing better than them. It also reinforces the old Indian values of fatalism and the helpless-common-man theory. And it means India’s excellent people may not excel worldwide to the extent possible.     So what can be done? Well, we definitely can do something – both at the macro organisational level and a micro individual level.     At the organisational level, we have to let go of corporate hierarchies and the lifelong promotion ladders of government, particularly in talent-dependent organisations like R&D, companies requiring high innovation or sport. We have to make incentives in line with what attracts talent, as there is a global battle for it. Exceptional talent demands exceptional reward. We have to take away the moral judgement associated with rewarding talent. Just as it is morally okay for a rich man’s son to be rich, a person with talent also deserves to do really well.     Change needs to happen amongst us, at the individual level as well. We have to acknowledge that talent exists, and we need to respect it. Frankly, isn’t it better a talented person gets rewarded than a minister’s son? Talent shouldn’t cause resentment, it should become an inspiration. I think the young generation is already on board with that. It needs the older generation’s support to make this change in values. It may be difficult, but it is worth it.     Because if we do become a talent-driven country, we will become a more progressive nation, utilise the new generation’s skills properly, become a fairer society and, along the way, win a few Nobel prizes too.When are we going to see this in India? From today's edition of Times of India ...---------------Tax us to fight economic crisis: Rich GermansBerlin: Some rich Germans have launched a petition to call for the resumption of a wealth tax to help the country bounce back from an economic crisis, because, as one said, he had “a lot of money I do not need”.     The text, posted on the internet at www.appell-vermoegensabgabe.de, has been signed by more than 40 people who want to convince the government of newly reelected Chancellor Angela Merkel to raise their taxes.     For retired doctor Dieter Kelmkuhl, 66, it is time the wealthy came to the aid of their country. He reckons that if the 2.2 million Germans who have personal fortunes of more than $750,000 paid a tax of five percent this year and next, it would provide the state with 100 billion euros.     Kelmkuhl got the idea when Berlin stumped up billions of euros to save banks and give the recession-hit economy a boost.     “It made me mad to think that we suddenly found all this money for the banks, money that we did not have before for urgent programmes like education and the environment,” the left-of-centre weekly Die Zeit quoted him as saying.     The former doctor would like Germany to have its own version of the the US group United for a Fair Economy (UFA), which includes around 700 wealthy US residents, according to the left-of-centre daily Tagesspiegel."},
{"title": "Humanity Hospital", "date": "Sunday, October 18, 2009", "text": "No more excuse, please! I heard this before in one of the guest lecture at IITkgp. The lady, the central character sells vegetables in Sealdah, Kolkata market. Had temendous will and perseverence and of course purity of thought, life. That helped her to collect one rupee a day from other sellers of the market for the dream hospital. The following is from page 2 of Kolkata edition of Times of India.---------------------------MOTHER COURAGEShe sold vegetables and her son grew up at a home for destitute children. But Subhashini Mistry still went on to set up a hospital that treats thousands of patients for free. They just call her Ma — a woman with a mighty heart. Prithvijit Mitra reports   Subhashini Mistry treads gently on the lawn, searching for weeds and undergrowth that she deftly plucks out from under the cycas trees. Bending low, she caresses the petals and waters the potted plants. But every once in a while, she instinctively turns around to take a proud look at a three-storey building overlooking a little patch of green that’s come up in the middle of nowhere.    That building is, first, a miracle. A testimony to the 72-year-old widow’s grit, determination and impossible altruism; it’s also a hospital. The name, Humanity Hospital, couldn’t have been more apt. Because healthcare is for free here, along with lots of love and affection.    The hospital at Hanspukur, on the southern fringes of Kolkata, was set up 13 years ago by Subhashini and her doctor son Ajoy to ensure that no one in their largely impoverished village went unattended or uncared for. They have found 20 doctors who work for free. “If you hear her story, you too won’t have the heart to ask for pay for work done at the hospital,’’ said a doctor. “This is service like I have never seen before.’’    Subhashini’s story is a staggering account of what human will can achieve, of indomitable spirit, of a rise, phoenix like.    It was in 1971, after her husband died — poor, ill, and without any money for treatment — that she vowed no one in her village would end up that way. But the dream was easier dreamt than brought to fruition.    “The eldest of my children was seven and the youngest just a year-and-a-half when my husband died,’’ Subhashini said. “We didn’t have money for the doctor’s fees and he died without treatment. That day, I pledged no other woman in my village would go through what I did.”    But the journey she embarked on was riddled with hardships and obstacles. She started by collecting vegetables from neighbours and selling them at a local market for a small margin. She saved from whatever little she earned. Her neighbours laughed at her and relatives felt she was out of her mind. “Two of my sons worked in a tea stall. We survived on boiled rice for years. I couldn’t even send them to school,” Subhashini recalled. “I knew my children had to go to school and at least one had to be a doctor, or else my dream would never come true. So, I decided to turn into a proper vegetable vendor, without depending on my neighbours.”    Ajoy, the third son, looked the most likely candidate to help fulfil her dream. He was a brilliant student even as he grew up in a children’s home. “My mother could not afford to send me to school. But she wanted us to study seriously, which we did. I was initially not keen on taking up medicine. In fact, I studied chemistry because I felt that was my subject,” said Ajoy, now 47.    It left Subhashini disheartened, but she willed herself to fight on — even without a doctor in the family. By then, though, both mother and son had saved up enough to buy a piece of land at Hanspukur. Slowly, neighbours, now beginning to admire her tenacity, contributed generously. “The land for Humanity Hospital was purchased in 1992, and construction began three years later. When the hospital was inaugurated in 1996, it was just a single-storey structure, barely 3,000 sq ft in area. But it came as a ray of hope for people in the Hanspukur-Bankrahat area,” Ajoy said.    Ajoy changed track, too, and in 1990, after clearing the joint entrance examination, enrolled at Calcutta Medical College Hospital. He graduated a year before the foundation stone for Humanity Hospital was laid.    With 35 beds and 13 departments — including general medicine, gynaecology, paediatrics, eye, surgery, immunology and cardiology — the hospital stands as the lone symbol of optimism in a neglected terrain where treatment was considered a luxury. It caters to more than 10,000 people, and patients travel from farflung villages like Shakharipota, Mahishgot, Kalmikhali, Kakdweep, Kalagacchia, Diamond Harbour, parts of East Midnapore and even Bangladesh. Nobody is refused treatment. And no money is ever asked for.    Subhashini and Ajoy spend more than 16 hours at the hospital every day. She struts about the hospital like a protective mother hen, visiting each bed, holding hands and talking to patients. “For us, this is our world. The patients are like my own children,” Subhashini said. Ajoy, on his part, never regrets having chosen to dedicate his life for the cause of the poor. “I don’t know when I started sharing my mother’s vision. But it was pretty early in life,” he said.    But there is no end in sight to the struggle that started in 1971. It’s a daily battle to keep the hospital running. Donors and sponsors have lent a helping hand. LIC Golden Jubilee Foundation, for instance, funded the construction of the second floor recently, but it’s never enough. Ajoy said, “At present, we need Rs 64,000 a month to run the hospital. If we have to augment the facilities, we would require Rs 3 lakh. We need more donors and perhaps some patients who can afford to pay basic charges.”    On his mother’s suggestion, Ajoy helped 100 villagers get medical insurance, but this number is just a drop in the ocean. “We need more such schemes to make Humanity a bigger institution. But it will always cater to the poor and the neglected. Whatever the cost.’’ No one will doubt Subhashini or her son on this."},
{"title": "Musing 2", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2009", "text": "In today's Times of India, the interview brings out more of 'Venki' Ramakrishnan. Let's try to understand what he wants to say and imbibe the spirit.-----------------------------‘A little less nationalistic hero worship please’— Venki RamakrishnanIam distressed by the reaction to my comment about being deluged by emails from India, and realize I have inadvertently hurt people, for which I apologize. I hope people realize that I have no personal secretary and use my email mainly for work, so finding important communications became very difficult. I want to make it clear that I was delighted to hear from scientific colleagues and students whom I had met personally over the years in India and elsewhere, as well as close friends with whom I had lost touch. Unlike real celebrities like movie stars or people in sports, we scientists generally lead a quiet life, and are not psychologically equipped to handle publicity. So, I found the barrage of emails from people whom I didn’t know or whom I only knew slightly almost 40 years ago (nearly all from Indians) difficult to deal with. People have also taken offence at my comment about nationality being an accident of birth. However, they don’t seem to notice the first part of the sentence: We are all human beings. Accident or not, I remain grateful to all the dedicated teachers I had throughout my years. Others have said I have disowned my roots. Since 2002, I have come almost every year to India. In these visits, I have spent time on institute campuses giving lectures or talking to colleagues and students about their work, and stayed in the campus guest house. I have not spent my time staying in fancy hotels and going sightseeing without them. The people I visited, eg at the ICGEB in Delhi, CCMB in Hyderabad, the University of Madras or the IISc in Bangalore can vouch for this. Finally, at a personal level, although I am westernized, many aspects of culture like a love for classical Indian music or South Indian or Gujarati food are simply a part of me. The best way to take pleasure in someone’s achievement is to take an interest in their work and feel motivated to learn more about science. I remember reading about Gellman’s work as an undergraduate in Baroda, and, when he won the Nobel prize, rushing upstairs to tell my parents. It did not matter to me whether he was Indian or not. In my case, I am lucky to have had a combination of education, opportunities and a great team of co-workers to have made a contribution to an important problem. I am not personally that important. If I hadn’t existed, this work would still have been done. It is the work that is important, and that should be what excites people. Finally, there are many excellent scientists in India and elsewhere who will never win a Nobel prize. But their work is no less interesting and people should find out about what they do. My visits to India confirm that it has great potential and bright young students. A little less nationalistic hero worship will go a long way to fulfil that potential.Excerpts of an interview of Nobel prize winner 'Venki' Ramakrishnan that has some important messages for all Indian and more specifically for those who are Indian S & T sphere. It appeared in today's edition of The Telegraph.------------------Ramakrishnan understands why Indians the world over are bathing in his reflected glory but he is keen to use the occasion of an interview with The Telegraph to urge them not to get too jingoistic.“I don’t think they should make too much of it,” he says. “Fundamentally, it is not important that it was an Indian who did this.”Now 57, he left India at 19 and lived in the US ....He focuses on his science but he does have a life outside the lab. “I have lots of personal interests. I love music, I love bicycling and hiking and my wife and I went on a cycling trip in Norfolk last month. ”He is vegetarian and tries out Gujarati and South Indian dishes when he has friends to dinner. “I like cooking occasionally.”Will Ramakrishnan’s life now change beyond recognition? “I hope not. I wrote to a Swedish friend of mine, a major figure in the field of science, (and joked) ‘What have you guys done to me?’ and he said, ‘Don’t worry, you will be bothered for a little while and then life will be back to normal’.”His computer has been clogged by unsolicited emails from Indians.“I sometimes get the feeling that people in India think of it as some kind of sporting event that their man won but science isn’t like that,” he smiles.He doesn’t want the Nobel to be seen in narrow, nationalistic terms. “It’s very bad. Science is done for the pursuit of knowledge. It is not done to represent your national team. It has no national boundaries whatsoever. This is the thing that people need to realise.”He gives the example of his own lab in Cambridge, where he is the 29th Nobel Prize winner in an elite list that includes Crick & Watson, the pair that unlocked the double helix of the DNA. “My own lab has two Chinese, a Malaysian, a Canadian, an American, a German, it has had all sorts of people. And it’s actually fun because people from different countries come together, they have cultural exchanges, they learn more about each others’ countries and way of life. Science is a great international mixer, so the idea that it is a sort of cricket match where our team won — that simply is a wrong way of looking at scientific discovery.”To be sure, he hopes the cause of science has received a boost. “It’s an absolutely good thing. I can think of one even better thing for young people, especially in India. It shows them you can study in India, get your basic education in India and you can (then) do whatever you want after that. That’s a very important message.”He says: “Indians tend to be a little insecure and they should stop being insecure — I have visited India many times and I can tell you questions I get after my talks are as perceptive as anywhere else in the world, including places like Harvard or MIT. It’s perfectly fine to take pride that someone from their region has used their background and succeeded. That gives them a positive message that they can do anything that they want.”He argues that “if India had 50 Nobel Prizes, they wouldn’t bother. For instance, in the US I was interviewed on the day of the Nobel Prize, it went into the major papers, news media and then they said, ‘Fine, another year when a few Americans have won Nobel prizes’, that was it. They did not have this almost exaggerated reaction. That comes from a sort of feeling of insecurity about their (India’s) standing in the world. But India is not the same as it was 50 years ago.”He stresses: “Now many excellent scientists in India are doing really first rate work and it should not matter when the next Indian Nobel Prize is because they are doing very good work — that is what matters and the more you have this infrastructure, with good scientists within India, eventually someone will get a Nobel Prize for work done within India.”He gives examples. “There are already people who are world class in India, for example C.N.R. Rao (who has worked mainly in solid-state and structural chemistry). He is an example of how you can do first rate international work within India. So I would say to Indians — you have it within you to do this (in India).”"},

He was a lecturer in modern history at the then University of Rhodesia, a post-doctoral research fellow at London School of Economics and, from 1983, a teacher, housemaster and headmaster in several British public and international schools. I wish, all of us connected to academics - the students, the teachers, the guardians take his words seriously, as a service to ourselves if not anything else.----------------What is the role of education?     The role of education is to ensure that children become lifelong learners. Today, a narrow and stifling academic curriculum in most countries has led students to disengage themselves from the testing regime of the education system. Students are no longer intellectually robust. We need to create a critical mass of thinkers. True learning often takes place outside the classroom. I, therefore, encourage my students to excel in sports, arts, also recently we launched the Model UN, and so on.     What is your vision for the Doon School?     It is to create thinking individuals. I would request parents to come to us only if they want to develop their child’s character and creativity. On the way, we will also help the child to get decent grades. It is important to remember that your life is not over if your academic scores are not high."},

The Q & A is published in today's edition of Economic Times. To a sceptic I would like to say, if you see something different around you it is primarily because (i) we seniors have not empowered them properly with right education, values... in our own pursuit of selfishness and (ii) they are kind of defocussed, distracted by the environment they were raised from early childhood (the negative thoughts, vibes). If someone can do it, it is the youth of India ... once they lay their focus on personal and social malady ... waiting for that sunshine day.Now the excerpt.--------You mentioned  recently that India is not a land of a million problems but a land of million  opportunities. What kind of opportunity would you like your children to pursue  when they get into business? Well more than my own  children I’m amazed when I see the commitment levels in young Indians (which) is  the real strength of India.

{"title": "Rewind", "date": "Friday, October 9, 2009", "text": "I was listening to a vivid panel discussion on Nobel prize and contribution of Indian or India born scientist. One veteran panelist, Pathik Guha narrated Subrahmanyan Chandresekhar's view on Indian Science from his biography written by Kameswar Rao.Chandrasekhar opines that in pre-1930 days, there was a tremendous urge from the Indian Science community to deliver the best, to show the world that they though subjugated by British were also at par. And it bore fruit. Many of us drew the attention of the world. Post 1930, he observes, something strange happend and the downfall began. What was that? The seniors tried to cling to their position and the junior, younger scientists were not encouraged or allowed to grow!Strong views. I looked for the biography on the web. Instead, I got some other. Let me put few lines from http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/apr252000/generalia.pdf--------------Chandra kept himself informed of what was happening in Indian science and was surprisingly well aware of the political scene – science politics that is. Although he was totally uninvolved in all this, he was ready to deal with administrators in order to help the deserving. Cases such as that of Smt. Janaki Ammal, wife of Ramanujan, may be well known. But there are many other obscure cases in which Chandra went out of his way to meet heads of institutions to make his recommendations. His efforts were not always rewarded nor were they universally appreciated. At least in one instance when he tried to recommend a scientist for promotion that was long overdue, he was told in no unequivocal terms that as a foreigner, he had no idea of how the Indian science machinery worked and was asked not to interfere. This hurt Chandra deeply. All the same, he did not stop helping others.------------So, what Pathik Guha says may not be off the mark. Hope, it is corrected to a great extent or in the process of being corrected. Further quotes from this biography.------------I met Chandra again in 1993 at his brother Balakrishnan’s house where he was staying on a private visit. We sat in the verandah watching the little garden. It was late afternoon, bright sunlight playing upon the flowers. As the day wore on, light faded and shadows lengthened. Chandra asked me to move closer to him so he could hear better. He looked tired. But, as usual, he asked me in detail about my research. Then he went on to discuss a composite picture of what he had done in recent years. He was satisfied that his work on Principia was progressing well. Then came Indian science – research institutions, universities. A short pause. He looked up with a tinge of melancholy and said, ‘You know the worst thing one could do to science? Use it for self promotion.... It is sad that people think I cannot see what is happening. For instance...’. His voice trailed off as he closed his eyes. ‘Another time, perhaps...’ he added in a whisper. Depression seemed to be coming on. It was time to change the subject. I started talking about science education, the need to communicate science in the proper manner, creating opportunities for the young, conveying the excitement of new developments through interaction with practising scientists. Chandra opened his eyes. He was alert now. ‘When you were a student, you met Sommerfeld,’ I said, ‘wasn’t that an important occasion?’ According to Kameshwar Wali, Chandra described this meeting as ‘the single most important’ event in his early life which launched him on a research career. Chandra sat up. His keen, piercing eyes were sparkling now. He said with emphasis, ‘Yes, indeed’. He kept nodding as I continued. ‘But how many students could have the good fortune of meeting someone like Sommerfeld? And how many would be prepared, as you were, to make use of such an opportunity? Yet, if we create the proper atmosphere and facilities, some motivated children may grow into good scientists, even great ones. Maybe, we will have another Chandra, who knows’. He looked at me wistfully, apparently moved, and asked, ‘Are you going to do that?’ ‘I would like to try,’ I replied. ‘If you do that,’ Chandra said, ‘I should like to come and see it’."},
{"title": "Proud Father", "date": "Wednesday, October 7, 2009", "text": "From rediff.com, today's edition, titled 'Nobel winner does not own a car, cycles to work'------------\"When the Secretary of the Nobel Committee called my son in London  [ Images ], he said 'you must be kidding with me and trying to fool me,\" his father said. The reason Venky thought so, the father explained, was that during this season when Nobel Laureates are selected, a lot of their friends make prank calls speaking in Swedish accent and trying to fool people. \"My son did not believe what he heard from the secretary until he spoke to the chairman of the Nobel Committee,\" he said. Nor did he. The senior Venkatraman got phone calls from local news papers 'wanting to talk to his son who has got a Nobel Prize' late at night without knowing that the latter does not live in Seattle. But he did not believe any of then until he asked them 'hundreds of questions' and was fully satisfied that his son actually got the Nobel Prize. \"A few hours later when Venky called his father to give him the good news, the senior told him that there was 'no excitement ' as he has already come to know about it. \"My son, who did not want to wake me up in the middle of the night, just laughed,\" he said. The father described his son as well his daughter Lalita Ramakrishna, a professor at the Infectious Diseases Center at the University of Seattle Medical Center, who is more into research than medical practice as people leading a simple and ordinary life. He said Venky does not own a car and goes to work in bicycle. \"He keeps a low profile. He is very helpful to people, especially young people, and will help them whether in terms of giving advice for their studies and above all he is very friendly with people,\" he said. \"He always keeps a very low profile and that is how he has been since he was a child,\" he said. Has his Nobel laureate son done anything apart from being steeped into research? The father said that Venky and his sister have been avid bicyclers and love trekking. \"Venky would go up to 25 miles bicycling. He is very interested in nature. So is his sister,\" he said. Both Venky and his sister, according to the father, have a benevolent streak. They both donate money to UNICEF, Ramakrishna Mission, of which their parents are great followers and to Doctors without Borders. Then he spills a secret. \"I do not think he is a very spiritually oriented person,\" he said in response to a question in the context of his son's philanthropy. \"He just likes to help people.\"Guess what I am thinking!CATCHING BRAIN SIGNALS Interaction through telepathy possible Washington: Researchers from the University of Southampton have shown that people can communicate with each other through the power of thought alone.    Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) can be used for capturing brain signals and translating them into commands that allow humans to control devices like computers, robots, rehabilitation technology, and virtual reality environments just by thinking about various actions.    Dr Christopher James, from the University’s Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, took the experiment a step further in the current study. The researchers aimed to expand the current limits of this technology, and show that brain-to-brain (B2B) communication is possible.    “Whilst BCI is no longer a new thing and person to person communication via the nervous system was shown previously in work by professor Kevin Warwick from the University of Reading, here we show, for the first time, true brain to brain interfacing.    In his experiment, one person used BCI to transmit thoughts, translated as a series of binary digits, over the internet to another person whose computer receives the digits and transmits them to the second user’s brain through flashing an LED lamp.    While attached to an EEG amplifier, the first person would generate and transmit a series of binary digits, imagining moving their left arm for zero and their right arm for one. The second person was also attached to an EEG amplifier and their PC would pick up the stream of binary digits and flash an LED lamp at two different frequencies, one for zero and the other one for one.    Although the pattern of the flashing LEDS is too subtle to be picked by the second person, but it is picked up by electrodes measuring the visual cortex of the recipient. The encoded information is then extracted from the brain activity of the second user and the PC can decipher whether a zero or a one was transmitted. The experiment, thus, showed true brain-to-brain activity. ANI"},

She continues, \" I suspected something was wrong with my health but we always push ourselves, don’t we? That has been a big lesson. I was relieved rather than hugely distressed to hear I had cancer..... I have been running around the globe for the last few years and neglected my personal needs.

It appears that the thought of dying makes huge difference. Death is evitable. Yet we don't want to acknowledge it. How about rebooting ourselves and make a restart to our life and enjoy it at its fullest, make the best of it?The other article is titled 'At Madrassas Hindu students make a mark'. One needs to dig deeper into the article to find that there is more than breaking of boundaries like Hindu-Muslim. I am talking about gender divide and the way we treat girl child and their education aspiration. The article says \"This year, Muslim girls both outnumbered and outshone boys in madarsa exam in Fauqania (equivalent to matric) and Wastania (equivalent to middle). ‘‘That more girls are joining madarsa and pursuing education is encouraging,’’ Ahmad said. He said enrolment of Muslim girls in all districts, including Muslim-dominated Kishangunj district, which has the lowest literacy among women, has increased.\"I see a healing touch to some of our wounds at personal and soceital space."},

The feast is on - the spiritual one!Yesterday evening I was sweetly surprised when two students came to our residence with Prasad after a Bhagabat study. The day before yesterday another two students from the same group came to invite us for this program. How much I like that the students are taking interests in studies like this! It was to be held from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. in Prof. - Rao's residence. By that time my Saturday evening was already planned. I said that I would try, if possible else next time.Yesterday afternoon as already discussed in Vivekananda Study Circle's TUE meet (and group mails), we assembled at IIT Prembazar gate at 5:00 p.m. Then we cycled towards a nearby Lodha settlement ina  village named Soladahar. Lodhas are one of the most bacward tribes in this part of the country. There is a primary school in that village that teaches up to Class IV. There is none there who has passed Class X (even after 60 years of independence) board exam. Met one young school drop out of class VIII. There are 6-7 students who are still continuing study in class V to VII in a high school situated at another village. The village head and the elders (that included lady members) showed lots of interest, enthusiasm when we proposed to assist them in children education. We met one boy and a girl from this V-VII group who too appeared quite interested and serious. The villagers said that earlier NSS volunteers used to visit on Saturday and Sunday and interact with primary school students. That inspired the students a lot. We plan to start an activity with some long term targets in the village. On our way back we discussed few models. We shall visit again to talk to their primary school teachers and make another survey on financial condition of the villagers. The children education program is to start after Durga Puja.Besides TUE study circle, on every WED institute lecture is being held at Kalidas auditorium (5:00-7:00 p.m.) where Ramakrishna Mission monks are discussing Gita as a part of lecture series on Indian heritage. I saw a notice in gmail that IIT Tech. Club is organizing a spiritual discourse where a monk from Kriyayog order will deliver talk. And now I learn that there is this monthly Bhagabat study where too students and Prof.s assemble and study together."},

Hero worship is in India's DNA. There are temples in the name of Sachin, Mahi, Amitabh, etc. We can debate whether it is good or bad, whether it should be changed or can be changed, how long that will take etc.. A better approach could be to channelize this emotion positively by springing up heros who think about them, care for them, live for them.

Even at IITkgp, while every faculty member is aggreived, the mode of protest, the 'boycotting of class' was not acceptable to a section of faculty members inspite of persuations from the other sections (some felt as intimidation, too). They prefer other modes of protests which are not disruptive. There was enough attempt though to make a hero out of people who boycotted the class and villain out of the ones who did not through passages like (which came out in open):\"Casual Leave on the 21st August should see no classes and no laboratories at IIT Kharagpur.Please do not ask the question: what have the others done? You do it first. Note down the names of those who did not cooperate. When the obituary of IIT system would be written, at least you can get the solace from the fact that you did whatever was asked of you.\"Read the line \"Note down the names\" of those who did not boycott class. There is a veiled threat.\"It should be enough for us if we could prove to ourselves that we, the IIT faculty, are not dead dogs who do not react however hard we are kicked on the back.\"The sarcasm : \"Some faculty members have called me up to inform that some have \"Freshers' Intro\" at 5 PM. Some have \"extra class\". Some have \"project defence\". So, they cannot come. After all, we are famous IIT faculty, known for our commitment and dedication.\"\"Unless we wake up from slumber and shake off our pseudo-elitism, probably, the time has come for all of us to write an obituary to the hallowed IIT system.\"There are many such instances.Personally speaking, I am horrified by the commanding tone in these open messages. As if, we now have two bosses at work place. One, the administrative one, Director via HOD. The other is the Teacher's Association. If they are in conflict, whom to obey? What does my service rule say? Can I not participate in a mode of protest that is not in conflict with my service rule?I have participated in black badge protest held before. Boycotting classes is above my threshold. I took class as usual though there was lot of pressure not to do that. I respect their view as much as they respect mine or the other section who did not boycott and that number is significant in IITkgp as well as other IITs as the news report says.Finally, I am much more disturbed by the conflict over the mode of protest than the cause of it, the division in rank and file because of it. I don't feel that not-so-high pay rise will affect the IIT System that much. But if others feel so, I value their opinion. When I took the job of an IIT faculty, salary was never an issue. It is not even today. As long as I get a good, peaceful work environment here, I care the least for the salary. What I get is sufficient for my family and the philanthropic activities I am engaged in. Also, IIT offers me other approved means of earnings by offering professional services which though irregular is substantial to me.The following to a great extent echoes my sentiment.From NDTV.com, a report by Manu Sharma, Thursday August 27, 2009, New Delhihttp://www.ndtv.com/news/india/professors_earn_rs_50000_at_iit_rs_5_lakh_at_harvard.php\"Dr Sandeep Sen studied at IIT Kharagpur, went to Duke University in the US for his doctorate, but despite many lucrative offers, chose to come back to his alma-mater to teach two decades ago.Now, as the faculty demands a pay hike, Sen says for him it was never about the money. What has upset him is people questioning the credibility of the faculty.\"They say there is no great research at IIT. I agree we could have done better, but at least acknowledge the good work. It is not about a few thousand rupees, it is about the recognition that comes, a kind of medal given for good work,\" says Dr Sen, who is heads electronic engineering at IIT Delhi.Dr Sourav Bansal, Sen's student and with a Phd from Stanford, could have his pick of jobs abroad. But like his mentor, he too came back to contribute to excellence in teaching.Dr Bansal, who is an assistant professor of electronics at IIT says: \"when I came for the interview I was told money would be very less, but I remembered the environment and wanted to come back. Be a leader in our technical revolution. And when we see that professors have to ask for this, it's not fair.\""},
{"title": "Success", "date": "Sunday, August 16, 2009", "text": "It is wonderful to go through views of people who have attained some amount of success in life...and business leaders are no exceptions.Long back I read what the leader of HCL Technologies had to say. It was a turn around story. The success mantra was (i) Focus (ii) Lead and (iii) Dominate. I wrote these three words in my office room blackboard to be constantly remided of. Yes, that was the time I found myself cornered, facing resistances from unexpected quarters and resolved to reinvent myself.Today I read the interview of Anand Mahindra in Economic Times. The four success mantra for his company, in his own words are :\"There are four mantras. Essentially, they have to do with businesses that are global or have global potential; businesses that have innovation as a measurable plank; certainly we also want to be leaders, preferably one or two in all the businesses in which we compete. Finally, the fourth mantra is financial — they have to do with free cash flow and return on capital employed. \"I also liked the other part of the interview where he talked about meritocracy in his organization. And he has no plan to put his siblings on top. This is a story on how a person joined M&M. One should also not miss the wisdom of the father in the story and how he advises his son.\"There’s a wonderful story that I always share in all the management gatherings. It’s about Bharat Doshi, our CFO. Many years ago, as a gold medalist accountant Bharat had to chose a job. He got two offers. One was from a Gujarati-owned company and another from M&M. He went to his father and asked him. His father said, ‘Get me the annual reports’. When he got the annual reports, his father looked at them and said ‘Choose M&M’.     And when Bharat Doshi asked why, he said, ‘Look, the Gujarati company has Patel & Patel, Shah & Shah. And M&M had an Ali Mohammed, a Pitambar, a D’Souza. There were a whole variety of people from across the country and he apparently told Bharat, ‘If you choose this company and you get to the top it will be because of your merit and not because of where you come from in this country.’ That’s an incredible legacy. And I think I’d have failed if I didn’t maintain that legacy. I’d like to think that it’s still maintained.\""},
{"title": "Swine Flu", "date": "Saturday, August 15, 2009", "text": "Last THU I had to travel to Mumbai for a project meeting. Family members were not happy. Pune is the hot spot of Swine Flu. My mother's first air travel to a relative's place in Pune is cancelled. Mumbai is not too far.  And it is also in news. However, this was an important meeting and few other from IITkgp were also travelling.At IIT Bombay, we did not see any panic. Neither the people on the street or airport appeared perturbed.  The life seemed to be all normal.This morning I read an interesting article on this written by none other than Swaminathan S A Aiyar (Times of India), one of my favourites, mostly for his contrarian view of life. He says, I quote -\"Swine flu has killed 21Indians so far, and may soon claim hundreds, even thousands. That is a tragedy. Even so, swine flu remains a very minor cause of death, far behind other diseases that kill millions. The panic generated by the media is unwarranted, and is worsening health outcomes. \"He is armed with statistics.\"(In India) we find that 1.37 million people die annually of respiratory diseases and infections, 7,20,000 of diarrhea, and 5,40,000 of tuberculosis. These are staggering numbers. They imply that on an average day, 3,753 people die of respiratory diseases and infections, 1,973 of diarrhea, and 1,479 of tuberculosis.\"Did we know that or cared to know? This was from a 2001-2003 report by Registrar General. Why media does not take note of it? Swami has a major point when he says -\"Seen in this light, 20-odd swine flu deaths are almost laughably trivial. I do not laugh, because every death is a tragedy. But i am infinitely sadder for the millions whose plight has been swept out of public view, and is actually being worsened by upper-class panic.Make no mistake, swine flu panic is substantially an upper class worry. Why do the media overflow with news of swine flu while ignoring other diseases that kill thousands every day? Because those everyday diseases are the problems of the poorer half of India, and the media target the upper half. Some upper class folk do get asthma or TB, but they are quickly treated and rarely die of these diseases. The millions who die come from the bottom half, lacking access to doctors and medicines. They die so regularly in millions that their deaths are no longer considered news. \"Swami may appear harsh but let us not miss the sympathy in his tone for those people who do not get it and need it more than others.\"Then along comes swine flu. It is a new disease, and that itself commands media attention. The richer half is terrified that not even its money and access to doctors provides safety. As a disease carried by air travellers, swine flu is a quintessential elite concern. Elite panic soon spreads to lower rungs of society, as the media project a new apocalypse. This is true across the world. Globally, swine flu has infected 1,77,000 people and killed 1,126. The numbers are trivial compared with deaths from malaria, respiratory disease or diarrhea. Yet, the global media focus on swine flu. \""},

Hope, people take note of these.  A much less important but satisfying personal experience is related to this year's convocation. My name as a student of IITKGP was called before during convocation. In this convocation, I was sweetly surprised when Director in his address mentioned my name. He read out a list of faculty members who got national level awards in last one year. I was watching the convocation with family from home on local cable TV network. The auditorum is too small to accommodate all. The family felt very proud. Later, during the convocation lunch, one senior professor from our Dept. expressed happiness and told that this made the Dept. proud. I think, it is sweeter than the award itself - that it is being enjoyed by all! Sibal raises bar for tech trophiesThe TelegraphNew Delhi, Aug. 8: The IITs must transform themselves into creators of knowledge rather than focus on undergraduate teaching, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said today, issuing a thinly veiled challenge to the apex engineering schools.Addressing the IIT Delhi convocation today, the minister also questioned the absence of “passion” to generate new knowledge among IIT students once they clear the entrance examination to the institutes.“Students come here after clearing one of the toughest examinations but then seem to lose their passion for creating new knowledge,” Sibal said, addressing graduating students, their parents and faculty at IIT Delhi.The minister called the IITs one of the country’s top technical education institutions but pointed out that the institutes faced fresh challenges as “expectations from you have grown”.“Very often, I am asked by people: ‘Oh, what’s so great about the IITs? Have they produced any Nobel laureates?’” the minister said.In defence of the IITs, Sibal said they were producing more research than many other Indian higher educational institutions.“But the best research universities in the world have been able to break out of a chain of undergraduate teaching and become creators of knowledge, in turn attracting the best brains to join them,” the minister said. “And we need that from the IITs if we are to catch up with the West in terms of research,” he added.IIT's surprise convocation package India's moon manShounak Ghosal, TNN 9 August 2009, 03:51am ISTIt wasn't on the invitation card (no reporter claimed to know this), but Isro chief G Madhavan Nair dropped in to collect the institute's highest honour, Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa).\"I'm honoured,\" Nair said, while the applause at the mere mention of Chandrayaan said it all. The Isro chief invited IIT grads and Gen-Y with open arms: \"If you aren't afraid of hard work and have vision, Isro is the place for you.\" Presiding over the occasion where 1862 students received their degrees Tata Steel MD B Muthuraman, who's also the chairman of IIT-Kgp's board of governors, stressed on the long-term benefits of living within one's means. \"You must be a part of a new, evolving India,\" he advised the fresh IIT alumni.For executive director of Tata Sons, R Gopalakrishnan, it was a homecoming of sorts. \"I'm a father, a son and a brother here depending on whom I'm talking to. I was here 45 years ago. It's tough to be an IITian, tougher to an IIT alumnus, and toughest to be the chief guest,\" he said to loud cheers.IIT director Damodar Acharya opened up with a range of expansion plans and long-term goals. \"We are aiming for 11,000 students by 2011. If the government permits, we intend to eventually take in 20,000 students. This year, we had 228 PhD students, which is a record of sorts. As of now, we have about 15% PhD students. We aim to make it at least double,\" the director said."},

I wish students/people take convocation speeches more seriously than appropriate sound bytes that are appropriate to the occassion. I had a chat session yesterday afternoon with few outgoing students (Bibh..., Anim...., Pawa...)  who gathered here for convocation (being held today at IITkgp). They are on their way to do PhD in US universities and asked for suggestions, issues related to research. Then like all previous batches of students, I urged them to come back to India and participate in the nation building process. The discussion invariably led to value based education, peer pressure in making decision, leading life in others terms etc. They wished to be made aware of these when they entered IIT. I am happy that Vivekananda Study Circle (http://vsc.iitkgp.googlepages.com) is organizing a meet on 10th Aug. at S. N. Bose Auditorium as the new session begins. Students like Tapo..., Sum.. are taking lead there. Wish them all the success.Now the DNA article :'IITians should look beyond short-term gains'Mumbai: \"Should we not educate and warn engineers and scientists coming out of IIT Bombay that professional ethics and values should not be compromised for short-term business advantage?\"This was the question put forth by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation managing director E Shreedharan at the institute's 47th Convocation. He suggested that IIT Bombay should incorporate ethics and national values as part of the students' training.\"I am making this suggestion based on my long professional experience, particularly in the context of the tragic accident that took place in Delhi Metro on July 12th when a cantilever pier under load collapsed causing death of seven workers and injuring 16,\" said Shreedharan. He said that a high-level committee concluded that the collapse was due to serious design deficiency.\"The structure was designed by a well-known structural consultancy company and was being constructed by one of the best known civil contractors of India. The design of a cantilever pier is not a complex exercise. It was lack of professional ethics that led to the deficient design,\" he said.Shreedharan told the students that achievements could not be sustainable unless they are built on ethics and values. He further urged students to give back to the country.\"The country invests Rs20 lakh yearly on each student graduating out of this institute. It's your duty to pay back to the nation at least 10 times what you've got from IIT Bombay,\" he said."},

The more interesting is the debate in the comment section. It can be found in http://212.58.226.17/2/hi/south_asia/4793311.stmThe observations of few are given below. It is time to introspect.I am an Italian American executive recruiter, working for technology companies in the west part of the United States. As a part of my job, I have met quite a good number of Indian software professionals from IITs. Most of them are quite successful, established and holding c-level positions in big/blue-chip companies. However, none of these people has ever made any contribution to his/her IIT institute endowment. Surprisingly, some of these people actually made contributions to their graduate schools, such as Caltech, Stanford or CMU. On the other hand, I have seen Chinese people making significant contributions to their institutes in the mainland. I have seen same trends here in the US too. For most of Ivys, these endowments are the major source of funds to attract right talents. Sometimes I wonder - do these people really hate their Indian institutes or ashamed of being Indian? Again, I am not an Indian and this is just my personal opinion. So, no flame please.Bob Copliano, USIf Government institutions cannot attract good researchers, then private research institutions should start doing this. Why are there are not good private universities in India? Lets not forget that schools like Cornell, MIT, Stanford are private schools.Sathyan Subbiah, USA/IndiaThere is a curious straitjacket in the Indian education system- that good students study engineering and medicine and mediocre students study commerce. Therefore, the cream of the students is forced to study mechanical subjects with little emphasis on original research. Few have the patience to study classical sciences, since all are after quick money. The poorest of the students are forced to study humanities and social sciences, and it is fruitless to expect them to come up with cutting-edge research. No wonder most of the top Indian academics, including Kaushik Basu, are based overseas.Aruni Mukherjee, IndiaI am a final year student at IIT Kharagpur . The reasons about the declining number of students who are pursuing research after under graduation can be attributed to the following factors: 1) A job in India for IITians could easily fetch a starting salary of 400,000 rupees plus . However , If one opts to work as a research assistant , or go for PhD , then the stipend one gets is very less . It's like 10,000 rupees per month , whereas if a student goes to US to pursue higher education(read MS/PhD) , he gets $1800 in hand (after taxes) per month . 2) Dearth of quality professors in India . I think the reason for this is the low salary for the professors . At 25,000 rupees ($600) per month , one cant lead a life anywhere near to the kind of lifestyle a highly qualified and brilliant person would like to have . These people would better go abroad and join the US universities , where they get a much better deal. 3) Lack of proper infrastructure: Despite the fact that IITs have produced some great minds , the fact remains that it has to do with the tough entrance procedure . The faculty and infrastructure inside is quite modest by any international standards . There's shortage of water , lavatories stink , mess food is a mess altogether and surroundings are not much hygienic . Why would one like to stay if in every regard the option of doing MS from USA seems a more viable and better option?Pushkar Prasad, India"},

The green shoots of recovery are showing up on satellite images of regions including the Sahel , a semi-desert zone bordering Sahara that stretches 2,400 miles.The study suggests huge increases in vegetation in areas including central Chad and western Sudan. The transition may be occurring because hotter air has more capacity to hold moisture, which creates more rain, said Martin Claussen of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, in Hamburg , Germany. The waterholding capacity of the air is the main driving force, Claussen said.While satellite images cant distinguish temporary plants like grasses that come and go with the rains, ground surveys suggest recent vegetation change is firmly rooted. Throughout North Africa, new trees, such as acacias, are flourishing , according to Stefan Kropelin , a climate scientist at the University of Colognes Africa Research Unit in Germany. ANI"},
{"title": "God and Biometric Identification", "date": "Sunday, July 26, 2009", "text": "The following report published today by Times News Network makes interesting reading. On one hand, it shows people's desperation, taking 'cheating' as a means of 'pleasing' God - funnily enough! On the other hand, one can dig deeper and ask - why do they do what they do? I saw a documentary where dacoits donate 10 percent of their robbery to a temple as the share of the God. I can share my personal experience in visiting Tirumala. The first occassion was way back in 1984 with my parents and it went smoothly, moving from one waiting hall to the next - took about 5-6 hours. The next visit was in 1998 when my elder sister was being treated at Vellore. We were attending her and got a day's off. We reached Tirumala early morning. Even for the special 'darshan' which is priced at a medium level we got a time to enter only at 9 p.m. and the waiting time after entering was estimated as 5-6 hours. For free 'darshan' it is more than a day. We had to return that evening and thus couldn't have darshan. We spent the entire day there and offered prayer from outside. Till today we feel bad, dejected about it. Imagine, somebody coming from far off places from North or North-East taking all the hardship and he/she has a train reservation to return next day - how much frustrated will that person be, all that one gets is a few second darshan of the Lord Venkatesh with people constantly pushing from behind. And a tout surfaces and offers a solution which  is anything but cheating but gurantees darshan within a finite time! In those hours of dejection, frustration - no wonder one may feel tempted! While we take note of 'cheating', we should not lose sight of the longing.I am not trying to justify anything. There is no need either. I am only trying to analyse. As the proverb goes - Errors like straws upon the surface flow/Those who are in search of truth must dive below.Now the article:Hire a child for quick darshan at TirupatiAtop Tirumala Hills, Touts Rent Out Kids For Rs 200TIMES NEWS NETWORK Tirumala: Are you a couple with no kids and still want to have a Mahadwaram darshan of Lord Venkateswara — a quick visit meant for couples with children? No problem. There are touts offering kids on hire.   The charge is Rs 200 per hour for an infant and if the demand is more, the rate goes up to Rs 500. A flourishing “infant on hire” racket atop the Tirumala Hills, kids are rented out for couples to gain an easy entry into the temple.   Talking to TOI, N Vijaya Lakshmi of Nanganallur in Tamil Nadu said: “My friend who got married recently tried her best to get darshan tickets. When her attempts failed, she and her husband paid Rs 250 to a broker, hired an infant and finished their darshan in two hours flat.”   Sources said an infant is rented out three to four times a day and the touts pocket a cool sum by the end of the day. “During peak hours and festive days, we repeat the infant six times,” a tout said.   Temple sources said not less than 2,000 couples and 10,000 physically handicapped pilgrims, who are also given the Mahadwaram privilege, have darshan of the lord every day. The Mahadwaram entry for mothers carrying small kids was introduced by the TTD in May 2007 to ensure darshan in a couple of hours and avoid long queues. After protests from women that their husbands should also be given direct entry, the TTD board allowed them from July 1.   On the thriving infant racket, a former temple official said TTD officials should issue onspot photographs of the family to check whether they have children and then allow darshan. When contacted, top TTD officials said they are introducing biometric and finger-ink systems to keep tabs on the misuse of the Mahadwaram entry by couples.   But experts feel the system would not help. “The reason: fine rays and rings on the palm are not fully developed in infants who are less than a year old. If the TTD opts for the ink system, it can be easily erased using nailpolish remover,” an expert said."},

Slowly, people have started accepting that for many diseases, it is better than taking medicines. There were some reports (e.g. Baba Ramdev's camp, one in US being detected cancer was given six months lifetime and after fun-filled six months he finds that he is cured) that even the dreaded of all diseases cancer can be cured which is not possible by any human made medicine. That perhaps hurt our ego like anything. Now, it is heartening to note the following development coming from an India born scholar. We may find around us two distinct type of things - man made and nature/God(give it any name) made. While we may show greater amount of confidence on man made things (though side effects are known much later which often has proven to be counter productive), we can be humble in explaining other things - to say that we understand only this much as on today. Exploration, evidence collection and drawing inferences is a long process and till that time it is unscientific to reject any hypothesis that comes from someone's experience. Outliers need not be noise. In fact, it can provide vital clue in our attempt to explain the unexplained. From Times News Network : July 25, 2009Body secretes its own cancer-busting proteinKounteya Sinha | TNN New Delhi: Last year, he hit the headlines for creating the world’s first breed of super mice, which are resistant to all forms of cancer. Now, Mumbai-born and US-settled Dr Vivek Rangnekar, professor of radiation medicine at the University of Kentucky, has in another breakthrough discovered that the Par-4 protein (a mass killer of cancer cells) is produced within the human body itself and spreads through circulation to distant organs.  This finding will now help scientists look at ways to naturally increase the secretion of the protein, for example, by certain natural diets and develop resistance to the growth of cancer.  Scientists can also develop approaches to safely inject the Par-4 protein to inhibit cancer.  The team headed by Dr Rangnekar has also found that the Par-4 protein is capable of killing cancer cells, when applied from outside. Till this discovery, scientists believed that Par-4 protein has to be present inside cancer cells to kill them.  Since it isn’t easy to deliver large amounts of the protein inside cancer cells, scientists have been studying other methods to target and kill cancer cells.   Par-4, after being secreted by human tissues, has also been found to kill only cancer cells. It didn’t harm normal cells, proving they aren't toxic. The presence of large amounts of the Par-4 protein in the super mice had made them completely immune to cancer. Not only did they not develop tumours, they even lived longer.  According to Dr Rangnekar, who is associate director of the University of Kentucky’s Markey Cancer Center, what these findings mean for the future is that it may not be necessary to use invasive or genetic approaches to inhibit the growth of cancer."},

{"title": "A Feedback", "date": "Friday, July 17, 2009", "text": "Picked up the following thread from http://forums.bharat-rakshak.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3951&p=700430 An IIT Madras alumnus writes his side of the story and few suggestions. Simply admirable.This is by no means a report of criticism, but one with a goal of providing honest feedback to the authorities concerned towards the goal of making OUR ALMA-MATER even better than the state it was in, when we left it. Nor, is it a rebuke to the department of Electrical Engineering, as almost all of these ills abound every department that we have come across, by talking to friends and hostel-mates in these departments. Moreover, a few of us, with the hunger to pursue fundamental research have chosen not to return (at least not now) to guide our alma-mater towards this goal. The reasons for this are manifold. We elucidate some of the issues on this sensitive topic and short and long term solutions for a few issues, with an adaptability to correct our stated positions, if addressed in a ratiocinative way. We start with the most important issue,1) Quality of students: While it is well accepted that the JEE has brought in extremely good quality undergraduate students, the same cannot be said of GATE. Exceptions to this rule do happen once in a while, but unless there are good quality students pursuing fundamental research, no amount of intellectual coaxing from the faculty can lead a mediocre student to greatness. With the current software/MBA boom, it is highly unlikely that most graduating undergraduate students will stay back, unless they like what they are doing and do not feel short-changed in the process. Towards this one has to increase the (to be continued after the Update …)Update since the last editing: It is now patently clear that even the “standards” of JEE are slipping with qualified students acting as force-multipliers of the Kota-business model. Thus it is imperative on the part of the JEE admissions committee to diversify their selection criteria from a rote regurgitation of facts and “concepts” that would make a B.Sc. graduate feel dumb to that of indirectly deducing the long-term potentials of a student. A good mix of students who would continue to pursue Engineering, or pursue fundamental research in Engineering and Sciences, would become managers in the Technology industry, or would enter administrative positions such as the IAS is ideal for any Tier-1 University. Unfortunately, the JEE has thrown candidates who are skewed at one end of the spectrum. 2) (contd) Financial benefits for students pursuing research: The financial benefits that IITs offer (around Rs. 10,000 per month) maybe sufficient for making the ends of single students meet, but for students with a family to support, it may be too much of a financial stress. A compromise that some students seek is a “technical industrial position” that pays at a reasonably comfortable level. It may be assumed that students with ‘drive’ will indeed get back to do a Ph.D. once their financial situations permit it. The hard reality of life however is that forces such as marriage, family, settled life etc. would dissuade most students who postpone a Ph.D. from enrolling in the same at a later stage. All this forcefully extols the virtues of “going with the flow.” Short term Solution: Establishment of alumni funds to reward students pursuing Ph.D. on par with current industry salaries. Establishment of fellowships/scholarships with a great financial incentive and renewals (of the scholarships) based on the students’ progress. Long term Solution: Alumni funds and active involvement of GoI and state governments in promoting fundamental research in the basic and engineering sciences. 3) Grants: Given that technological advancement and fundamental research in India is still on the backburner (due to the lack of primary literacy and affordability of a square meal for a significant percentage of the population), absence of agencies similar to the NSF, DARPA, ONR etc. is one of fundamental concern to prospective faculty members. A comparison of DARPA with our very own DRDO is unfair, as the freedom to perform research within a broad framework (that is implicit at NSF/DARPA) is usually absent and is more guided by problem-fixing in funded/existing projects. Even assuming significant grants for fundamental research (like in Europe) it would take at least a few decades to catch up with the US. An absence of such a possibility only lengthens the time-span between now and the day we catch up with the US and other European countries. Long term Solution: Alumni funds can only go a particular distance in catching up. However in the absence of a policy change at the GoI level (which is likely to be the case for a long while given the GoI’s responsibilities at the primary education level), alumni funds is probably the only way to offset this shortfall. And alumni will not donate their hard-earned income unless they are made to feel a part of the decision-making process. The IIT administration has to trade off its autonomy with the amount of feedback and participation received from the alumni. Update: Alumni funding has not caught up to the level expected. However, to be fair to GoI and alumni, the primary cause for woe is actually the lack of a significant number of qualified students pursuing Ph.D. that could fully utilize what the GoI has sanctioned. 4) Emoluments for an academic position: While some applicants looking for an academic position would consider emoluments to be a secondary or even a tertiary issue, the fact that academic positions pay less than what an MBA or an MS/Ph.D. can earn in the industry would certainly dissuade a good fraction of the candidates from pursuing the academic route. It is hard to ascertain what percentage of possible candidates would change their mind if better salaries are made available, but it would be great in the long run if academic positions are monetarily as attractive as industrial positions for it would encourage competition among the population that could shift either way. Long term Solution: Establishment of sponsored chairs and professorships, industry sponsored positions, alumni sponsored positions etc. Tenureships and higher wages on the line of American universities could help in competition and benefit the institution as a whole. The possibility of the faculty paying themselves from their grants (like in the US) upto a certain limit and upon independent verification by a body within the IIT. Update: The GoI set-up Sixth Pay Commission re-evaluation exercise seems to have come in as a temporary “boon” to those who are employed at the IITs. While the positives have been stated, the negative has been that the pay commission’s recommendation has not been implemented for a small sub-set of the GoI employees, including the faculty, staff and research students of the IITs. Needless to say, most of the states have also proportionately increased the pay of their state government employees leaving the IIT faculty in a unique, but weird position. If the education sector, which is the backbone of any country’s progress, is treated so step-motherly when compared with other sectors such as the Railways, Administration etc., and even if unavoidable delays such as the IIT Act are cited, we are in for a shaky ride. 5) Library resources: The Central library at IITM is probably the best “technical” library in Madras from our experience as undergraduates. However, comparisons even with a low/medium ranked US university would be agonizing. The reasons for these include: the large number of journals published in Electrical engineering alone, the cost of most of these journals (USD/Euro pricing), and students’ tardiness and impatience which leads them to tearing off scripts that they deem as more important to them than the general population. The state of special topic books is even more painful to describe. Long term Solution: Pooling the library funds/facilities of the IITs/IISc/other top level universities and setting up a nationwide electronic database of “absolutely necessary” journals. Re-bargaining with European/US publishers for financial incentives citing the sheer size of the Indian market addressed by such a database is a must. This re-bargaining must include copyright issues, rights to older issues when electronic journals were not in vogue, the need for pricing the goods at the purchasing power of the market etc. GoI involvement is a must to ensure that lobbying gets done and make sure that this business deal does not fall through. Inter-library loan agreements with universities in the US/Europe/Oceania/Japan/South Korea/anywhere else can lead to faster access times for manuscripts and obscure books. Development of alumni funds for shipping “book loans,” that cannot be electronically transmitted, to and from the foreign country, in case of extremely speedy requirements of certain obscure books. While the long term solution will get rid of the problem of students’ tearing off scripts, a short term remedy for this is the presence of dummy/non-dummy closed-circuit cameras, development of an honor code and strict punishments to offenders. 6) Teaching loads – Mini Sabbaticals: While some academicians do and most claim to love teaching, it is a well-known fact that most of them clamor for lesser teaching loads in lieu of pursuing their research interests. Exceptionally great research performance/contributions (like award winning papers in international journals, special issue publications, accolades like nomination as IEEE Fellows etc. or any other suitable justification) can be rewarded by lifting the teaching burdens for those who request it (for a semester and upto a year). Such temporary “accolades” could be cancelled for that semester (or year) if no faculty member in a department has made “significant” contributions worthy of such accolades. Not only would a semester or two of zero teaching load reductions be annoying to any proud faculty member, but such limited positions would also ensure that there is a positive competitive atmosphere among the junior and senior faculty, thus advancing the department as a whole. Even if the department would be a few faculty members too short to teach the basic/advanced courses, the research benefits accrued by such a scheme would more than offset the negative effects. Besides, people who fare badly in research can be made to share more than their normal share of courses, thus discouraging poor research performance. Appointing non tenure-track teaching faculty/lecturers (with a Ph.D. or M.S. + teaching training) and temporary positions can also aid in sharing the teaching burden. First year engineering courses can be taught by well-trained teaching assistants who are either graduate or exceptional senior undergraduate students. This will also aid in rounding off the development potential of the student population. Some financial/logistical investment may be necessary to train/reward/pay the teaching assistants. Update: After I talked with some senior colleagues of mine with this half-baked idea, I was castigated roundly for its obvious hare-brainedness. The logic is as follows: The responsibility of a faculty member is to teach and research. It is not one of the two, but both. Teaching sabbaticals are known in the US as “buy-outs.” While buy-outs happen often enough in the US, it is a practice that breeds academic jealousies. Further, if there is a reward mechanism, someone will get the award irrespective of their absolutist credentials. Even if a mini-sabbatical is offered as a reprieve mechanism to improve the performance of the department, the prospects that it will create distrust, breed nepotism, burden the administrators with an unenviable exercise etc. are huge. The emotional maturity of Ph.D. students to teach a course is also questionable, more so in the case of India. Above all, the most important issue I encountered was: “Undergraduate students do not pay their tuition fees to get taught by intermediates such as Teaching Assistants or Teaching Fellows.” At the end of the day, teaching load for a faculty member is not really that huge except the first time (or the first few times) a syllabus and course materials are prepared, so foregoing continued teaching in the guise of re-apportioning resources for research is a cop-out of the highest order. In the light of this criticism, I will retain this half-baked idea under the heading of a personally motivated half-baked idea. 7) Faculty collaboration: First-rate research usually never gets done single-handedly. Presence of a large pool of talented faculty to brainstorm and lead research in multi-farious directions is the key to a department’s renown in the international community. Besides, it is more likely that brainstorming with a group that has expertise in different, but slightly related, backgrounds can lead to inspired and complementary methods of attack for complex problems. While this is not meant to berate the quality of current faculty at IITM, it would be significantly attractive to work in a place with people who are well-known in their fields. Moreover, an assemblage of experts in different fields is a blessing in disguise for the students who can run into them with their fundamental questions. On a side note, such an assemblage in turn would motivate the best students to do their Ph.D. at IITM and not run away to American universities/software industry. 8 ) Interactions with industry: While interactions with the industry have to be encouraged, they cannot be a substitute for publishing and performing fundamental research. There is a significant difference between fundamental research which is path-breaking and sets trends for the future and “sustenance research” which meets the needs of today. A lot of importance was (and still is), at least in Electrical Engineering, accorded to implementing things in coordination/collaboration/conjunction with the industry. In the process, IITM lost (loses) out on two things: One, new avenues/directions of research just when the engineering sciences are in the cusp of a major revolution, and Two, a paradigm shift and a strategic meltdown in the priorities of the institute.Anecdote: As undergraduate students, we had seen first-hand the focus that was placed on “getting our hands dirty and making things work.” Such a skill is fundamental and essential to surviving the real world we were to have entered upon graduation. But primary focus in B.tech projects on making things work, killed the analytical skills of some of us beyond repair. We would not be making far-fetched comments in stating that such projects totally demotivated a few students who had hard-to-match analytical capabilities. The lack of vision, knowledge of our capacities, the sheer logistics of assigning 90 students B.tech projects and the indifference of the department administration in assigning a “one-glove fits all” project assignments could have been easily overcome by drawing simple correlations from our grades in some of the core courses and our capabilities. (For example, Communications students who tend to do well in theory/Math courses could have been assigned theoretical problems, those doing well in networking/programming related courses could have been assigned networking projects, those doing well in device physics/quantum physics courses could have been assigned hardcore projects in device modeling etc.) Such indifference has also been seen in other departments. While some credit must go to the communications group to ensure that the WLL scheme is well-known in India, in the context of research health of IITM and the department of Electrical Engineering, this has been possible only by trading-off sustenance and utilitarian research with fundamental research. I am personally of the opinion that IITs should not take the responsibility that firmly belongs with GoI. 9) Indifference of undergraduate students: This issue is of tremendous importance given the falling attendance in many undergraduate courses today. The truth is that a few students do go on the “cruise mode” once they have cleared the JEE and entered the prestigious IITs, but a vast majority of them are turned off because they are not sufficiently “intellectually challenged.” I recall my undergraduate advisor telling me, both directly and indirectly, in the course of my B.tech project: “Please prove your analytical talent, if you have any.” Such a challenge not only ensured that I did justice to what my capabilities were, but also furthered me in loving doing research. Long term Solution: The “one glove fits all” attitude of curriculum development at IITM is the fundamental issue at the heart of this problem. While this may offer a logistically simple solution to the administrators, such an attitude destroys students’ enthusiasm in research, making them wander around the pristine campus, unaware of what they can do (academically) and cruise along by doing the bare minimum necessary for graduation. In most of the American universities, an outline of fields in which a particular number of credits have to be mandatorily taken is prescribed, but never the courses themselves. There is the freedom to choose the courses one would like to pursue. Such a freedom was (and even today is - except for the final year curriculum, the time by which the rot has already set in) absent in many inter-disciplinary courses that we had to take, like Fluid Mechanics, Material Sciences for Electrical Engineers, Chemistry 101/102 etc. While these courses may have been important for a particular branch of Electrical Engineering (like Device Physics), such an overview can be obtained by students interested in Communication Systems by taking a single course. An all-around development of the individual is necessary, but not to the point of indifference. If a communications student had the choice to pursue advanced courses in Mathematics, many indeed would have. Update: Things seem to have been streamlined far better today with curriculum revision. The number of credits an undergraduate student “has to” take for a B.tech degree is far less than that necessary when we were students. It is, however, not clear to me as to what alternatives have been proposed to fill the gap. Unless such credible opportunities exist, little long-term direct benefits can be expected. 10) Relationship between professors and students – The Generation Gap: While the fact remains that every professor wants his/her students to succeed, the divergent paths adopted by them is not only a symbol of their uniqueness and their academic and intellectual freedom, but also a potential source for unintended consequences. In this context, given that there are at least 90 students in an EE class, the possibilities that a professor knows every student by name or background is particularly remote. Moreover, given that the professors are at least 5-10 years older than the general student population, what was necessarily the right approach in the past does not necessarily have to be perceived by the student populace to be the right approach. When the professors tend to set themselves as the “Never committing an error, morally or intellectually” example (at least in front of the class), even a small double standard can be blown out of proportion. While a few students would remain inactive and be an “intellectual drain” on the resources, despite providing them the “best” research topics, generalizing this to every student in the class (the most probable reason for our predicament of uninterested and indifferent faculty) seems to have been a bit insensitive to our goals and aspirations and more so, our logical reasoning capabilities. Long term Solution: To be fair, I must add that a few of our professors, did advise us and help us to the best of their abilities. But it remains that the wide gulf between the students and the professors only seems to be widening to this day and not being engulfed. A refrain from most of us is: We never got to know any of the professors except for their teaching. Even professors who are perceived to be bad teachers by the students would have been “forgiven,” if they had showed an “explicit” and genuine interest in our well-being. While not every one of us would have been enthusiastic about a tea party with the professors, those who would have been could have convinced our hostel/branch-mates that “they are not as bad as they seem.” It is the imperative of the professors to be mature enough to not impose their “time-tested, right” way of doing things on the students. In this setting, it would be worthwhile to note that most students are in their teenage years, well-known for its rebellious attitude. Sermonizing was the last thing we wanted, but we would have sapped up any advice, provided it came for free without having to sacrifice our freedoms in making “informed” decisions. Other issues of concern include11) Financial aid in attending international conferences – a necessary requirement to be known by the research community. This is still a GIANT problem, and perhaps the BIGGEST problem faced by faculty at the IITs. 12) Bureaucracy in getting paperwork through (especially at the Ad-Block)13) Official apathy to perceived injustices/Corruption – What is right is not always perceived by the student population to be right. Thus speedy decisions not only have to be made, but also sold well to the student community. An example would be the case of Internet ban (in the hostel zone), if such a decision were to be taken today. Given that Internet in the hostels is not a necessary condition for success, and is responsible for many unforeseen issues that lead to estrangement from the system at large, it would be easy to ban it today, but hard to sell it. Conclusion: Despite the lure of family, friends, low cost of living, living where your heart is, cultural moorings, nationalistic ideals, and many other reasons, most undergraduate students from IITM who are now on the brink of an academic career at the US do not tend to return because of the “ills” that are elucidated above. It is highly timely that at least a few of these ills are fixed, if there is any hope that some of them will return in the immediate future. At a crucial point in time, when administrators of government bodies are seriously pursuing the renaming of existing universities to IITs, which would further dilute the already diluted brand that is IIT, it would be imperative on them to consider the question: “Why not fix the leaking house that exists, instead of building new ones or increasing the pool of leaky houses?” Update: Since this personal recollection was written five years back, the GoI has gone full-steam ahead with renaming of existing institutions as IITs and starting new IITs. Going into the reasons behind GoI’s decision will divert us from the focus here. But unfortunately, it remains a fact that many of the new IITs are running (or planning to run) from creeky old-infrastructure, and more importantly, hiring for these new IITs seems to be a big problem. But the problems that non-metro (but established) IITs such as those at Guwahati, Kanpur and Kharagpur face today is a more serious issue especially with the expected retirement of old faculty members or return of “borrowed” faculty members. Hiring new faculty members for these non-metro IITs is becoming a big problem as returnees from the US and elsewhere find it a non-attractive option for family reasons. Other problems such as international travel grants for students and faculty, a short-fall in quality Ph.D. candidates, adequate compensation packages etc. only add to the mess. The steep demands and challenges by the GoI to the IITs and IISc to “produce” at least 1000 Ph.Ds per annum without a proportionate increase in infrastructure and fixing of the fundamental ills listed above is certainly a cause for concern. Nevertheless, the progress that some of the IITs (and the education sector, in general) have made makes this author optimistic that the “elephant may amble, but it will get to its intended destination.” The global economic downturn only makes his optimism grow, and in that sense, the best service the west could do for India in a long time is to sustain the downturn in their economies."},

{"title": "Layoff", "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2009", "text": "Copyright 2000-2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. All rights reserved.    Provided by BusinessWeek : From ET web edition, 28.5.2009Dear John,  While this could easily be a private letter between you and me, current economics are hinting to me that perhaps my condition is wider-spread than just my house. As a result, I've elected to make this a public letter. I hope you don't mind.  I'm writing today to thank you for my layoff. When you hired me to work in your firm two years ago, we both knew we were taking a chance on each other. Thank you for treating me well. Thanks for the raises, the benefits and the annual company picnic. I thank you and my family thanks you. I will cherish the knowledge and friendships that built during my time with the company, but most of all, I'm thankful for my layoff.  In these days of extreme economic hardship, you should know that I haven't gone crazy since we last spoke. In fact, I think I may have gone sane. All joking aside, this layoff may be one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Let me explain.  I did what every good pink-slip recipient should do. I spruced up my resume and filed for unemployment. I even bought a paper to search jobs in the classifieds. However, it seems that unless you're looking for a used dishwasher or a '93 Civic, there isn't much in the ads these days. Still, required by the local unemployment office, I had to try to get three jobs a week. I found myself scouring for jobs that I knew I would hate. I gave up. After one week, I stopped claiming unemployment. (And if the state of Washington wants its $453 back, they can have it).  You see, the pre-Christmas layoff timing was perfect. It saved me a fortune on child care and the kids will forever remember it as the year we spent three days building the best gingerbread house ever. (It looked just like Snoopy's doghouse.)  We thought this layoff would be a crushing financial blow and opted to hand-make all of our Christmas gifts. They were a huge hit with our family and friends and we spent several wonderful days together as a family creating them. We didn't at all miss the experience of circling the mall for hours looking for a parking spot. The kids didn't sit on Santa's lap at Macy's but we did run into him at a neighborhood ice hockey game and snapped a photo. I'll mail you one. John, while severance would have been really nice, the gift that you gave me was an abundance of quiet, contemplative time to decide what to do with my life. Not a career, not my time, but my life. I hired a career coach (a tax-deductible job search expense, I thought to myself). I started a workout routine, and I wrote my day-to-day experiences down for myself as a way to order my thoughts. I had ambition. A special breed of ambition that comes from wondering how I'll pay that career coach, or for that matter, even pay my next student loan bill. We wrote out our household budget for the first time ever, and we stuck to it. I wrote a business plan to start my business, and my husband encouraged me to restart the freelance writing career that I'd put on hold six years ago when I got married. Now I work only part-time for myself and I write part time. I never commute. My wonderful kids are thriving. And as for that student loan payment I wasn't sure I could make in December? I paid the balance of the loan off in full in February, three years ahead of schedule.  With the time afforded to me by my layoff, I was able to focus on my family and household. We kept waiting for the loss of income to hit us with that anticipated financial blow, but it didn't come. I started a blog to inspire others to living \"laid off\" and making do without a \"real job\" through smarter spending and finding efficiencies.  Throughout my career, I'd never taken the time to live. I'd never shopped for banks or health insurance. I'd never second-guessed my 401k and never taken the time to design a budget for the family. I'd never volunteered in the kids' classrooms or created a plan more than six months in duration because things might have changed at work.  With no last-minute time crunches at the office, my kids don't think that food comes from a box in the freezer. We cook food that looks like the way it naturally grew. I have more peace of mind than I can ever remember. I'm reading books for fun; I'm indulging in hobbies and spending time with friends and family. I've reconnected with old friends and I volunteer with causes that are important to me.  This is the most rewarding period of my life, ever.  Just wanted to let you know, in case you're wondering, I'm OK. And thank you again for all you taught me. Most of all, for my layoff. I'm living my dream, and it's all thanks to you, I might never have found with it means to live otherwise.  Sincerely,  Jessica Ward"},
{"title": "Something Special", "date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2009", "text": "Life also throws up sweet surprises! And often it comes as an education. We educators at IITkgp take pride in working round the clock, often more than 16 hours a day, even being a Government servant!So it was an eye opener for me to work as a trainer cum coordinator of a short term course involving seven very special people. Their enthusiasm and energy, eagerness to learn were something I have never seen in more than ten short term courses I have participated so far and almost a half of them as a coordinator.One example may elucidate my point. Like any other day they were there in the class room five minute ahead of time. After a grueling 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. work out that involved 6 theory classes and 1 lab. session they reached their hostel at about 5:45 p.m. Soon after, I received a set of new books on audio, video processing which we wanted to gift them. At about 6:30 p.m. I knocked the door of the senior most person of the group in the hostel with those books. What did I see? He is reading and taking notes from two books which we had given earlier. And the person had been very humble about this.The point that a good number of participants having backgrounds other than engineering remained glued to the course for six consecutive days with no signal of fatigue was something extra ordinary.At the end, I must say that it had been a very unique, endearing and educative experience for me. My special thanks and sincere regards to these special people.P.S. : I know that many posts are due from me whether it is Goa Workshop, Industry Academic Meet at Kolkata or NSS meet with the children. It is end sem time along with deadlines for book proof checking, sponsored projects, technology licensing etc. etc. I'll be more regular when I get some breathing space."},
{"title": "Being Heard", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2009", "text": "Tuesday's in this semester had been the busiest. The two hour lecture in the forenoon session is followed by a three hour lab. in afternoon session. The Vivekananda study circle begins at 7 p.m. In between, we have meeting of neuro-signal processing groups on alternate week. The day ends with rushing back to home from study circle at about 8:15 p.m. and teaching my daughter for an hour or so.However, this Tuesday morning I had two interesting student visitors in my office once the double lectures were over. They were two 2nd year students from the Dept. of Industrial Engineering & Management. Intially I thought that they are following up business plan development activity, one management school head asked me to help sometime back.It was a sweet surprise when they told that they wanted to meet me for a reason-other than professional. They wanted to inform me one intiative they (a team of 10 students) are launching inspired by the activities of Mr. Anshu Gupta, an Ashoka fellow and a journalist. His aim is to channelize 'vital resources lying in excess in urban and middle-class household to far flung areas of rural India' i.e. one person's rag can be another person's riches. The organization he has lunched is named 'Goonj .. a voice an effort' and now has 300 volunteers across 20 states. It was awarded 'Indian NGO of the year' for its governance and practices. (source http://www.goonj.info)It was nice to know about Goonj and the students' willingness to be a part of this effort. On operational issues the students said that for next three Sundays (till end-sem exam.) they would be holding camps in different halls to collect disposable garments. Goonj has some process of converting them to useful products like sanitray napkins etc. for distribution among rural masses. Post end-sem exam. they would sort the collection, pack them and send to one collection centre of Goonj.I asked them to think about what the team members would do rest of the year. Garment collection can be done once a year or twice a year. Also, there are at least three other organizations who approached the campus community in 2008 for collection of old garments - twice for flood relief victims and once for distribution among the local poors in the neighbourhood of IITkgp campus. The previous collection drives must not have reached each of the 10000 strong campus community members and thus there is lot of scope but the expectation can be modest and the effort required, would be higher.I also made them aware of some age old adage on new initiative like this -  they may face ridicule, opposition and even then if they stick to it the acceptance might come. People may doubt their intention - whether it is to add some brownie point in their resume, siphoning off funds collected etc. etc. It is not that such things do not happen in the name of NGO activity. Also one may ask that there are at least 5-6 other NGO arms operating in IITkgp campus - why another one?The more than an hour interaction ended with a very positive note. I told them that I am  interested to know how this effort benefits the less privileged section of the society. However, I shall be more interested to know what effect engagements like these brings unto the team members. The ten of them at present, probably more to join - how they prepare themeselves to respond to the need of the nation that makes every act of us a service, not just one effort here, another effort there and that dissolves the invisible boundary of our selfish and unselfish selves.It was great to know about this new initiative of the young IITians. As we have many religions, sects, catering to the needs of people of different background - we can have many such intiatives catering to the aspiration of young population. Let the 'Goonj' be heard in IITkgp campus. Go ahead, dear students. Our best wishes..."},

It is based on interviews with 1,203 Indian and Chinese professionals who had worked or studied in the US but returned home.We found that the vast majority of the returnees were in their 30's and 90% held masters or PhDs in management, technology or science. They were at the very top of the educational distribution for these highly educated immigrant groups -- precisely the kind of people that make the greatest contribution to the US economy and job growth.We asked them why they returned and how they have fared since returning. Returnees said they had much better economic and professional opportunities in their home countries and they had advanced significantly in their careers. Respondents saw much better entrepreneurial opportunities back home, and over half of our sample planned to start their own business, if they had not already done so.But it wasn't only about the money or career opportunities. Most were making less money, but believed they had a better quality of life. They found emotional growth and family values to be much better in their home countries. They also confirmed that family considerations were the strongest factors drawing them home.It wasn't just H1-B's and students who were returning. Thirty percent were US permanent residents or citizens. About a third complained about the pollution and bureaucracy back home. Regardless, only a quarter of our sample said they intended return to the US.An analysis of the 2000 census by William R Kerr of Harvard Business School showed that immigrants made up 24% of the US science and engineering workforce holding bachelor's degrees and 47% of science and engineering workers that have PhDs. Yet, immigrants account for only 12% of the US working population.What's more, immigrants made up 67% of all additions to US science and engineering workforce between 1995 to 2006. Kerr found evidence that the presence of more foreign knowledge workers actually had a positive impact on patent filings by US born workers in the same region.Similarly, Jennifer Hunt of McGill University and Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle of Princeton University analysed long-term changes in the US population in a paper published in January 2009 titled 'How Much Does Immigration Boost Innovation?'They calculated that, for every percentage point rise in the share of immigrant college graduates in the US population, the total per capita number of patents for the entire population should increase by 6 percent.Make no mistake. This is a zero-sum game. Immigrants who leave America will launch their companies in other countries, file patents in other countries and fill the intellectual coffers of other countries. Those companies and those patents will benefit countries like India, China and Canada not the United States. America's loss is the world's gain."},

Today TOI reports (appended below) death of a first year medical students who are harassed repeatedly and beaten to death by their third year seniors, all drunk. The poor boy told his parents but the parents sent him back thinking (wishing and praying)  it was a passing phase. I wonder if there will be any survey by saner portion of the student community addressing these1) What percentage of students falter in study, develop psychological problem due to ragging?2) Who are these seniors continuing and abetting the crime? Are they the frustrated lot who are not doing well in study, lacks self-confidence and ragging is the only way to show their 'manliness' or find some value for themselves?3) How much is it related to establishing authority of a section of students so that their fifedom continues along with creation of next line of command (from juniors) to continue the unholy activities?4) How much is it reated to the abetter of the crime not participating in social and cultural activities, sports and games etc.. Are they indulging in such saddistic pleasure by not getting/utilizing an avenue to channelize their energy?5) How much does it come from a sense of revenge but directed to a wrong person - I was humiliated, I cannot humiliate a senior, I'll derive plaesure by humiliating a junior?6) Finally, how many among the so called 'good boys' among the seniors who do not actively participate in ragging but justify it?There is no fun in traumatizing the lives of a fresher and his parents. There is no 'manliness' in showing my 'power' to someone in a disadvantageous position. The 'orientation' can be done in much healthier manner by arranging cultural function, sports etc. and asking them to participate in it. The faculty members can also be included somewhere in the loop, if so required. Let's eradicate this social evil we have inherited. Let the youth of India inculcate healthy habits and unitedly fight against menaces trying to destroy our country, create division, destroy the dream of young achievers. A terrorist attack in Mumbai, killing 200 people unites the whole country.  Why not deaths as reported next, and trauma the young lives go through, the slow poisoning in the name of ragging unite us and let us stand firm against it? Do we ourselves also derive/derived some sort of plesaure out of it? Do we in our work place indulge in similar things to our new collagues, making his/her life as difficult as possible in a new place? Do all the people in an advanatageous position do the same thing to some one who come in their way and in an disadvantageous position? I am trying to generalize it by not singling out the student community and to include me as a faculty member. My greatest hope lies in the younger generation, the youth of this country, the agent of change! You can if you want.It is always easy to point finger at others and fight somebody who comes from outside. It is very difficult to find fault with ourselves and work resolutely to come out of that. But, we have to do that, if we want a young, vibrant India for ourselves and the generations to come (who we should remember shall be studying in these campus that will continue to remain in a sorry state, if we don't act as a student, NOW).HP medical student dies after ragging by seniorsNaresh Kumar Sharma & Anand Bodh | TNN Dharamsala: A Delhi boy who had taken admission in a m e d i c a l school in Himachal Pradesh last year met with a horrible death at the hands of seniors who are training to be doctors.     Aman Kachroo (19), who passed out of DPS International and enrolled at the Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda, in Kangra last August had repeatedly complained to his parents about the brutal ragging on the campus—often by drunk third-year students. On Friday night and Saturday morning, the boy was beaten so badly that he died.     “Aman used to tell us about ragging, but we never thought that it was so serious. The firstyear students had complained to the college, but no steps were taken to stop it. We’ve lost our son, but many others can be saved if timely steps are taken,’’ his aunt Indira Dhar said.     The violence underlines the fact that campuses haven’t moved to ban ragging and treat offenders seriously despite SC warnings and orders. .....   Terming it as an unfortunate incident, Himachal Pradesh health minister Rajiv Bindal said, “Strict action would be initiated against students who were involved in it. Police are looking into the matter and well ensure total transparency in the proceedings. An autopsy was done incamera and in the presence of a lawyer.”"},

The following article of him which appeared in today's TOI is an excellent one. -----------------------You have nothing to fear but fear itselfKishore Biyani     Darr ke aagey jeet hai. Conquer fear and you can conquer anything. I learnt this fairly early while growing up in a joint family along with 13 siblings and cousins.     Every evening, we would gather around our grandmother to hear her stories. One of her favourite stories revolved around five pilgrims who were on a journey to the holy places in the Himalayas. On a bitterly cold night, they arrived at a dharamshala. It had only one room and the gatekeeper warned them against staying there as legend had it that it was inhabited by a big snake. He told them no one had ventured inside for years. On hearing this, the pilgrims decided to play safe and spend the night in the open.     After a few shivering hours, one of them overcame his fear and decided to check the room. On entering, he didn’t find a snake. Instead, a rope lay on the floor. In the dark it resembled a snake. But the other pilgrims didn’t believe the account and decided to sleep outside. The brave one slept soundly; for his fellow travellers it was a long night.     As my grandmother would explain, failure exists only in one’s imagination. We fear failure, because we fear criticism, ridicule or rejection. But the truth is that anyone who has been successful has failed at some stage of their life. From failure comes knowledge of what works and what doesn’t; from failure comes knowledge of one’s strengths and weaknesses and it’s from failure that one begins a more determined attempt to achieve success. As one grows up therecomes the realization that there is no standard measure of failure or success. It is a relative term. What one person perceives as extraordinary success may be an ordinary accomplishment for another. What may seem a failure today often turns out to be insignificant in the long run.     Thankfully, I grew up in an environment where there were no high expectations I would excel academically. I never came first in any school exam. I hardly attended classes at college. That may not be the best thing to do but in retrospect I believe that there are many lessons to learn outside the classroom. Learning about how to build relationships and business partnerships; about human behavior and social dynamics is just as important as classroom lessons to succeed in any field.     It is a fact that in our society we ridicule failure. Rather than encourage people to take the road less travelled, we discourage them. There is encouragement to conform to a set pattern rather than stand out in a crowd. This is why failing an exam or a new venture is feared.     I don’t think setbacks, disappointments, rejections and unsuccessful attempts can be called failures. They are steps to success. How one deals with a setback determines the success of the next step. A sudden setback can be seen as a brick wall. It can also be seen as a stepping stone. It’s the way one perceives it that determines whether an unsuccessful attempt turns into a failure. Absolute failure is about not trying to do new things; it’s about lack of conviction; it’s about giving up."},

Please, go through what 'Paras', 'Ekta', 'Sahayog' - NGOs doing in Surat, the other article in today's TOI.

Finally, Ravishankarji on Valentine Day.13-yr-old fathers child, sparks outrage in UKCritics Say Shocking Case Highlights Social Breakdown Of BritainLondon: A baby-faced 13-yearold schoolboy has fathered a child with his 15-year-old girlfriend, it emerged on Friday, triggering debate about the country’s high level of teenage pregnancies.     Alfie Patten, whose voice has not yet broken, admitted he had not thought about how he and girlfriend Chantelle Steadman would support baby daughter Maisie Roxanne, who was born on Monday, but vowed to be a good father.     “I didn’t think about how we would afford it. I don’t really get pocket money. My dad sometimes gives me £10,” the fourfoot tall teenager from Eastbourne, told the Sun tabloid. “When my mum found out, I thought I was going to get in trouble... I didn’t know what it would be like to be a dad. I will be good, though, and care for it.”     The case has also drawn comment from Prime Minister Gordon Brown, while a former leader of the Conservative Party said it was an example of social breakdown in “broken Britain”. In diamond city, marriage brings sparkle to sex workers’ livesA Volunteer Group In Surat Is Helping Women Shut The Door On ProstitutionYagnesh Mehta | TNN Surat: A wedding is special for every woman but for Sulaxmi, it was more special than most. Ten years after she entered the sex trade in Surat, the 28-year-old was shutting the door on a profession she had been forced into and starting a new life. “It is every woman's dream but an impossible one for a sex worker. Many a man loves us but no one wants to get married,” says Sulaxmi. But the impossible became possible after a voluntary group’s efforts resulted in her marrying a young diamond worker.     Now after more than two years of marriage, Hitesh Patel, who hails from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, says he couldn’t be happier. “I was in a relationship with Sulaxmi but the thought of marriage didn't cross my mind,” he admits. The credit for this important step, he says, goes to the encouragement and support provided by Paras, a volunteer group set up by the Preventive Social Medicine (PSM) department of Surat’s New Civil Hospital, which helps rehabilitate sex workers.     Sulaxmi was brought by a pimp from Hyderabad to Gujarat. He duped her parents into thinking he would get her a job. He did. As a sex worker. Forced into the sex trade at 14, Sulaxmi was resigned to her fate. Till she became one of Paras's first success stories when Hitesh came along. The most special day of her life — her wedding — was organised by Paras volunteers. “We arranged the vows and held a small wedding reception in our office. The two looked very happy,” says PSM assistant professor Jayesh Kosambiya.     Today, Sulaxmi and Hitesh have a son. “I am a full-time home-maker and I love this new role. It is a life of respect,” says Sulaxmi, who has taken it upon herself to counsel roughly 1,000 sex-workers, bringing them together as part of two community-based organisations, Ekta and Sahyog.‘Love without wisdom brings trouble’TIMES NEWS NETWORK Kolkata: “Make God be your Valentine. We will never be ditched, deceived or deprived,” said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at a Satsang in Kolkata on Saturday when the city was in the grip of the Valentine’s Day fever. The Art of Living founder said the world is so distraught because of the absence of love.     “Even if there is love, the problem exists. Because, there is wrong expression of it. Love without wisdom (gyan) can also bring trouble. If love comes with wisdom, there will be joy, satisfaction and benediction,” he said addressing a crowd at the Rabindra Sarovar stadium.     On the attacks on people celebrating Valentine’s Day, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar said: “The extreme reaction comes out of fear. Our culture, heritage is not so fragile that one celebration would destroy it. There should be due respect to decency and decorum. But if you apply force against the violators, they will only increase. Force is no solution. Let it happen, if something is bad, people will reject it automatically.”     The Art of Living Guru prescribed five steps to get out of sufferings. First, you have to understand the time you are in. Secondly, do some Yoga and Sadhana. Yoga will stop bad things from happening in your life. Thirdly, think that you have overcome many a problem in your life and will eventually also overcome the problem causing you suffering. Next, you must understand that there are people whose suffering is much worse than yours. Put yourself in the ‘seva’ of that person. Finally, have complete faith in nature’s law — no suffering is perpetual. Suffering will come and go."},
{"title": "Two Sundays", "date": "Wednesday, February 4, 2009", "text": "I’ll talk about two great Sundays I had in recent times, activities just outside the campus. Before that an update on the activities inside the campus.Yesterday afternoon some NSS volunteers gathered in my office where we discussed about (i) improvement of our NSS team website http://teamvivek.50webs.com  - publication of monthly report, upgrading happenings section, uploading teaching modules developed etc. and (ii) purchases required for the current educational program for the underprivileged kids. Four of us (myself, NKR, Sujo.. and Abhiji..) then went to market – bought toffees, pencils, eraser and three beautiful five-in-one books, one each for the groups who have placed the  requirement. We all liked the books (published by Rainbow) having five different features like Hindi alphabets, English alphabets, Numbers etc. printed on a good quality paper, multi-coloured. We believe the kids will like it and it will enhance their education experience.   On 18th Jan., 2009 attended a one day meet, organized by Sarada Kalyan Bhandar, a charity run entirely by women. They are doing great work as can be found from their website www.skbcharity.com  The occasion was celebration of Swami Vivekananda’s birthday, the 12th of Januray which is declared ‘National Youth Day’ by Government of India. A youth convention was arranged where approximately 400 young men and women gathered. I was one of the panelists in a panel discussion but I preferred to listen more from others specially the younger people and reverend Swami Sunisthanandaji of Midnapore Ramakrishna Mission. Seldom one finds a person like Swami Sunisthanandaji with such clarity of thoughts, such a blend of Head and Heart. It appeared he has overcome all confusions of life and reached The Truth. Sitting on the stage, in front of a large audience, I couldn’t help being in my student self – taking running notes. May be on another post I’ll share them.    On 1st Feb., 2009, another Sunday, attended one more one day meet, organized by Kharagpur Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal(KVYM) at a Madrasa named Azizia School at Kharagpur. This meet was meant for school students from Class V to Class IX. Approximately, 80 students attended it. After flag hoisting, vedic chant – “Sanga Chhaddhang …” and reading out of famous ‘Swadesh Mantra’ of Swami Vivekananda, everybody assembled in the auditorium. A discourse on how to improve ‘Mental Concentration’, the practical steps for practicing it, was delivered which is important for everyone one of us, specially the school-goers. Then there was physical exercise, followed by discussions on ‘Character Building’ – why and how. In the second half, there was Q&A session where the students asked many beautiful questions. A short description of Swamiji’s life was presented. The valedictory session was graced by – yes, Swami Sunisthanandaji and everybody (students and their guardians) were charmed by his address which lasted over an hour. The camp ended by a flag down ceremony. KVYM is the Kharagpur unit of a pan-India organization named Akhil Bharat Vivekananda Yuva Mahamandal who works among the youths through more than 500 centres in spreading ‘Man Making and Character Building’ideals of Swami Vivekananda. Every year around this time, they organize a one-day meet like this."},

It feels my heart with joy and I feel proud about this IIT students owning up responsibilities like these. Excerpts from some of their feedbacks are given below.-----------Yesterday( On Sunday 18/1 ), we taught two boys working in the .... Their names are Samrat Singh and Bisu Singh. They got a very pleasant surprise when we presented to them the folder, the stationery and the toffees. It was heartening to see the smiles on their faces and to know that they liked the gift.Then, we asked them about their daily routine, their families and their pastime activities. Their homes are in Midnapur but they stay with their master in his residence and go to their homes once a month. Samrat had attended school for a month while Bisu hadn't gone to school. As it was the first day, we taught them how to write their names. Samrat just needed some brushing up as he had learnt it earlier. He knows to write his name in Bengali too. We have asked them to write their names five times by next week.Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the boys and us are looking forward to next week's meeting.------------We had a little bit of interaction with 2 boys of  .....  One of them was of age 8  and had done his schooling upto class 3rd, while the other one was of age 11 yrs but had no preliminary education.  so the latter didn't show any interest in our program even after repeated advice.  we had a brief interaction with former who showed a great interest in learning from us. we gave things that we got with us,and taught the basic essentials of reading and writing. He could very well write his name. since there was alphabetic books with us which could help him more with natural pictures, we could only teach him bit of basic mathematical work of addition and subtraction. The boy thoroughly enjoyed the experience with us and was even willing to come us on regular basis, perhaps he got this belief that there are some people still out there who are willing to help him to gain that preliminary education which he so dearly missed in his childhood due dire poverty and child labour.It  was great experience for me to interact with boy of such tender age and was overwhelmed seeing the joy in his face which speaks of volumes of happiness he gainedfor having education which was only a dream for him.  We are positively looking forward for our next interaction with him.------------Today we visited the milkmen area outside the campus near prembazar....i took care of the madhyaik student..he had some problems in trigonometry...i tried to solve them and make him understand...and nave.. helped him in english,specially in the grammar and writing portions....his exam is also knocking...it'll start from 25th...so i told him to come to my room if he has any problem...oderwise i will go next sunday.....Suja.. and Pratee.. were looking after the smaller kids (alphabets and numerals)...------------I along with my team-mates had visited the ... last Wednesday. In our 3rd attempt we finally got 2 students. None of them have never gone to school. It was a great experience of spending 1 hr with these kids. They have already shown their talent on painting. Looking forwards to our next meeting with lots of enthusiasm. ----------I along with my other group members started our job to teach child labors on last Wednesday,21st Jan. they were two- Shahrukh Khan & Biswajit Dolai. They  did not attend any school. For the first day we have started with little bit of drawing. They both enjoyed it. We are eagerly waiting for next meeting. -----------We went to the .... on Sunday to teach the boys. The ... master was ready for their education but the children were not ready to read. First they were not coming. Then we gave them the greed of chocolate that we were carrying with ourself. Then first one boy of the age approx 13 yrs came then 3 more students came out.     The eldest one told us that he has read till 6th and he wants to read English. He is able to write his name in English. But the problem was that he didn't know Hindi. Whatever he has read he has read in  Bengali. I wish to teach him translation but I can only teach him how to translate in to English from Hindi.     So, I started Grammer. Yesterday I taught him and an another boy parts of speech starting with Noun. The another boy has also studied till 5th and belong to the same group but has forgot everything. He doesn't even understand Hindi so well. But I managed him with the help of first one.     Vika.. taught an another boy  the alphabet. There was a child who knows Telugu. Another student ... who knows telugu taught him.--------And this is the blinderToday,i bought the study kit and presented it to thekid who works at a tea stall near the BC Roy hospital.He told me thathe works from 7 in the morning till 11 at night and is paid a derisorysalary of Rs 500 a month.He has a mother and a little sister tofeed.His mother has a permanently crippled hand as a result of afracture,and they could not provide her with good enough treatment.Hehas never been to school.He is 12,and his name is Hariom Patra.He hasa lot of friends of his age who have indulged in activities likestealing,pickpocketing,etc.And they jump over a wall to enter thecampus for stealing.But,Hariom says he would never steal in hislife,though his friends often provoke him to do so.He was so ecstaticto see me.             Since he has never been to a school before,he couldcount upto 30,and did not know the alphabet.I have kickstarted theprocess by teaching him English alphabet.When i tried teaching him theHindi alphabet,i came to know that I myself needed to revisethat.Therefore,i believe i should better have study modules or somebook to teach the Hindi alphabet.He seemed to be pretty much confusedabout addition;i began with simple additions involving things like acustomer coming to his little tea stall and buying things.He quicklylearnt that;he is pretty acute.He can't even read words in Hindi,leaveaside English words.So,some very elementary things need to be taughtto him,though its a different matter that the kind of life he livesteaches things the hard way.------------I am proud of you all. May goddess Saraswati bless you all and your superlative efforts. Pray for me that I am also blessed."},

The teen had a peculiar problem. Whenever he got angry with anyone he tried to strangle his mother. The hapless woman had to bear the brunt of several such attacks before she and her husband realized that there was something psychologically wrong with their child.     “The boy is suffering from what is known as impulse dysfunction disorder. Whenever he is denied anything he vents his anger on his mother. She represents the forces that deny him happiness. Some 20 years ago, we got such cases very rarely. Now the number is going up. What is worrying is that in the coming decade impulse dysfunction disorder will become commonplace,” said Mullick.     Teenagers suffering from this disorder cannot control their rage. Psychiatrists contend that it is very important to learn how to channelise their anger. A child with impulse dysfunction disorder has a change in the behavioral pattern.     “Youngsters are growing up fast these days, thanks to early exposure to violence and adult material through the media. They believe violence is the solution to problems which they can’t handle or even understand fully. In this (Subhrajyoti Ghosh’s) case, the normal reaction of a 14-yearold would have been to cut himself off from his grandparents or, at worst, behave rudely with them. But this boy was obviously not happy with that. He wanted to teach them a lesson in the way heroes treat villains. He obviously has a major personality disorder,” said psychiatrist Shiladitya Ray.     Psychiatrists feel that teenagers of today are prone to behaving like young adults. “Fifty per cent of these teenagers behave like adults without realizing the responsibilities of an adult and the implications,” Ray said. “They don’t realize the consequences of their action. After they complete their act, they understand that it was something wrong. It is very important to keep watch on the teenager and realize that a change is coming up.”     Subhrajyoti, psychiatrists say, kept his grief and rage bottled up. Which is why, when he was planning the attack, he did not betray any sign of emotion or tension. Not even till the few seconds before the first strike, or after, when police arrived.     Mullick feels that 14-15 year-olds should now be treated as adults. Fifty per cent of them, he says, have grown up prematurely. “Wanting to take revenge has now become very commonplace among teenagers. They are obviously inspired by the movies which offer it as a solution. It is here that parents have a major role to play. Lack of guidance and monitoring is squarely responsible for this dangerous trend,” said Mullick.     Psychiatrist Satyabrata Kar agreed. Parents often fail to notice the behavioural changes in their wards till it is too late. “Losing temper too often, getting physical or hurling objects are the early warning signals. Parents should take note of these indications and be cautious,” said Kar.     “In the next 10-12 years, these cases will become more frequent,” Mullick feared."},

It could be an eye opener for the young professionals/would-be-professionals. The increasingly neglected value based family system has tremendous power which we are forgetting in our material pursuit. The news item tells the rest.AMBITIOUS, YOUNG & SUDDENLY CLUELESSLaid-Off BPO Generation Wilts Under Depression, AnxietyWritankar Mukherjee KOLKATA     WHEN Rahul Kher landed his first job as a foot soldier in the then unassailable Indian IT brigade some two years ago, he thought he’d made it. The 22-year-old engineering graduate from Kolkata promptly moved to Bangalore, took up his job, and started planning ahead. It was 2006, banks were chasing successful youngsters like Rahul with easy housing loans, and he bought his first asset — a twobedroom apartment in South Bangalore. In August 2008, at the age of 24, Rahul married his childhood sweetheart Ishita, who moved in with him and got her first job in a bank. Things couldn’t have been better. Both Rahul’s and Ishita’s parents, in their 50s, were still employed, and the DINK (double income-no kids) couple began in right earnest to build up its dream home.     Ishita put all her savings — Rs 60,000 — into a 42-inch plasma TV that hung on the their living room wall. Rahul didn’t blink twice before taking another bank loan — to buy a new Alto.     And then their world came crashing down.     The top-rung IT company that Rahul worked for saw its clients — mostly mid-sized US banks — vanish as a series of bankruptcies began to hit Wall Street. A due diligence was in order to identify “non-critical” functions that could be downsized. Youngsters draw strength from family     ON November 10, 2008, Rahul got a call from the HR department. He, along with 20 others, had just been laid off. Two weeks later, Ishita lost her job.    In the couple of weeks that they remained in Bangalore, Rahul and Ishita sold off their apartment, the Alto went to a friend, and the plasma TV landed in the secondhand market for Rs 27,000. The couple moved back to the extended family in Kolkata.     Today, Rahul, 24 is a shattered man, under psychiatric help for depression at his family home where he now lives with Ishita.     Ambitious, young, and suddenly clueless, Rahul represents the underbelly of India’s famed BPO generation which only saw growth but now finds itself suddenly defenceless in a slowing economy.     “These young professionals were getting used to enjoying a comfortable life and a sense of freedom. The slowdown has hit them very hard,” says Dr Jairanjan Ram, consultant psychiatrist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in Kolkata, who is treating Kher.     And then there are those who had just a few months at the crest of the wave. Like Richa Sharma, 25, a masters in computer application from Pune, who got her first job at a prominent IT firm in June 2008, only to be put on the bench in October, and laid off in December.     Today, recovering from a nervous breakdown, Richa may take three more months to be her normal bubbly self, says her father Sudhir Sharma, a pensioner.     Leading hospitals across the country are reporting a wave of patients like Rahul and Richa, in their 20s, suffering from anxiety, depression and sleeplessness, all induced by a declining job market in a slowing economy. India’s economic growth is expected to slip to around 7% this year from an average of 9%-plus growth seen in the preceding three years.     “In the past three months, there has been a 25% jump in the number of such patients and the most common complaints are depression and anxiety,” says Dr Murali Raj, head of department of psychiatry at Bangalore’s Manipal Hospital. The city is synonymous with India’s IT boom and is home to some of the country’s biggest IT firms.     Hospitals in Mumbai also register a lot of women patients, suffering from depression. “Many of these girls are now postponing their marriages. The economic boom had created women’s empowerment in the job market, and with the slowdown, this is beginning to disappear,” says Dr Parul Tank, consultant psychiatrist at Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai.     In Delhi, doctors at Escorts Hospital say they get about 7 to 8 patients a day with symptoms of depression induced by the economy. Says Escorts’ clinical psychologist, Dr Srividya Rajaram: “Their main concerns revolve around tiding over the career uncertainties. Several of my corporate clientele also suffers from depression and many confess they are going easy on their lifestyle. Some even want expert advice on how best to cope with such economy-induced lifestyle changes.”     KPMG’s head of human capital practice, Ganesh Shermon, affirms Dr Rajaram’s view but feels that Indian youngsters are still better off than their global counterparts. “The extended family system we have here and the social milieu help in such occasions,” he says.     Rahul, Ishita and Richa will agree.     After all, as the job market went into a sudden huddle, it was their families that came to their rescue.     “To me, it all (the job phase) feels like something that happened somewhere else to some one. And I have to thank my family for helping me land on my feet,” says Ishita.     “I am just waiting for Richa to be herself again. I will reason with her to choose a more stable career like teaching,” says Sudhir Sharma, Richa’s father."},
{"title": "Mediocrity to Satyam Tragedy", "date": "Wednesday, January 7, 2009", "text": "Welcome to the new semester!For some days was having many discussions with different group of students-mostly 2nd year, completing 3 semesters in IIT. Most of them are on their downhill journey because of the widespread 'peace maro' (take it easy) attitude - neglecting academics, leaving everything to the last two weeks before semester exam. and/or low/high level 'cheating'! It is worth reading Satyam's founder, ex-CEO, Ramalingam Raju's parting letter - \"...The gap in the Balance Sheet has arisen purely on account of inflated profits over a period of last several years (limited only to Satyam standalone, books of subsidiaries reflecting true performance). What started as a marginal gap between actual operating profit and the one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years. It has attained unmanageable proportions as the size of company operations grew significantly...\"Coming back to IIT student life, not only most of the students are suffering from this disease of indulging in mediocrity themselves they are also spreading these disease being a carrier like any other person affected with a contagious disease. And this is one of the reason why others have a say in the way a student (or for that matter, anybody) leads his your life and cannot say it is entirely a personal matter. Because an individual is not a system isolated, neither one can keep everything oneself entirely. As a corrupt person wants to make other corrupt, a person even after suffering himself from 'peace maro' attitude tries to propagate that idelogy to others. Satyam's Raju continues \"...Every attempt made to eliminate the gap failed. As the promoters held a small percentage of equity, the concern was that poor performance would result in a take-over, thereby exposing the gap. It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten...\"Back to IIT student life. The other issue that cannot be avoided is - a poor acad. record cannot make a student happy, however best he tries to hide this fact, often propagating false and a failed theory of mediocrity. A person cannot be happy remaining in a steady state. Life demands moving from one orbit to a higher orbit to become happy. Now, how does it matter if one chose to be not happy? An unhappy person radiates unhappiness - makes other, his family members, friends, neighbours unhappy. They in turn propagate unhappiness. And someday, after a time lag, it will reach you, me and everybody. That way each of us has a stake, has a role in seeing, making others happy. The point I want to make here - mediocrity make each of us operate in two modes  - as a sufferrer, as a carrier. While as a sufferer I am free to decide being a matured, adult, individual whether to continue to suffer; as a carrier I am not free in that sense and own a responsibility to the society. Why don't we move from this to a different culture which is more fulfilling? Let's enjoy life in its entirety. Life has many dimesions. Let's explore them. Let's divide the time appropriately among study, sports, travel (say, trekking), weekend bash, reading novels, watching movie (for some of you it could be some of that stuff too...which always made you inquisitive at this age...), social service, attending cultural evenings, visiting places of religious or social interest etc. etc. It helps you to diversify. Being unidimesional in life is like putting all your eggs in one basket. No intelligent person will do that. Without doing well in acad. can you really be at peace, forget about enjoying life?Let's do our bit to arrest the spread of this disease called mediocrity. Let's see that the excellent input to the IIT system do not leave this place after 4 years being devalued to just ordinary. Yes, 10-15% of you really do justice to yourself and the institute in these 4 years of transformationals process. But such will happen in any probabilistic model. In any population 10-15% will be excellent. In our case, the population itself is the cream of the nation, the best of the bests. Any standard model should have generated 90-95% students as excellent products. The students admitted its because of the prevalent 'take it easy' culture. Senior students carry this to the juniors. IIT brand confirming a good job or only a good knowledge of programming language required for high paid job are not helping either. I hope the present recession and poor placement season of 2008-2009 will be an eye opener and bring some sanity. Still, it is not easy to change something as any new thing has to go through a phase of ridicule and then opposition before being accepted. But the IITians are among the best and the brightest in the country and they can always find a way if they want. Coming back to Satyam fraud (and other bubbles that put the skeletons out of the cupboard in international space in recent times) - it is worthwhile to take note of path taken by so called smart and educated people who uses dishonesty to outsmart others. It needs a Satyam (ironically, Satyam means the Truth) to see why we need to be honest. We need a Mumbai attack to make us feel patriotic. Why not before? Why not it is a part of our bringing up? This evening my daughter, studying in Class I, was going through one of her lessons which read like this. \"Feel happy when your friends do well in something. If there is a running race, everyone cannot win. You will win in something else. .... Always be cheerful. When you are full of fun and cheer, you make your classmates happy too..... and so on.\"But have we taken these lessons seriously or extrapolated in our day to day life?Many students have given this feedback. The seniors have told them that having a certificate on social service work is useful for resume and gives better job opportunity. Accordingly, many of them are engaged in so called 'social work' through various groups that promises certificate. It sends a shiver down the spine to think of where mediocrity can lead to. IIT students are acknowledged as smart. But is there any limit? Isn't it riding on a tiger that Raju mentioned in his fax message.When a big tree falls, everbody notices. But the process starts much earlier as Raju says that it started with a 'marginal gap'. Have such gaps crept in our life, our society too? Then what has happened to Satyam today can happen to me, my society tomorrow. We are today talking about corporate governance. Does it not it start from self-governance? Where is the effort to build character?Satyam is a national tragedy. Let that not happen to you, me and anybody. Let us control our greed and lead a balanced, multi-dimensional life.Let's not deceive ourselves. Let's act and now.----------------------------------------------The clippings : Satyam's Ex-Chairman's parting message and message of interim CEO immediately after assuming officeThe chairman of Satyam Computer Services resigned on Wednesday, saying profits had been inflated over the last several years.Following is the text of his letter, which was released by the Bombay Stock Exchange.To the Board of DirectorsSatyam Computer Services Ltd.From B. Ramalinga RajuChairman, Satyam Computer Services Ltd. January 7, 2009Dear Board Members,It is with deep regret, and tremendous burden that I am carrying on my conscience, that I would like to bring the following facts to your notice:1. The Balance Sheet carries as of September 30, 2008a. Inflated (non-existent) cash and bank balances of 50.40 billion rupees ($1.04 billion) (as against 53.61 billion reflected in the books).b. An accrued interest of 3.76 billion rupees which is non-existent.c. An understated liability of 12.30 billion rupees on account of funds arranged by me.d. An overstated debtors position of 4.90 billion rupees (as against 26.51 billion reflected in the books)2. For the September quarter (Q2) we reported a revenue of 27.00 billion rupees and an operating margin of 6.49 billion rupees (24 pct of revenues) as against the actual revenues of 21.12 billion rupees and an actual operating margin of 610 million rupees (3 percent of revenues). This has resulted in artificial cash and bank balances going up by 5.88 billion rupees in Q2 alone.The gap in the Balance Sheet has arisen purely on account of inflated profits over a period of last several years (limited only to Satyam standalone, books of subsidiaries reflecting true performance). What started as a marginal gap between actual operating profit and the one reflected in the books of accounts continued to grow over the years. It has attained unmanageable proportions as the size of company operations grew significantly (annualized revenue run rate of 112.76 billion rupees in the September quarter, 2008, and official reserves of 83.92 billion rupees). The differential in the real profits and the one reflected in the books was further accentuated by the fact that the company had to carry additional resources and assets to justify higher level of operations -- thereby significantly increasing the costs.Every attempt made to eliminate the gap failed. As the promoters held a small percentage of equity, the concern was that poor performance would result in a take-over, thereby exposing the gap. It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.The aborted Maytas acquisition deal was the last attempt to fill the fictitious assets with real ones. Maytas' investors were convinced that this is a good divestment opportunity and a strategic fit. Once Satyam's problem was solved, it was hoped that Maytas' payments can be delayed. But that was not to be. What followed in the last several days is common knowledge. I would like the Board to know:1. That neither myself, nor the Managing Director (including our spouses) sold any shares in the last eight years -- excepting for a small proportion declared and sold for philanthropic purposes.2. That in the last two years a net amount of 12.30 billion rupees was arranged to Satyam (not reflected in the books of Satyam) to keep the operations going by resorting to pledging all the promoter shares and raising funds from known sources by giving all kinds of assurances (Statement enclosed, only to the members of the board). Significant dividend payments, acquisitions, capital expenditure to provide for growth did not help matters. Every attempt was made to keep the wheel moving and to ensure prompt payment of salaries to the associates. The last straw was the selling of most of the pledged share by the lenders on account of margin triggers.3. That neither me, nor the Managing Director took even one rupee/dollar from the company and have not benefitted in financial terms on account of the inflated results.4. None of the board members, past or present, had any knowledge of the situation in which the company is placed. Even business leaders and senior executives in the company, such as, Ram Mynampati, Subu D, T.R. Anand, Keshab Panda, Virender Agarwal, A.S. Murthy, Hari T, S.V. Krishnan, Vijay Prasad, Manish Mehta, Murali V, Sriram Papani, Kiran Kavale, Joe Lagiola, Ravindra Penumetsa; Jayaraman and Prabhakar Gupta are unaware of the real situation as against the books of accounts. None of my or Managing Director's immediate or extended family members has any idea about these issues.Having put these facts before you, I leave it to the wisdom of the board to take the matters forward. However, I am also taking the liberty to recommend the following steps:1. A Task Force has been formed in the last few days to address the situation arising out of the failed Maytas acquisition attempt. This consists of some of the most accomplished leaders of Satyam:, Subu D, T.R. Anand, Keshab Panda and Virender Agarwal, representing business functions, and A.S. Murthy, Hari T and Murali V representing support functions. I suggest that Ram Mynampati be made the Chairman of this Task Force to immediately address some of the operational matters on hand. Ram can also act as an interim CEO reporting to the board.2. Merrill Lynch can be entrusted with the task of quickly exploring some Merger opportunities.3. You may have a restatement of accounts' prepared by the auditors in light of the facts that I have placed before you.I have promoted and have been associated with Satyam for well over twenty years now. I have seen it grow from few people to 53,000 people, with 185 Fortune 500 companies as customers and operations in 66 countries. Satyam has established an excellent leadership and competency base at all levels. I sincerely apologize to all Satyamites and stakeholders, who have made Satyam a special organization, for the current situation. I am confident they will stand by the company in this hour of crisis.In light of the above, I fervently appeal to the board to hold together to take some important steps. Mr. T.R. Prasad is well placed to mobilize support from the government at this crucial time. With the hope that members of the Task Force and the financial advisor, Merrill Lynch (now Bank of America) will stand by the company at this crucial hour, I am marking copies of this statement to them as well.Under the circumstances, I am tendering my resignation as the chairman of Satyam and shall continue in this position only till such time the current board is expanded. My continuance is just to ensure enhancement of the board over the next several days or as early as possible.l am now prepared to subject myself to the laws of the land and face consequences thereof.(B. Ramalinga Raju)Copies marked to:1. Chairman SEBI2. Stock Exchanges-----The interim CEO's damage control exercise is worth reading.Dear colleagues,I write this mail to update you on some critical Board and Leadership level changes in our company, effective immediately. A series of extremely unfortunate events led to this, which I am sure you have seen covered in the media over the past few hours.A SWAT team consisting of senior leaders has been formed. Many of them are Satyam veterans with a minimum of ten years experience in our company and more than twenty years in the industry. I have been requested to play the role of an Interim CEO and this team will support me, as we steer Satyam through this challenging phase. These are the leaders on the ground and have always had the final call on most customer and associate related matters in the company, so far.This team has committed to work together, to make it happen. The SWAT team represents all Customer Facing units, key Horizontal Competency Units and critical Support Units. Over the past twenty one years, with your passion and commitment we have built significant customer assets, formidable service offerings, excellent delivery processes and scalable support systems.Satyam has been consistently acknowledged for our leadership bandwidth and has a demonstrated reputation for collaborative functioning. Our renowned Full Life Cycle (FLC) model encouraged ‘Distributed and Empowered’ leadership and prepared us for all situations.This is the time when we have to apply it in real life. What we have been trained for, we will now put to work. Let us continue to handle our respective areas with total autonomy, freedom and control. This is as good a time, as any, to remind ourselves that we have been acknowledged as being amongst the top three Best Employers in India by Hewitt and Mercer in independent surveys in 2007 and American Society of Training & Development (ASTD) named us as the best globally, for our Learning practices – the first company outside USA to be ever awarded this honor. Satyam continues to have everything that is fundamentally required for its success – a strong customer base and a committed universe of approx 53,000 associates.What we are confronted with is the challenge of continuing our business operations, seamlessly. We will need your involvement and ideas to make it happen. This might involve even more effort at every level, in the near term. This is the time to prove to the world that we are united and will succeed in overcoming the challenges.This quarter will be tumultuous for us. Rumors will abound and it would be fair to assume that competition will try and leverage it to their advantage. As a proactive measure, we have formed fully empowered Cross Functional Teams, headed by seasoned leaders in the respective areas, to address pan-organizational issues like Delivery Excellence, Customer & Associate Retention, Pipeline Management, Cost Controls, Collections etc. You have helped to build Satyam to be what it is today - and we believe that this cannot be allowed to fail, at any cost. I am confident that I can count on your continued support as I commit to our customers that we will ensure deliverables and commitments are serviced.On behalf of our new leadership team, I apologize to you for the uncertainty and inconvenience that this incident has caused to you and your families. I assure you that we will emerge stronger, because of this. Increased focus on transparency at all levels, integrity and ethical functioning will be ensured. I want you to stand confidently in front of your families and friends and say that we will now be a better company and that we shall soon be a successful case study of how organizations have turned over a new leaf.We will be conducting “U Speak” (our Meet-the-Leadership sessions) in each city in India starting next week and will have numerous Webinars to address associates in various countries.We will be meeting many of our customers in person over the next two weeks and will meet those of you onsite, at that time. In these sessions, we will explain to you what happened and articulate the actions that are being taken to retain your confidence in our company.Let us fight this battle together. I am confident that we will emerge stronger, TOGETHER.Ram Mynampat"},
{"title": "Imitation of Christ", "date": "Saturday, December 27, 2008", "text": "This is Christmas time. Was reading a translation of 'Imitation of Christ' written by Thomas A Kempis, first published in Latin in 1418. The translation was by Swami Vivekananda who always had a high regard for Christ and this text (so much so that it always accompanied him.) Some excerpts from www.----------Of prudence in actionWe must not trust every word of others or feeling withinourselves, but cautiously and patiently try the matter, whetherit be of God.  Unhappily we are so weak that we find it easier tobelieve and speak evil of others, rather than good.  But theythat are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer,for they know man's weakness that it is prone to evil andunstable in words. This is great wisdom, not to be hasty in action, or stubbornin our own opinions.  A part of this wisdom also is not tobelieve every word we hear, nor to tell others all that we hear,even though we believe it.  Take counsel with a man who is wiseand of a good conscience; and seek to be instructed by one betterthan thyself, rather than to follow thine own inventions.  A goodlife maketh a man wise toward God, and giveth him experience inmany things.  The more humble a man is in himself, and the moreobedient towards God, the wiser will he be in all things, and themore shall his soul be at peace.Of the knowledge of truthAll perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in thislife, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness.  Alowly knowledge of thyself is a surer way to God than the deepsearching of man's learning.  Not that learning is to be blamed,nor the taking account of anything that is good; but a goodconscience and a holy life is better than all.  And because manyseek knowledge rather than good living, therefore they go astray,and bear little or no fruit.O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice and the planting of virtue which they give unto vainquestionings: there had not been so many evil doings andstumbling-blocks among the laity, nor such ill living amonghouses of religion.  Of a surety, at the Day of Judgment it will be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we have done;not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived.  Tellme, where now are all those masters and teachers, whom thouknewest well, whilst they were yet with you, and flourished inlearning?  Their stalls are now filled by others, who perhapsnever have one thought concerning them.  Whilst they lived theyseemed to be somewhat, but now no one speaks of them.Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanitiesHe that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,(1) saith theLord.  These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how farwe must imitate His life and character, if we seek trueillumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart.  Letit be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the lifeof Jesus Christ.It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the richesthat shall perish.  It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and tolift up ourselves on high.  It is vanity to follow the desires ofthe flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at thelast.  It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have littlecare for a good life.  It is vanity to take thought only for thelife which now is, and not to look forward to the things whichshall be hereafter.  It is vanity to love that which quicklypasseth away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abideth."},
{"title": "NSS Camp", "date": "Thursday, December 25, 2008", "text": "Merry Christmas! Let Christmas bring peace and happiness to every soul, in every nook and corner of the world. This post is about something that happened a month back. It had been a busy December. If time permits, shall come back with other experiences of this month.It was a great experience to be at the NSS camp during Nov. 26, 2008 to Dec. 03, 2008 in a village surrounding 6 km from IITkgp campus. Approximately, 140 first year students and few faculty members like us were engaged in discovering India that remains largely unseen to urban privileged class and in turn it was a journey to discover ourselves.The following are some of the excerpts I had with volunteers after the camp following the group mail I posted.  (Pls. overlook grammatical errors as I didn't wish to edit anything and post as the students saw and expressed)One cannot but be reassured to see future India emerging out of the youth of India. Also the role of programs like NSS (specially in institutes like IITs where leader of the futures are made) need to be emphasized that trains young mind, acts as interface and enabler between the capacity building (which IIT does) and right use of that capacity.---------------------------Dear NSS Volunteers,   Hope you have all reached home safely or on your way.   It was wonderful to spend those eight days with you in the NSS camp 2008  and share each others dreams as related to nation building.   Let us all try our best to become a better human-being and work for the  betterment of our society.   We have experienced how team work can be a fun, how satisfactory it is to  work for the poor and needy. Let us continue with the good work.   Please send your feedback on how we can improve. Also suggest some  actionable items for the future.   Please don't negelect study, career. A better career gives a larger  foot-print, more capacity to serve others.   Please keep in touch. Let us all work together for a better, stronger  India.     Sincerely yoursG.....-------------Sir, i am a first year student (08arXXXX) who really enjoyed the discussions we  had together. we definitely have to think for the society and for the country as  a whole. It  felt good collecting clothes  for the poor and the needy ones and it also makes us realise how far we are  still from total development. I and my friends discuss about this matters  regarding the political situations, the corruption and the inefficiency of our  system whaich goes on to become a heated debate.i feel strange that iitians have  contributed very little to the society,where are all those iitians who pass out  every year? Even I may become one of them.but this camp like NSS makes us realize  our duty towards india.i have only shared a few things which goes in my mind. ....*****Dear sir and fellow NSS volunteers,This is Sh....., here to express  my views and suggestions for the betterment of NSS.From my experiences at  the camp, I learnt many things, most important of those values being the values  of sharing and selflessness. Helping the poor and others in need, is a very good  way to reach out to the less privileged of the Indians.These 8 days in  the camp have been very useful, helping us learn how we can spend our free time  helping others, instead of sitting idle and entertaining ourselves only. Had we  all gone back home after the end-sems we would have done just that. But I thank  the NSS officials for giving us this wonderful opportunity.Joyful  experiences amongst the company of my friends apart, this visit to a rural area  was very helpful in increaing my outlook. First of all, I had been to a village  a long time ago. This visit revived some of my memories, and I am very thankful  for that. I also made many new friends, which helped in my personality  development.The collection of clothes for the poor from the campus was a  very notable exercise in many ways. First it helped all in actively  participating in the camp. Second, we got to interact with many persons living  in the camp unknow to us. Also. their feedback was valuable, and the amount in  which they donated was notable. ......*****Dear Sir,           We  too enjoyed those 8 days.          I have reached home safely. It was a nice experience to work &  play in the lap of mother  nature which many of us have not done before.       Thanks Sir . You & your collegues have  guided in an extremely  friendly manner.        In my view the camp was  a great success.          I have enjoyed the kichhuri the most.           I cannot forget the  early winter morning cycling experience  through the soft village road.          The camp days are now  sweet dreams to me......***Sir,Thank you for taking such a personal interest and inofrming us of  your views. But more than that sir, thank you for making the camp such a  wonderful experience for all of us.I have already given my views during the  group interaction on the final day. If ever NSS requires the help from any  volunteers, kindly let us know.***Sir ,      I being a student,who took part in NSS camp I really enjoyed it.I am a student in your weekly classes also .I didn't find this much spirit to work for NSS  in those classes.Its better to continue like those (performed in camp) in our weekly classes also.Its better to prepare our schedule in that  way so that we must be able to accomplish a work like coleecting clothes or keeping surroundings clean.     I think that every student will enjoy like that thing.     I felt happy that you are asking for students suggetions about this NSS work ..."},

Telecon. with US firm interested in our research starts at 10 pm and continues up to 11 pm. And there are need to travel (present our work for IIT, get fund for projects etc.) and meet different deadlines.Last night went to bed at 11 pm. Today woke up at 5:30 am. Had driving lesson from 6 am till 7 am. Dropped daughter at school at 7:30 am. Went for 45 minute morning walk at 8:00 am. Started office work at 9:00 am by replying to a PhD scholar's query, one hour lecture class etc. It is lunch time now. Shall pick up daughter from school on way back home for lunch.A good beginning indeed!Endnote : While learning driving there wasn't much of a confusion for the leftmost foot pedal i.e. 'Clutch' as it was dedicated to the left foot. The right foot has to take care of other two pedals 'Brake' and 'Acceleration'. I must say that often I pressed 'Acceleration' when I was supposed to press 'Brake' :-)Rejoinder (1) : Returning from lunch, within a hour of this posting, I find two messages worrying about my health. One from Hyderabad, my ex-student, the other from a IIT Guwahati faculty, my friend. Also a research scholar from Maharashtra rang few minutes back to discuss some technical matter. He finished saying that he likes my blog specially the posts on Vivekananda. Thanks everybody. Don't worry. I'll take care of myself. Above 40, everybody develops one health problem or the other. Nothing special. Compared to many, I am more fit. But there is no room for complacency. I'll be careful. Thanks once again.(2) : The meeting started one hour early at 4:30 pm and continued till 7:30 pm. Another meeting is required on Friday 11:30 am after a 8:30-10:30 double lecture and 10:30 to 11:30 another meeting. The MT.. student whose presentation was scheduled at 4:30 pm may not be happy, I feel bad about it. It is rescheduled on Friday afternoon. Leaving office for home now at 7:45 pm. Need to improve!(3) : Another social invitation in Dec. has just arrived! The moment of truth for one of my colleague. The function will be held in Kolkata."},
{"title": "American Dream - The Untold Story", "date": "Thursday, October 30, 2008", "text": "This I found in letters to editor in Times of India Oct. 31, 2008 web edition following a disturbing piece of news. An Indian techie killed all family members apparently after loosing his job. The young in India often chase overseas dream, perhaps driven by the success stories, not knowing the other side of the coin. This is not to say that they shouldn't do that, rather to say that they should take an informed decision. Some of the view expressed comes only when goes thro' grinding of life, may appear a bit philosophical but may be useful to younger generation.santosh, New jersey, says: Very very sad to hear this tragedy again.. ! Why educated people become so flustrated when then loose jobs & try to kill their loved ones which were so innocent..!! Looking at his age, he must be in US for last 10 yrs. must have earned & saved a lot till now(in Indian Rupees). He could have gone back to India & can spend rest of his lives there[31 Oct, 2008 0201hrs IST]Vishal, NY, Berlin,Mumbai, says: Sir I remember my days few years ago. I was 24...I had lost my job. I went home almost crying. Cursing everyone...but my parents told me that 'you want enjoyment of US culture but don't want to share risk behind them. This is not going to happen, hire and fire will be policy'. hhhmm Good Learning Lesson... It is not at all bad to loose a job...but the problem with Indian Mindset ( or Asian Mind) is..we attach our EGO with job that we do. Because How otherwise we rise our Status , Pride among our relatives. So Economic downturn , Loosing a Job and Getting a New one ..is a very natural cycle. [31 Oct, 2008 0452hrs IST]noname, Denver, says: All those are living the American dream - please wake up - for the dream is over. If you don't wake up now you will be woken up very harshly over the next 6 months. For all those successful NRIs out there - the word may be \"evacuation\". A terrible storm comes thy way. [31 Oct, 2008 0452hrs IST]ssunil, SanFrancisco, says: It is so sad. Indian H1 holders are citizens of US. India companies never hire H1 holders in USA unless they do not have any other alternaative to bring people on H1 or L1 from India. I have seen all major companies do it. IT IS SLOW DOWN. WHY SHOULD GOVT OF INDIA EXTEND ALL SUPPORT, EXTEND TAX CUT ETC TO THESE COMPANIES WHEN THEY DO NOT SUPPORT INDIAN CITIZENS. Patriotism is only for citizens and NOT for companies.[31 Oct, 2008 0321hrs IST]Rakesh, USA, says: USA is a country that strictly follows the economic cycle. When it is UP you should conserve money for the next downward spiral - not very difficult for Indians who are born with a saving mentality. But at the same time due to our family values, we cannot divorce spouses and just runaway like others here. Also, remember that it is no more the country of George Washington or Abraham Lincoln - the pictures our minds conjures up when we line up for visas. Also, if any techie is still living in hiding (200,000 as estimated by INS) try to get out of the country with the help of the embassy. Ego and shame should not cloud their mind. Because even though Obama is not antagonistic to Indians, the typical Indian ideas like backdoor citizenship by getting children born here will not be encouraged. Relatives also may not be able to help much as they have gone through the credit system of expensive education, home and car buying , though that they may not show when they land at Indian airports coming on vacations. Techies who had their education India with no such expenses. Any way the post-y2k laissez faire won't happen again as demographic goals of immigration is reaching their limits. They are closing the loopholes one by one. We Indians and Philippinos were allowed in en masse as democratic people by President Johnson to neutralize Jews after the assassination of Kennedy! [31 Oct, 2008 0306hrs IST]Eddy, Davis, CA, says: I think there is some kind of a stigma attached to a person having migrated to the USA (where it is still thought in some quarters that the streets are paved with gold) to return to India, penniless and a failure. This is specially so in cases where the groom has been described by the family to the bride as a successful NRI in America. Techies should diversify their talents and not take out their frustration on their spouses and innocent children. All techies that lose their jobs should be offered counselling![31 Oct, 2008 0252hrs IST]niko, Auck, NZ, says: There is lots more in life then only status. Many Indian's feel that once their job is lost, life is over and how will they face the society and here the society is to blame for it. Indian culture has to undergo a change, get more western and learn to respect all sort of jobs. I have observed that those mainly from Hyderabad worship IT professionals, there is nothing great in it at all. I would not want my son to get into IT which is such a demanding field, I would rather want my kids to enjoy life and learn how to be able to take on real life challanges.[31 Oct, 2008 0238hrs IST]Ramesh , US, says: Let me tell you one thing folks, one has to fight this life, i have been out of job for 4 months and have 2 kids and a housewife. I have been doing small jobs to keep my lifestyle low, this doesnt mean that one has to slaughter ones family to survive. My word to everyone is it may be hard to digest but folks please fight and never give up and their will be smiles in your life. Life is short make best use of it.[31 Oct, 2008 0214hrs IST]Arjun, sydney, says: Indian IT comapnies are taking jobs away from NRIs. Its high time NRIs should stop outsourcing for their own benefits only.[31 Oct, 2008 0208hrs IST]Deven, US, says: I am really nervous at this moment for those 2 kids and housewife. Indian male always prove their dominance on indian female. If they do not feel to live, they have every right to decide fate of their dependents. Let me tell all of you so called masculane characters that you have only developed skills to reproduce generation but not to carry them independently. To reproduce does not mean you are such great male. Masculanity actually means how well you carry them. Killing your dependents do not justify your affection to your family. Even if you die, they can survive. God has given them everything to survive in this world. I am also indian but I do not see taking control of freedom of my dependents as a part of my failure. [31 Oct, 2008 0202hrs IST]Sunny, FL, US, says: This is a sad incident. I am apalled why these guys don't return to India if they are facing such problems in the US? I am sure with the kind of experience that Rao had, he could have landed a decent job in the booming indian economy. Instead they end up destroying their own and their countrie's reputation. Indians will now be steriotyped in the US after second such incident[31 Oct, 2008 0152hrs IST]Uday, USA, says: Please don't do this to your family and self.

{"title": "Milestone", "date": "Monday, October 27, 2008", "text": "Yesterday was the one to reach an important milestone. It is interesting that another one coincided with that.Sandipan Chakroborty, my first PhD student completed his PhD defence viva yesterday. Congratulations! Sandipan. In the afternoon get-together, arranged by Dept. Society, HOD rightly pointed out how important and signficant is the experience to guide one's first PhD student. It was a challenge for both me and Sandipan to delve into a completely new area with a zero balance in the account i.e. withtout inheriting anything. We started from the scratch, struggled, made mistakes but never gave up. The journey took 4.5 years. Today it is all the more satisfying to have comment from Dean(PGS) like 'in recent times I have not seen such good comments on thesis from examiners'. The foreign examiner termed it as 'best thesis read'. Indian examiner, the Professor from IIT Madras said that the thesis would be preserved in their lab so that the research students learn from it how to work systematically.I was told to say a few words in the get together about Sandipan. I talked about a few things like his hard work, perseverence etc. What I didn't say that even after 9 months of leaving our lab I often find it more convenient to ask Sandipan clarifications of many silly things e.g. how to open files sent by our foreign collaborator in a new file format etc. This is because the green light in google had always been lit between us. And that has not changed even when he joined industry for a highly paid job in Feb. He continued to spend his spare time for research. How nice it would be to complete the cycle, to have him as faculty colleague here! Let's see what's in store for the futre.The other one to be considered as milestone may appear ridiculous to many. But it is really one for someone like me coming from a lower middle class background. Few days back, one senior Professor and Head was lamenting \"Given your background, contribution and effort you put in for the Dept.,Inst., you have not got a good deal as regard promotion\". I assured him that I have got too many great things in life to complain about a few things which I might not have yet got. I never thought I would be studying in IIT or become its faculty member. Given the financial hardship we went through since my family came from Bangladesh during partition of India, the survival was the only goal - to get a job and earn a square meal. And thus it becomes a milestone to book a Rs. 2.5 lakh Maruti 800 AC Uniq Limited Edition car in their Diwali offer. It happened yesterday, just after Sandipan's defence viva (in fact the dealer's agent was waiting for the seminar to be over and receive the cheque). Everybody in the family is excited. Ma, (now in Bandel, to return after brother's day) too appeared very happy on telephone. She had went through those trying times, the major part of her life. We always saw her face lighting up whenever there was any discussion regarding the purchase of a car. True that I always postponed it considering car is a luxury. But the 6th pay commission, arrear payment and the necessity to have a vehicle that can make four of us move together led to the decision, that the time has come.Pray that we all scale newer heights, reach many more milestones and make the most of our potential. Remember Vivekananda saying \"Each soul is potentially divine\" and \"Be Good and Do Good, that is the whole of religion.\""},
{"title": "Festival", "date": "Sunday, October 26, 2008", "text": "But I am not happy with myself! This is festival time. The best season of a year. Durga Puja, Diwali, Brother's Day etc. How much I longed for these and enjoyed these even a few years back! Even when future was so much uncertain. Thought that a Government job would be all fun, never mind the 0.33X salary. I shall have time for myself, family and friends and enjoy life to its full. Few days back somebody remarked what had been his motivation behind accepting a low paid Government job. To be able to say 'NO' to any undue pressure from boss which perhaps one cannot avoid in a high paid industry job.But being in IIT is more than a doing a Government job. There is so much opportunity! It is very difficult not to spend even the last single available minute for the cause. There is classroom teaching. There is project work under curricula - for me, mostly the disinterested bottomers, to extract work out of them! There are sponsored projects - 4 of them, its evaluation, delivery according to timelines! There are international collaborations to nurture which gives opportunity to grow exponentially! There is a requirement to extend support to research groups inside IIT whenever needed and also participate in team work like curricula development for new discipline! There are short term courses to be offered when such requests come from important Government functionary. There are research papers to review for others and own students. There are requests to be in technical committee or simply committee of many things. There are new frontiers to be explored i.e. submission of new research proposals. There are administartive work - playing host to visitors, being coordinator of various activities.....To top all these there are deadlines of different work elements for each each of above. With no secretarial facility it is a big pain to remember all of them and prepare for them. As I mentioned in some other post that I don't get bright students and my research students are just average. I am getting work from them keeping them fully focussed and dont want to delegate anything to them. It is difficult to explain this to many who think (from our group's contribution) that there are many students working with me and we have sufficient bench strength.And I would also like to point out that we too have responsibilities towards family and friends without whom we wouldn't have been here.The two works after my heart had been writing manuscript for the new editions of the two books and mentoring UG 1st and 2nd year NSS students. I wish I could give maximum time to these two activities as they can make maximum impact in the society as far as my contribution is concerned.  The Durga Puja vacation thus was mostly spent in manuscript writing. Coming Diwali would also be the same. The deadline is 31st Oct. for one book. Cannot but say 'No' to sister's earnest appeal to celebrate brother's day next week. No time for myself, family. I know that if I request the deadline will be extended again, for the second time. But I don't want do that repeatedly and dilute the high standard I had set in previous two editions of those two books. Let's see if my sister can make it to Kharagpur.I am very happay with my NSS team VIVEK (http://teamvivek.50webs.com/), a significant percentage of them are really serious. Hope and pray that I play my role sincerely in imbibing in this team the spirit of sacrifice and service and they become worthy citizen of this country. So far they have prepared to organize a kid's event of 2-3 hour duration which is 5-6 activity based like song, science expt., funny video, quiz, play zone, drama. The theme is patriotism but will be loaded with fun too. The plan is to host it in various primary schools around IIT Campus. Also they are developing teaching modules for kids who do not get formal education. Next week, we are starting a study circle within this team. First week the students proposed to take up 'Chicago Address' of Vivekananda 'I have a Dream' of Martin Luthar King.During Durga Puja visited Dakshineshwar and Belur Math on Saptami. Interacted with local club at our native place and partcipated in their philanthropic activity on Shasthi evening. Prepared one upgradation plan for the local public library. The Puja vacation was really enjoyable. Back here unhappy finding myself spread too far and too thin and nobody can take a 'NO'. I find my concentration level has reduced by few dB compared to what it had been in the Puja week. I am not enjoying it. I need to learn time management, ability to say 'No' and stay focussed. God, please help me!"},

I feel that it is my privilege to work with a team that has the likes of Sauptik, Shishir, Allen, Gautam Kumar (the 'Attention, Stand-at-ease person), Madhusudan, Sujay, Layak (he spoke at the end but did speak), Nibirh (\"we have manpower on our side\"), Koushik (Gopali Youth Welfare Soc. person, hardselling the idea of donating money :) ), Naveen, Robin, Dinakar, Pranoy, Deepak, Vikash, Prahlad, Sravan, Akhilesh, Sahil (appeared hungry after the psychological contribution :) ) , Sumeet, Shashank ...Today we tried to understand through discussion the objectve of NSS and how it is sought to be achieved based on the guidelines given to us in a handout. I must say that the discussion was lively and all inclusive and everybody contributed. I asked everybody to speak even if it is repetition of what one has already stated as the act of speaking itself is some kind of assertion. It helps in subscribing to the thought process of the group, removes complex, if any and develops team spirit. It was great to see everbody coming forward. Good work, boys!The NSS guidelines and and how the team interpreted it (summarized, in bracket) is presented next.The objective of NSS is \"Development of the Personality of Students through Community Service.\"(Developing ourselves. Making a better human being out of us. Transformation within us through the spirit of service. Not enforcing others. If at all, subconscious inspiration by doing our duty the best way possible.)This objective is sought to be achieved by enabling the students to :i) understand the community in which they work(staying close to thm, interacting with them, organizing events, understanding their psychology, taking care not to make them feel humiliated, daan combined with maan i.e. serving respectfully)ii) understand themselves in relation to their community(what is expected of a student, meeting and beating that expectation, active participation - not passive goodness, dynamicism of a youth)iii) identify the needs and problems in the community in the solution of which they can be involved(survey with specific objective, important to follow it up else negative perception, analogy from designer-tester race in industry, execution of the job with heart and also professionally)iv) development among themselves a sense of social and civic responsibility(proper use, upkeepment of public properties, amenities; a good starting point is abiding traffic rules and other rules of a civil society, behaving ourselves as a civilized person)v) apply their education in finding practical solutions to individual and community problems(education cannot be neglected, need to become a very good engineer, more capacity building is required as the objective is to serve more people, increase footprint, returning more to the society in absolute terms)vi) development of competence required for group living and sharing responsibilities(should do work with lot of interest, each & every member should own responsibility, unity, harmony)vii) gain skills in mobilizing community participation(kids activity, drama, organizing various events. drama group - Koushik, Madhusudan, Gautam (not me :) Gautam Kumar), Allen, Sauptik, Vikash)viii) acquire leadership qualities and democratic attitude(leading by examples, by love; some management skills needed - to take initiative, ability to coordinate etc. decision through democratic process and once taken no alienation)ix) develop capacity to meet emergencies and natural disasters(participate in programs of reputed NGOs lik Ramakrishna Mission. Can there be something more that uses our IIT backgroud to the benefit of the bereaved? e.g. Kosi river devastation, we cannot physically go as semester is in full swing - can we help in communication, networking, developing devices, mechanism that can come of use in calamities like these?)x) practice national intergration(imbibing the spirit of the patriots, observance of nationally important days in true spirit, participating in each others' festivals, removal of regional, religious, caste, any kind of bias that divides people)We decided to meet next week at 9 a.m. in Jnan Ghosh stadium and draw action items."},

But who can undestand the design of Him? Doesn't he often test by fire? He only knows what is the best for us. Ours is to depend on Him like a child and to do our work the best way possible considering each act of us is a offering at His feet. Joy and sorrow both teach us and perhaps sorrow teaches the most, removes false perception of this world, shatters false ego. However, negatives are often overpowering. Well, this is not the place to discuss negative things (it comes and goes, in everybody's life, nothing special, the earlier we learn to live with it or rise over it, the better...in fact, when I decided to stay in India after completion my IITkgp BTech rejecting a generous offer from US East Coast university I remained prepared that I might have to face both and perhaps more of the ugly side...that way I am lucky I got to see more  of the beautiful side of my country and doesn't West have its own dark secrets not much publicised here) as my student friends may read this blog. If required, my office emails, diary are carefully stored for the use of any investigating agency. I only pray that I get the opportunity to do my work in a sincere manner, unperturbed and not fall into their traps who want to destabilize me. After all, what is in a life? Remembering an Anup Jalota bhajan - Pitambari kasi ho, Chabi maan main yeh basi ho,Hotho pe kuch hasi ho, jab pran tan se nikle/Jab kanth pran aye, koi rog na sataye,Yam darash na dikhaye, Jab pran tan se nikle/us vakt jaldi ana, nahi Shyam Bhul Jana, Radhe ko saath lana, jab pran tan se nikle/ek bhakt ki hai arji, khud garj ki hai garji, age Tumhari marji jab pran tan se Nikle/Itna to karna Swami, Jab pran tan se Nikle.I was surprised to find so many different persons - two Prof.s, students, one person from Midnapore trying to inform me that Bishwarup Maharaj is coming to campus. I just returned from a 10 day busy tour in Canada where I attended three workshops and visited univ. of Waterloo, univ. of Toronto, univ. of Montreal, McGill univ and also met people of from univ. of Alberta, univ. of BC at Edmonton. I heard about Biswarup Maharaj before but didn't have the opportunity to interact with him. The talk on 'diaster management' was arranged in Mat. Sc. Dept. Maharaj spoke about flood relief work and emphasized on what Swami Vivekananda said, \"Men, men, these are wanted. Everything else will be ready.\" Are we that kind of man, Swamiji wanted? \"Strong, vigorous, believing young men, sincere to the backbone.\" If we are not, we have to strive to become one. The positive news flow continues. Once I found a beautiful email from Bishwarup Maharaj, first ever in my life from a monk. Earlier I got several SMS from Chiranjeev Maharaj. I am truly honoured to be in mailing list of Maharaj. His team at Ramakrishna Mission Students Home, Belgharia maintains an inspiring website http://www.vivvsc.co.nr/ Getting lots of idea, help, encouragement from friends and well-wishers far and wide. Prof. Kan.. from Boston was, as usual was at his kindest best generous with ideas. Jo... from UK finds one of our collaborative work publishable. Aru.. from US eager to help looking for funding opportunities for joint work. Pa.. of IPC.. also trying in spite of his busy schedule; P.. one day asked me to discuss our work with WMG, UK represenative who wants to collaborate in that area and now I am IITkgp-WMG initiative;  based on a reco.. started working on establishment of a new engineering scool on QEDM ...(I am the only Asst. Prof. in the team - may be my industry background, system level development, ability to work in a team, trustworthiness, positive attitude etc. earned my nomination); got lot of praise from people here whose work I presented in bio-nano area in Canada and how I apprised everybody of the opportunities there with a report, email id, ppt etc., someone commenting first of its kind in IITkgp; based on a reco.. stayed in IIT Madras for 8 days to do some very important national level work and there one morning my research student Sam.. rang. He was excited to tell me that our recent publication on heart sound in a new Hindwai journal has caught lot of attention and international media is covering it widely - Eurekalert, Yahoo News, Sciencedaily, Biomedicine news so on and so forth, websites in USA, UK, Russia, China ... And then I received the email from science reporter of German Public Radio. He wants to have my 10 minute telephonic interview for their Saturday program that is aired in Germany and many countries in Europe. The interview was conducted from guest house, next evening and airtime was approx. 6 min. with German voice over, intermittently my voice can be heard. One US medical co. representative expressed desire to visit us at IITkgp for collaboration and sent an NDA. Two more Indian TV channel wanted to interview us and show our work in their channel etc. Finally, I remember the confidence shown by some of my seniors on me specially the one firm voice at about 10 o' clock at night saying \"Goutam, No one can stop you.\" I shall put few images here and that will conclude this post.

{"title": "IIT students and those fateful happenings", "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2008", "text": "From Hindustan Times : June 30, 2008---- QUOTE ----It’s not the tough syllabus or academic pressure that is responsible for students committing suicide, according to authorities at IIT Kanpur. Suicides occur because students are not as insulated from their families back home as they used to be earlier, they said in response to questions raised under the Right to Information Act. Excessive use of mobile phone — which even 10 years ago were hardly seen — to stay in touch with family and friends is the real culprit. Mobile phones connect the students 24x7 with their family and make them a part of every problem arising at home. There are also constant exhortations from parents to do well, which create tremendous pressure. \"Earlier, students had the facility of only landline phone; they had little interaction with the family and were more focused on their studies,” said the reply received by the Bharat Punarnirman Dal, a national association of IIT alumni, which had raised questions under the RTI following the suicide of a student, Toya Chatterjee, on June 2. There have been six suicides in the past three years at IIT Kanpur. Another culprit was Internet use by students at odd hours, authorities said in the reply. It left them unsettled.Director of IIT Delhi, Surendra Prasad, however, told HT that mobile phones and internet cannot be linked to suicides.  \"To reach such a conclusion you need to sociologically study past history and data and do a detailed survey. At IIT Delhi we have not done any such thing,\" Prasad said, when asked for his reaction. IIT, Delhi recently limited the amount of data that students could download on their hostel computers during the wee hours (1 am to 5 am). But this was done to ensure that students did not stay up late night. \"The faculty was of the opinion that late usage of internet leads to neglect of studies and other consequences,\" said Prasad. Professor Prakash Gopalan, Dean, Students' Welfare, IIT-Bombay, said: \"Some families do pressurise their kids, but there are also families who don't do that. We can't really say that the Internet and mobile phones drive students to suicide as there are many parents who act as support systems via Internet and cellphones.\""},
{"title": "Summer Quarter Experience", "date": "Wednesday, June 4, 2008", "text": "Yesterday, I had the most satisfying experience of the 2 week long (16 classes) summer quarter classes I am currently engaged in. In the very first class the 25 students who got 'F' in Basic Electronics voiced that the poor result was because they did not attend the classes regularly. Why did they do that? They said (i) the class size was huge 250+  and it was easy to go undetected, (ii) due to that size there was not much interaction and they did not enjoy the class (iii) they wanted to relax after grueling IIT-JEE preparation and (iv) they thought they could make up before the exam. I ensured that they attend all the classes of summer quarter so much so that I made cell phone call to two students who bunked the second class directly from the class room and it worked. Also ensured that the class remains interactive, students come to board and solve problem or debate over a solution.There was Nir.., a very shaky, not-so-confident student among them. He said that he developed some psy... problem too which made him fail. I was worried if I would be able to reach him. But he tried his best. And yesterday I was surprised when he answered in affirmative to a relatively difficult problem I placed before the class. Not only that, he walked quietly up to the board and solved it very neatly there. It was a great moment! I was so happy! I am proud of you, my boy.I'll end this post by mentioning another experience from this summer quarter class. A good number of students of this batch have the potential to become topper in their class but how much they negelected themselves to get an 'F' grade! For example, Sand..., Gau...D..., Piyu..., Roh..., Mon... had been quite impressive. It is equally true that in spite of my best effort some students are not matching it up by studying the subject for 1-2 hour at hostel. Summer quarter is a fast paced program and I am afraid that they may not perform well. Let's see ..."},
{"title": "Bidding Adieu", "date": "Saturday, May 24, 2008", "text": "\"Sir, I am leaving this evening at 8:30 p.m. I wanted to meet you before leaving the campus.\" Said Tej... yesterday afternoon. It was about 5:30 p.m. I have just returned to Institute after 12 day tour to Nainital, Kousani, Almora with my family (as soon as vacation began).\"Dear sir,I had come to meet you 3 days back but you were not there. I just wanted to inform you that I have completed my studies at IIT Kharagpur and am joining Princeton University next for my doctoral studies. I enjoyed interacting with you during my stay in the department. I hope we meet when I come during the convocation.\" The mail from Sree... was in my inbox.Also there were other students to say 'Good Bye' before leaving.There is no choice but to bid adieu every batch of students when they complete their tenure. It is always difficult to come in terms with the fact those faces, smiles will no longer be seen in campus. I'll miss those debates, fights - mostly ideological as depicted in several posts of this blog. But I have great faith in these young guns. And I firmly believe that the future can only be better. Friends, keep in touch. Let us all work together to build a strong and vibrant India!------- ------- -------- ------- --------I had long discussions with outgoing students yesterday so much so that I was worried if Tej... would miss his train. He didn't get an offer for PhD from US universities and that's why he is joining industry. He was not considering IITs as a place where he can do his doctoral work. This was unfortunate. And I took some time to explain him why IITs could also be a choice, mostly in tune with what I described in 3rd topic 'One for the outgoing students' of the post http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2008/04/many-into-one.html He agreed to reconsider his decision. I advised him to spend few years in industry before joining doctoral program and persuing a career in academics. This will help one (i) realize the gap between teaching and practice and (ii) become confident when he deals with industry people in an industrial project in his academic career. Tej... appeared serious to return to IITkgp as a faculty member after his PhD. So said Sour.. I am keeping my finger crossed.We discussed few other things too. I shared my experience in industry - what to expect and what not; the role of money in slection of career; how much money one needs; the reversal of role between money and happiness as means and end; trade-offs in life; peer pressure is to follow the tide but interestingly all great work were accomplished swimming against the tide etc. etc.Finally, I couldn't but say that for last few decades IITs are doing more harm to the country in certain sense than the good. It is swallowing the best brains of 100 crore population and turning them into high skilled labour. All superlative efforts by Indians in Science & Technology are in pre-IIT days though statistically, infrastructure, build-up wise we are now better placed. An young Indian now dreams to get into IIT and once he cracks IIT-JEE he considers that his job is done. He does not realize that it is just the beginning. That he is now in the land of opportunities. His job is to make the most of it. The hostel life, seniors (peer pressure) conditions him in such a manner that there are only two options in life - (i) to go abroad for higher studies and serve an US lab or (ii) to get a high salaried job. Do they read the biographies of great scientists, inventors? Do they fee that they can be one like them - one who can bring a sea change in the thought process of the community? Can we believe that we were short of genius for decades? Civilization wise we have evolved more than others. Statistically, we should have a greater ratio of them among us. And in all probability they have come to IITs. But what did we make of them? I narrated the following story from my book Principles of Communication Systems, 3rd Edition, Taub, Schilling & Saha from McGraw Hill India (Such story is there at the beginning of every chapter of that book so that the young generation starts dreaming and aims big) which I quote now before ending this post.------- ------- -------- -------- -------“Yesterday was my 21st birthday, at that age Newton and Pascal had already acquired many claims to immortality.” – thus wrote Fourier in one of his letter in 1789. Born of a tailor family as the ninth of twelve kids, he briefly served priesthood, was imprisoned for revolutionary activity but his love of mathematics continued. In 1807, his famous theory on Fourier series was published.\""},

I told you if you keep losing you have to bear with my long, boring msgs.... This is your punishment.... Many times I have made movies which don't do well.... When I'm doing them, of course, I don't know they won't do well.... The story is written by somebody else and I just do my bit as an actor. But I have a way of dealing with flop stories..., I try my best to keep my character in the film at a level that it makes a failed story also special for me....\"I enjoy the work.... I make jokes about the failure.... And, of course, feel awful about it too.... So, right now, all of us have become part of a failed script... A bad IPL script.... Let's try and keep our characters worthy of still looking back at this story and remembering it as a special story becos we all worked very hard at this....\"So, chin up and don't spoil yr character in the next two games.... Let's go out with a bang and not a whimper.... In films, we say u r only as good as yr last film.... So let's make the whole world know how good we r in the last (maybe not) two games...\"Also, do ignore all this bit about Dada, me and John having issues.... It's a normal thing in the world.... People like to hit you when u r down.... So, we will be hit.... No stress.... It will make us stronger.... The only way to avoid this is to win.... That's one of the reasons why everybody likes to be a winner....\"On the other hand, the beauty of failure is that it brings people together.... So, let's stick this out together.... You know me well enuff to know I am not the kind of owner who has issues with the team 'cos of losses... I am too much of a sport myself to get beaten by defeats.... Like you guys are.... Like Dada and John....\"I am still trying to understand the code of conduct expected of me at the matches of the IPL.... ICC... Etc.... After I understand it, I will decide whether to accept it or not.... Till such time, I will be with you guys at the hotel... in the meetings etc., but won't come for the matches.... So, please don't ever feel it is anything to do with us as a team....\"I am as dedicated to my Knights as I am to my kids.... Only, I won't be coming to the class room till the headmaster's rules are understood by me.... I am a bit anti-Establishment kind of a guy, so I apologise for this quirk to u all....

{"title": "Thanks!", "date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2008", "text": "It is time to say THANKS to all those who had been a big support to us. The list is endless. Still I'll try to put some pieces here together. I am excluding people who encouraged us a lot but with whom I have professional relation in IITkgp to avoid any misunderstanding.------- ------- -------I was hurrying past Deans' corridor when one final year student, T. Th... of another dept. stopped me. \"Sir, I read your blog\". I thought that he was referring to the post on final years. But he said - \"No, Sir, all of them ... the ones on social initiatives, too.\" The other day one quiet natured 3rd year student, Pra... Si... of our Dept. came to my office. After completing some official work he left to come back in a minute. \"Sir, your suggestion on putting up tube wells is good but isn't it better to provide education, job skill...\" Yes. It is. That suggestion was just to get started. Thank you, boys. Take some initiatives. Have something rolling. I also would like to thank a Kolkata NGO who are helping IITkgp students in some social initiatives. Through a student (who came to my office) they invited me in their 6th June convention on child rights at Kolkata. They wanted to put me in the list of dignitaries which I politely refused and expressed my interest to be a part of the delegates with other students.--------- ------------- ----------I was on my way to pick up my daughter studying in Class I from school. One senior Prof. from another Department of IITkgp whom I meet occasionally, crossed me in scooter, waved at me and asked me to stop my bike. I was surprised. Then he congratulated me, shook hands and said \"I have seen the TV programme. I am very happy and proud of you.\" It was so sudden and unexpected! Thank you Sir, I am honoured.-------- ------------- ----------I shared the development with McGraw Hill, India family with whom I am now working for the fourth title (expected release Dec. 2010). I have started working with them since 2004 in which three titles are published (my contribution as coauthor is approx. 350 pages each). They not only sent enthusiastic congratulatory mails but also placed the info. in two book websites of McGraw Hill Higher Education ( http://www.mhhe.com/leach/dpa6 and http://www.mhhe.com/taub/cs3e ). The very first button in these points to the 'press report' of one of the authors of the book (that is me) in the field of the research. This too was totally unexpected considering those were enginering text books. I consider this as a rare gesture on McGraw Hill, India's part and a great honour for me which I gratefully acknowledge. Thank you all in McGraw Hill, India, love you all.----------- ---------------- -------------My PhD supervisor, now in Boston, USA too sent a congratulatory mail but more importantly sent me few new ideas in a related area. He painstakingly explained them in an attachment which he was writing for me for few days. And the following is what I had to say before I took up the technical aspect of his proposal. \"Dear Sir, I always consider myself lucky in some sense! Never in my life I, that includes very much insecured childhood, I had any dearth of goodwill and support. There has been benovalence all around. I am grateful to all of them. And I am simply overhelmed to find how much time and effort you have given in explaining the idea. The simple fact that you were thinking about me in putting so many words is an humbling experience. And such gesture is just not one of a kind. So many times even after those PhD supervision days you have guided me and still guiding. Sir, I wish I could be a worthy student of you.\"--------- ------------ -----------My special thanks to Dr. P. S. Bha......, MD, DNBE, DM, a rare Kolkata physician with a love for research. Since, last one and half years he takes interest in our work and now he is one of us, an elder brother. He personally goes from one place to other to see that we are not short of funds in our research, talks to funding agencies, helps us in writing proposal. Not only that has funded INR 7 lakhs from his own for a new devlopmental work and is now helping us in hospital trial of the 'Heart Sound Analyzer' and its commercialization. This is also an overhelming experience and I fell humbled by this generosity.---------- ------------ -----------It was nice to receive congratulatory mail from Dr. Joy... Bha..., my friend, our collaborator in neuroscience area from university of London whose work was reported in BBC, ABC, Scientific Americana etc. He had been a great inspiration to us. I also thank Dr. Jai... Gos... of Schl..., Hous..., USA who too expressed lots of happiness at the devlopments. My mother's homeopath physician at Chuchura, Hooghly was very, very happy. In the second year of our developmental work he offered to buy then semifinished units at Rs. 10000 each and 10 such units. That was a great motivation for us that we were in the right direction. My thanks to Dr. C. S. Ba... of AIIMS, New Delhi who after a demonstration said that 20000 such units can immediately be sold as trainer units only and inspired us a lot. I am also thankfull to media correspondents who highlighted our work and definitely my institute, the great IIT Kharagpur and De.. (SR..) who always kept faith with us.--------- ---------- ----------Needless to say, my family had been a great support. My mother, wife, daughter were always accommodative and hardly complained about the extra hours I put in my work. My chhordi at Tata, Jamaibabu, their daughter (Tutu...), son-in-law (Ave..), Ave..'s parents were also very very happy and sent congratulatory messages. In Bandel, Bapidada, Boudi, Santudada, Rintu from Mamabari and Mejda, Chhotoboudi and others from bari telephoned. Pintu and Dip.. sent beautiful mails from USA.--------- ------------- ----------Endnote : Swami Satyabodhanandaji (Chiranjeev Maharaj), once every week sends one SMS, quoting Swami Vivekananda. This again is a great, great honour to be somewhere in the mind of Maharaj. I end this post by putting some of those SMS quotes, the last one first.1. The only way of getting our divine nature manifested is by helping others to do the same ... the poor, the downtrodden, the ignorant - let thes be your God.2. I love you all so much, but I would wish you all to die working for others ... Awake, Awake Great Ones! The world is burning with misery. Can you sleep?3. The poor, the low, the sinner in India have no friends, no help ... they sink lower and lower everyday ... it was the want of practical application, the want of sympathy - the want of heart. First bread, then religion."},
{"title": "Feedback Season", "date": "Monday, April 21, 2008", "text": "From 2nd Year StudentsCollected feedback from my UG theory students, compiled and uploaded it in my semi-official website. What I found, except for last 2-3 classes, students were happy. Sudden announcement of an unscheduled holiday and students' disinterest to attend two compensatory classes cramped me for room. I'll take care of such possibility in future. In the last class I got a chance to talk to them and asked to quantify in a scale of 10 considering all aspects like I am conservative in giving grades etc. They gave 8.5 out of 10. One from the teachers they have interacted so far in the dept. gets highest rating 9.5/10. Most of the rest gets 8.5/10. Among all the faculty members at Institute level they find three-four in the highest category i.e. 9.5/10.Two things come from this. One - I got to work hard to be in the highest league and Second - the teaching quality at IIT Kharagpur is great! Faculty members ka tempo high hai!!!--------------From 3rd Year StudentsHere after the lab viva were all over we could talk to last (in sequence) two students in the batch Ro... and Ay... More than the lab they gave a 360 degree review of life at IITkgp vis-a-vis academics. According to them IIT-JEE preparation sucks all the energy out of them before they step into the campus. Ro.... mentioned how a students starts preparation as early as clas VI or IX. For example, a student in Hyderabad Ramay.... attends 5:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m IIT-JEE coacing class then attends school and again in the eveing from 5:30 p.m. visits coaching centre. No time to relax, play - parents and seniors always pushing. Once they are in IITkgp, they are on their own in hostels with full freedom, net facility etc. The classroom are having 200+ students so attending class is not necessary as there is no personal interaction. And studying only for last 7-10 days before exam they can get a reasonable grade. So they decide to relax for a semester and then become serious which never happens. In the second year, in senior hall, the seniors preach them many different things except devotion towards study. They are told that the CGPA once in 6-7 or 7-8 bracket, it cannot be further improved and they should concentrate on other things. That's how most of them leaves the campus being simply average.Prof. R... however said that if there is class, it would be reflected in whatever one does. Probably, IIT-JEE is not able to pick up the class. Or the students are hell bent in trying to spoil themselves. I narrated one of my experience in gardening. A plant was transplanted to another better place but simply died inspite of watering etc. (though I don't claim to be a trained or skilled gardener) I felt bad and was thinking perhaps it would been better left in the previous place which was not as good. But with a guilt feeling I kept watering that dry plant. To my surprise, one day I found new sprouts are heading for room from that space, from that seed. And now there is a healthy, beautiful plant in place.-----------------From a 2nd year student (virtual)Yesterday I stumbled upon a blog of a second year student BE lab student V... K... who admits that he has become a blog addict. His first blog was a 'failure'. He writes, \"So,in the last days of 2007,I thought of giving one more chance-to move to my new blog,which you are reading now.Over 1 month has passed since then.I have bunked the classes,cut out from all the activities,spent a lot of time on the internet.\" He continues, \"all this time i was involved in this blogging stuff,stumbling upon to get new ideas when I got stuck,ate up the rest of my brain to fuel my blog.And what I got was just a single comment in 1 month.God,am I such a big looser?\"I decided to post a comment to one of his post which he believes none of his Prof.s are reading. As such, abusing Prof.s in the posts is his favourite time pass. Removing all the qualifiers - adjectives, adverbs and interjections, I could find in one post that he is hurt because I refused to sign his registration card in my office when I was discussing something with my research students and not during the appointed lab hour. Of course, he takes pride in bunking classes, faking sickness (he has uploaded a BCRoy prescription in his blog space where he feigned illness and the physician advised him rest), arranging proxies, lying that he was present in previous class, forging signatures of faculty members, cheating in exams. repetitively - even after disciplinary committee hearing and what not. The student considers that he is doing a great job by all these. He even uploaded image of his registration card and encircled four signatures that he claims he has forged.But if it was exactly what he says in his post as my refusal to sign his registration card was to harass him I think there is a communication gap. My intention definitely was not that. And I thought I should write a comment to his post, in spite of all the filths around, to clear the air. And this is what I wrote ---QUOTE--\"I am having no fear here,my Professor is not reading this\". If not one Prof., may be the other.I like your blog though you hardly have anything good to say about your Prof.s. You try to portray them in all negatives. Each one of us has both positives and negatives. If what gets reflected from you are only negatives, may be something is wrong with the reflector. I am not sure though how consistent you are in thinking \"i am an idiot\" as you mentioned in this post.I like your blog, probably because you are different, admirably so and sincere, sincere to whatever idea, good or bad, you are married to. Only you yourself or time can tell if your lifestyle or thinking is healthy or not. While trying to fool all others (Prof.s, fellow students - how you evaded responsibility in Kshitiz, parents..), if you are fooling yourself or not.I am sure this comment will invite a new post on your blog calling for my blood, stuffed with your choicest words 'f...' 'a....' etc. I already have one round of abuse in one of your post for not signing your registration card when you came to my office. If what you wrote in that post is the sole reason for not signing then I definitely deserve your ire. And I think it is never too late to say 'sorry' for what I did. But I don't remember the incident and I wonder how could I be so unreasonable! Going through your other posts I wonder if again it is an issue with the reflector surface or not.That's all for now. I sincerely wish and pray that you understand the value of your life and live to its fullest. Best of luck!--UNQUOTE--But from his Jan. 17, 2008 post I find he does not have faith in Prof.s or God but only in friends. I hope his friends read his posts or more particularly the one titled 'Feeling Blue' which is reproduced below for little greater visibility. I request his friends to come forward and address his issues. My best wishes.\"Snoozing late at night,waking up at afternoon,skipping classes,watching bundle of movies,mailing for long hours-are some of the things dominating me for the last few days.I just want to attend classes but my daily pathetic routine doesn’t allow me to do so.I always plan to do things in order to know in which order I’m not going to do so.Digging all the time in laptop will only add one more spectacle to the already loaded nose and ears.I neither like half of the lines of my hand nor can I give my belief in palmistry.Assignments and labs suck badly,classes look haunted.Nescafe has also increased rate,so less time there.Last year I used to love cycling a lot but this year,cycling sucks too.Even playing table tennis doesn’t fascinate me.I have changed a lot-I don’t miss my family and school-friends like others.I don’t have much happy memories of my life-Class IX to Class XII,these four years were the most terrible part of my life-a live nightmare.Even 6 months back,I had few setbacks in my life-God has not always been honest with me.Students in my class study hard-fighting badly for smart CGPA,I don’t know why?Only reason that I could figure out is to get an excellent placement.This IIT system sucks,don’t give you enough time to be creative.I have begun hating Professors-they have never been good to me. The only best part of my life at IIT is the friends that I have made here.\"---- A rejoinder on April 23rd evening ----The student was polite, by his standard, to react to my message but he was not ready to withdraw those demeaning materials stating that he has freedom to select content on his personal space. Endsem is on, hence I again reminded him gently if he should respect others' freedom and not use those filthy language in public space. Nothing emerged. Then I thought that that it best left to the people of his department (who interact more often with him) and more qualified persons in the administration to counsel him. And now I find those materials are deleted. I requested everybody and request it once more to have a mechanism at student level to address such issues. I hope the boy gets proper support. I wish and pray he gets the strength and courage to overcome this phase and develop healthy habits."},
{"title": "Instant Fame", "date": "Tuesday, April 15, 2008", "text": "Getting quite used to. The Telegraph carried it yesterday and Headlines Today (Aaj Talk group) aired it yesterday and the day before. A Bengali TV news channel may also visit. Need to be careful as lots of time are getting used up in interacting with media people. As such time is a scarce commodity. Today gave some bright idea to Aaj Talk reporters which is a win-win for technology developers as well as the channel. They will talk to the higher up and let me see if they can make use of it. One medical electronics co. representative is gathering information about the heart sound analyzer before they can make an offer. Let's see. Got a touchy mail from a father who wants the device for his son."},
{"title": "Three Bags Full", "date": "Friday, April 11, 2008", "text": "One for my family, friends and well-wishers There was a flurry of activities yesterday. In the morning, at about 10 a.m. came to know that a Bengali daily has given a lot of space (A4 size) to our invention in day's edition. My student Su.. had a talk with the reporter. They want to know more about other activities being pursued currently by our group to report them in future. We circulated copy of the newspaper article to many Prof.s, Lab. technicians in the Dept. Some came to us to collect a copy. It was a proud moment for all of us. Even De..(SR..) also wanted to have a copy. And of course, my family members too were very happy. As I mentioned in a previous post that my mother always dreamt that his son's name would appear in the newspaper. I was delighted to present the newspaper to her.As I was sharing the news with HOD and others, came a phone call. AajTak/HeadlinesToday, a national TV news channel is coming to IIT Khargpur in the second half to exclusively cover the invention. WOW! That's something! They came at 1:30 p.m. and stayed upto 4 p.m.. My first experience to talk to a microphone like that with news channel logo etc. My student, Su.. also told few things after some fumbling and cut, rewind on one occassion. We asked them to put our Lab. technicians too in the frame. They were very cordial, professionals with positive attitude. Then they came to my office, did some recording there and also the front of our dept. etc. After necessary editing, they may show it today in the TV. They too asked us to contact whenever we crack something new. I asked them if they would like to talk to any other person, say De.., HO.. or any senior people in the administration. They said that is not necessary. Today their Kolkata editor rang and said that the edited material is sent to Delhi for broadcasting, expected to be some time in the evening.Got lot of congratulatory phone calls, emails. The cardiology dept. Head of one very renowned Hospital rang (got input from Aaj Tak reporters), congratulated and inquired more about the product. My thanks to all our well wishers. We sincerely belive that by God's grace and your kind support we'll overcome many more innovation related challenges in future too.----------------------------------------------------------------------------One for my MasterYesterday will be remebered for few other reasons too. It was a last day as HO.. for Prof. D... and he is leaving IITkgp in a few months. In the morning, he came to my room and when he announced that we felt very nostalgic. A man with a heart of 24 carat gold, he worked hard for the department in a very passionate but unselfish way. Always aprroachable, a cool headed person, he led by examples. True, that I had many differences with him but I am happy to say that I was wrong in most of the occassions. But he was kind enough to allow others argue or place their views without inhibition and then explain why he did what he did.We moved out of the room and headed for Bha.. 's tea shop. Then he took me and R.. (another as.. pr..) to the courtyard at the back, the one he painstakingly built into a garden. Asked us to take care a few Bakul trees which he planted. It was very moving! In time to come, he expects the trees to provide natural shade in the form of a canopy. He expressed happiness that all the toilets are renovated. Then he took us to the new parking lot where some more things still need to be done. Called Pra.. (another as.. pr.. ) who is looking after that.He invited us to his Kolkata residence. I am sure he'll like our presence. And with Boudi present there one will always feel at home, pampered. He has some bright idea of certain future projects. Asked for our support. It will be an honour to be associated.In between, in his usual style he presnted us few words of wisdom. He equated life like climbing a hill. Though at a global scale the slope is positive, occassionally the climber need to climb down to overcome a ditch or so. Without that he cannot advance. One should not judge a person only by what he is at t=t and look for an average over some length of time. Similarly, positive slope at t=t does not necessarily mean that it is a uphill journey. Going downhill, one may come across a rock which he climbs not to maintain that positive slope throughout his journey. He gave an interesting example. There are 1000 families in a locality. 1000 TV, washing machine, house maid etc. Now each family had a divorce. It became 2000 families. So 2000 TV, washing machine, maids. The local economy boomed. But what is the overall picture? What happens to the kid? No wonder that Prof. is taking early retirement for her daughter who is now studying in Kolkata. And it is true that except the IIT in Kharagpur there are no options available for quality higher education. And almost no one from the campus makes into IIT!!! Why so? It may be discussed in some other posts.He also said - \"One cannot be both happy and great. A happy life is a set of few good compromises\". On another occassion he said that betweem 'dictatorship' and 'democracy' he prefers the later. Because though democracy makes more mistakes but it does not make big mistakes. Regarding IIT students' single point objective of having a better career he said that one does not learn till he experiences it himself. Very, very few can learn from observing others or analyzing things objectively. He gave example of Vivekananda. How could he do so much by the time he reached 39. He received great shocks from the world which can become unbelievably cruel. The rest Vivekananda learnt observing and analyzing.He went on saying. If you think of ten people around you, those ten people will think of you and you will have a great support system. How could one miss that? We'll really miss you, an elder brother in you, De..da in IITkgp. But definitely we'll remain in touch as Kolkata is not very far.---------------------------------------------------------------And one for the ...... outgoing studentsThe farewell function started late, past 7:30 p.m., may be due to lack of audience and as expected many things were cut short, the students' feedback etc. The skit was scrapped. However, we had synthesizer play from Prof. M... (piecewise continuous), Prof. S.. rendered a soulful Rabindrasangeet, Prof D.., H.. surprised everybody by singing a song. We never knew that he could also sing. And the student presentations though few, were of course qualitatively better than us. Ku.. spoke for a while about their social initiative. Few of the Prof.s gave inpiring speech. P..., the UG f.a. appeared not to enjoy much of the interactions he had with students. The high note with which he started fizzled out somewhere because the students did not reciprocate. The students however aprreciated his effort, project supervision etc. Then there was usual presentation of memento for all the outgoing students. Some students felt that the MTech students are missed out somewhere.The dinner was good. Found that the juniors (2nd year mostly) took the outgoing seniors' suggestion to 'enjoy life' in the right perspective. Then we had few photo sessions. I circulated two reminder pads to the outgoing students to write their next destination, email id, personal webpage and blogspace. Few filled up there itself. The rest, I expect will complete before they leave the campus.As people started leaving and it was past 11 p.m., like every other farewell evening of past few years I got engaged in some 'heart to heart' talk with some of the outgoing students. I raised two issues. One is about their social responsibility - how few tubewells in a village can make a huge difference. I wish they read my earlier post of 27th March http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2008/03/social-initiative-iitkgp.html and the discussion we had with Vinayak and Chiranjeev Maharaj http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2008/03/afternoon-with-vinayak-our-alumnus-and.htmlThe second issue was about removing peer pressure on the juniors by which they are driven in one direction only. This is not allowing the juniors to look beyond only a few options making invaluable loss to them as more promising opportunities remain unutilized. This is also keeping some of the research groups unfavourably positioned. I said few things from my Feb. post http://gskgp.blogspot.com/2008_02_01_archive.html The students argued that though there are better research opportunities available with other research groups but students folk one area as all the 'high' paying (They were missing the qualifier) jobs are from one area. Many of them do not take a job and go for higher studies but they want to play safe first by securing a position in a highly paid job. Fair enough! Indian Companies, Government or PSU jobs cannot match offers available at foreign shores or made by foriegn companies having foot prints in India. The scenario thus is pessimistic so far. May be an US recession can bring back few here. Or the new reservation policy may help in giving better access to the premier institutions like IITs to more students who will be rooted in India or serving Govt., PSUs, Indian Co.s . (It may not be out of place to mention that I, myself do not enjoy any reservation.) Also why no IIT BTech (even MTechs) opts for higher studies in IITs itself? There are many internationally known faculty members or research groups. We have a sizeable community of PhD scholars getting PhD degree from approx. 4 years of research through international journal (IEEE, Elseveir etc.) publications and one foreign expert examining the thesis. If without IIT BTech and MTech IIT research labs can do so much, how much more is expected if they chose to stay back? And there is no dearth of vacancies or anything like that. Some pass out students were complaining about the quality of research in IITs. That is grossly unfair. In spite of the best (IIT BTech), the second best (IIT MTech), the 3rd best (NIT BTechs), the fourth best (the best of pvt. engg. colleges getting good job offer) deserting us I believe we are putting reasonably good show with those research students who join us. Compare that with the manpower input of US university research labs. Let us swap the students and see who delivers what! I must also say that I am proud of my research students who in spite of their limitations work very hard and raise themselves so much in four years that their work get recognized. I salute their indomitable spirit. I salute their contribution to IIT research labs.I believe all is not bad with brain drain. It cannot be. In this world all of us are different shades of grey. No issue can be portrayed fully black or fully white (Image Processing people may differ). May be our country cannot house so many graduates. That IITians are leaving, there are rooms available for engineering graduates from other institutions; there is increasing requirement in Indian Industries to think global in terms of compensation, opportunities. Even Government made its intention clear in 6th pay commission. Also our alumni have brought many laurels for the country and paid back in uncertain terms. They helped in developing positive world opinion about India which benefits the country in some way. And today the global boundaries are more notional than anything else. My best wishes to the would be alumni. Have a very very successful and meaningful life ahead. Be courageous. Remember 'I' for India. If you find some additional space, say time/energy, please spend it for the less privileged section of our country. It will give you lots of satisfaction. And you will enjoy your life in true colour and spirit.Please keep in touch. Always feel free to drop a line or two, if not more. Wherever you feel like, contradict me and prove me wrong. Now onwards treat me not as a faculty member but simply a senior or your colleague in building the resurgent India.My best wishes to you all, our brand ambassador. Let you all understand the value of life and live to its fullest."},
{"title": "Thinking aloud", "date": "Sunday, April 6, 2008", "text": "“Will you write about this event?” – asked Sou.. I was reminded of my school days of diary writing. Often I used to spend hours on that. Several of my relatives who used to see me engaged would inquire – “Are you writing about me? Are you writing that I am having food now etc.?” Some used to get scared too. “Please, do not write this discussion in your diary.”Here some student asked, “Writing, where?” Sou… replied – “Sir writes a blog. One post on Gour… was quite popular.” Then he turned towards me. “Sir, the posts are very long. Can you not make it short and sweet?”The event in which we (few faculty members and students) worked together was concluded this evening with reasonable success. The dedication and the hard work put forward by the students in these two days as well as in the build up were unbelievable. There was no sign of fatigue or discontent at any point of time. It is always a pleasure to work with such a team. Hope, we’ll have the opportunity to team up again in future.I fully agree with Sou.. and I myself also like those posts in others’ blogs which are short and sweet. But if the blog name is to be justified i.e. random thoughts, bandwidth has to be wide. Also I guess, my presence on this topics in real-life are like short pulses of higher magnitudes. That warrants the transform domain presence which is virtual to be longer. A kind of uncertainty principle! Enough of justifying one's misdeeds!! I think I have written enough to qualify this as a new post and I should stop here.------------ The official post ends here --------------The unofficial guests are welcome in this space!What I write now is more of thinking aloud. It might create confusion, too. In my UG days at IITkgp there was one Prof. who was very strict but successful in making us learn something by posing hundreds of questions, answers to them were often contradictory. He used to say in every class, \"Confusions are welcome. That forces you think. You learn when you think.\"This evening in the dinner circle one tired student head of the event was lamenting that he is doing some project which is a mere repetition of a 2002 project work. Also the machine is faulty, beyond repair. Whatever result he is getting is not making any sense. Then he said that a student would love to do project work if it is meaningful or according to his choice. When I put few questions he admitted that (i) if the students are given the choice they will try to flock together to one place which is not sensible and (ii) the priority of a student is to work under a 'peaceful' Prof. than anything else.This makes me somewhat confused. And while coming back from the arena after two days of serious engagements few thoughts came to my mind. Why did the students work so hard? Was it all inspirational, selfless service? Was it because of the peer pressure i.e. juniors do not have any other options but to oblige senior students? Do they enjoy that? Then, why did the senior students take interest? Will they take same interest in another project and put forward by another faculty member or even for a family event? Are the students expecting something more than “Well done!” What is that? Are we faculty members aware of that? If aware, are we exploiting them in some form? Is it simple ‘Give and take’ policy? Or does it have a more idealistic flavour?Perhaps it is a mixture of both or the idealistic aspect may have more weightage. May be when they plunged into it they thought about certain issues which are more earthly. But at the conclusion of the event I think they gained an experience which is more than what they expected. Can we then say - it does not matter how one gets into a good work (i.e. pressure, benefit etc.) but the work, if good, will return more than what one was looking for. A sense of great satisfaction, scaling of new important verticals. Then if a faculty member puts some pressure it should not be construed as exploitation. As such IITians are smart enough to find an escape route if not interested.Let us get even. What if similar questions are addressed to me? There are few senior people in IIT whom I respect so much so that if they request some thing it is always an honour for me to oblige. I am not overdoing if I say that their wish is my order. I have that trust and confidence in them that they will not ask me to do what is not good or me. And the rest becomes simple and understandable."},
{"title": "Three + 1 Questions", "date": "Thursday, April 3, 2008", "text": "Yesterday afternoon was one of those which I always wanted to have as a student and later it turned out to be the one which I wanted to have as a teacher too, with every student batch of IIT, thanks to Prof. R… ‘s three questions and +1.The power went off at 10 a.m. due to a massive cable fault. The deadline of restoration was getting extended. Students in DS… Lab were having fun – no work. The suggestion of flash viva was not accepted citing lack of preparation or everybody pointing to Su…. to become the first sacrifice.To act as a filler (expecting power to come any moment) I sought suggestion on a real-life problem where people want to make quality drinking water available to remote villages in India. These are the places where water table is so low that tube wells are not a good proposition also there is no electricity. Students gave few interesting ideas. One is to have some sort of reservoir (concrete made) followed by filtration unit at the outlet. It is perhaps better than providing individual water filter which can be sold by head of the family, usually a male when in distress or to support his drinking or other habits. As we were discussing how to fill those reservoirs Prof. R.. returned after a very short and delayed (In IITs, life is like that. You are always pushed to the extreme!) lunch and the student in me got better of me. I was his student in my BTech days 20 years back. He asked us to continue. But …Then Prof. R.. asked the students to respond to these three questions one by one.1. What is your own dream for the future?2. Is there any societal pressure in the choice you will be exercising?3. Would you like to become an entrepreneur?For most of the students 1 and 2 were not in conflict. I find that little disturbing. Have the students started dreaming what society wants them to dream? Which society? Cannot anybody dare to be different? About 10 of the 26 students (mostly toppers) want to go for higher studies abroad (except one). Only one (Debd…) of them wants to come back to India and take a career in academics. Here, for some students the societal pressure is in the form of parents asking them to go for management education!!! That is interesting! However, for a hostellite and IITians societal pressure is more than what parents desire. Next option for many was to go for management studies. Direct job with good salary was also a choice for many. And few want to go for Indian Engineering Services. Entrepreneurship is not a choice, at least for now. What was heartening that almost all of them mentioned that they are aware of their social responsibilities and will definitely be associated with philanthropic activities. One (Riz…) aspires to open a chain of schools in underdeveloped areas. Others do not have specific projects in their mind but have definite intention to reach out to less privileged people and be at their side. It was so nice to listen to the conviction of Young India. I am proud of you, students. Love you all.To the skeptics, I would like to say, if these great minds spend even one percent of their time and energy towards nation building activity, reaching out to poor and destitute, it will do wonder for our country.I dream of an India where every child gets at least the basic amenities of life i.e. food, shelter, healthcare, education. Every child should have the right and opportunity to dream big, have joy of life. It worth more than a million if each of us can wipe tears off at least one person’s face and bring the smile back.I was not expecting that Prof. R… would ask myself to respond to those questions and as expected the students wanted to know the other side’s story. I was not prepared at all! However, it is a good question for one to be introspective at 40. There is still some time left to do what always one wanted to do, allows one to take stock of the situation and take corrective action, if any. But it also opens the flood gate of emotion. I said something, mostly about an NGO that influenced me a lot in my growing-up days or how much I want every IITian to give importance to his own career and consider that as capacity building to serve himself, his family as well as few less privileged countrymen, if not many.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What I did not tell that my upbringing was little different. My childhood, in some sense was living in a scary land. We, a family of five members were little better than those who do not get two square of meal a day. My father, who came from East Pakistan during partition as a refugee when in class VIII, (completed matriculation in India, couldn't study further and looked for one earning opportunity or the other) could afford to give only one set of dress every year that too used to be the school uniform. Another new dress I used to get from a relative during Durga Puja. The other dresses were the used ones collected from relatives. But my father did his best to support me in my study. I had to just name a book title, he instantly bought it from market (I took almost no private tution). He used to ask only one question – “Are you sure that you will read this?” I never dared to dream beyond doing well in the next examination. But my mother who even after getting double promotion at class V had to abandon studies, had a dream. She used to tell me – “Someday, I want to see your name in the newspaper.” It was fulfilled when I ranked among the top twenty in 10+2 board examination. Our whole locality burst into joy. Yes, I was a poster boy in our locality. I got lots of blessings and encouragement from every household. (My parents ensured that on every exam. day, before I left for the school, I touched feet of all the elders by visiting nearly 7-8 houses in the locality. One may wonder if that was a wastage of time during exam. days. But I never felt it like that. As such I used to study hard throughout the year. And during exam. only 2 hours in the evening and 1 hour in the morning. So had plenty of time. The otherwise chatterbox, I used to be very silent on exam days. However, there was no break in afternoon soccer practice. I was a soccer addict. Even if it rained heavily and there were few persons in the field with a football, one used to be me. School days, IIT days ... I never missed it. However, I made up for those two hours break in the afternoon by not wasting any opportunity of study. Even in a big 1 hour queue of collecting Kerosene oil (loadshedding was frequent, we three (myself and my two sisters) used to study in the evening surrounding one kerosene lamp) I usually had one note or one small book to study) Well, I was very happy to see the joy on my mother’s face when my name appeared in the newspaper. My father was always reserved. He did not allow me to attend felicitation functions, post 10+2 success, saying – it is nothing, you have a long way to go before felicitation etc. I believe he had a dream. I hadn’t. Later (after his expiry, when I was 24 years old) I found in his diary (my diary writing habit may have come from him - a matriculate, my father's composition of English in the diary was much better than me and that too in beautiful handwriting) that when I was only three years old he is writing – if nurtured properly, the boy has the potential to go very far. Anyway, the same year (1986) I ranked high both in medical entrance and IIT-JEE. My father wanted me to go for medical as he found it was a better way to serve the humanity. My mother wanted me to go for engineering for a reason which only a mother can think of. She thought that as a medical practitioner I was to be available 24x7 and thus would not get a good night sleep. I never studied late night but was an early riser. Actually, I used to be so tired after afternoon soccer play that it was hard to stay awake beyond 9 p.m. But I used to wake up in the morning at 5 a.m. or earlier. As I said before, I never thought beyond doing well in those exam.s and didn't have any dream as such, as far as career is concerned. I selected engineering because that allowed nearly zero shift in my coordinate, to stay in KGP only (I was not a campusite but from the otheside of KGP, called Golebazar), close to my lovely family. The IIT days were full of conflict. I was an off-beat Patelian. I had images of gods and goddesses in my room and I used to perform Puja every evening. I declined to give proxy for my batch-mate in NCC (EME), then 1st year also used to be together with seniors. But I survived the ridicule, opposition to reach the stage, one of acceptance. My SGPA was always more than 9, the final sem. being a perfect 10, ranked 3rd in the Dept. Going abroad was never on my agenda. I took a job in a nearby place TISCO, Jamshedpur. Turned down a generously offered PhD position by a Prof. in an East Coast university, a job at Standard Chartered Bank as the posting was Mumbai etc. In my 2nd year (1988) of IIT UG days, my father was diagnosed to have both the kidneys damaged, he survived for another four years. Throughout he led hero’s life, full of struggle, utmost honesty, selfless. It is easy to do great things in media glare when people are clapping. It is difficult to show greatness in small, small things in our day to day life that does not draw attention. The effort he had given to bring his children up was unparallel. He too used to wake up at 5 a.m. or earlier, take morning walk and Yoga, then visit bazar(market) and/or help mother in cooking - chopping vegetables/fish etc. (sparing children who were engaged in study) so that food is ready before we leave for school or he leaves for job. Returning, in the evening, he used to supervise and actively help us in our study. He turned down promotion offer many times that would require him spending more time in his job and less time for us. We had severe crisis of water in our locality. Almost every evening, sometimes in the morning too, he had to bring water from a well of nearby Masjid, 100-150m away. He was reluctant to take children's help though I forcefully accompanied him sometimes. He or my mother never thought about entertainment like going to movies or having one television etc. Their entire joy was in watching us grow, the real-life characters and not reel-life characters. When in class X, I was supposed to write one paragraph in school on ‘My Favourite Hero’. Everybody except me picked up character from History. I wrote, “My father is my favourite hero …”. The class teacher called my father and showed the copy to him. But he was very strict, didn't show any emotion, never, no - only once, in his death bed, two days before he died. He called me and told me to be realistic, careful, ...... He was a true soldier in the battlefield of this samsara. Lot of people of various age groups, including some of my school friends, yes, school friends and not their parents, used to come to him for advice, suggestions. In his funeral procession to burning ghat, there were hundreds of people. The body was to be kept in a playground for some time. It was about 2 p.m. Some of the teachers in nearby school were surprised when their students asked them to grant leave so that they could also join the procession.Tulsidas says - Tulsi, jab jag me ayo, jag hase tum roye. Aisi korni kar chalo ki, tum hase, jag roye (Tulsi, when you were born, you cried and everybody was happy. Lead a life such that when you leave, everybody cries and you are happy.)"},
{"title": "Social initiatives & IITkgp", "date": "Thursday, March 27, 2008", "text": "So many good things are happening! It is difficult not to take a note of it.In the morning got a phone call. My ex-student Sid...- IIT, IIM, now MNC executive (Cadbury, gave lots of chocolates to my daughter. I am helping myself with some as I write this post) posted in Mumbai is on a KGP visit and there would be a get together in the evening. The last time we met was his marriage (the bride, Piy.. too was my student, she also works in Mumbai) and there were lot of stories to share. We three had a nice adda and besides many things we discussed how feasible is the idea if one batch of say 70 students from one branch of a IIT (say, IITkgp ECE) after passing out adopts one village in India. If not any other thing, helps to put few tubewells in one village, as many villages as yet do not have proper drinking water facility. Then it can be scaled up creating health, education and employment opportunities. In a batch of 70 students there must be at least one student who will have direct or indirect contact of such a village and there will be some working in India (even if most go abroad) and keep a track of the development. Others can take responsibilities of communicating to people, private trust or Government agencies who matter. Also one can help in donating themselves or collecting donations, visiting the village once a year and inspiring, motivating people who are doing field work. The aim is to turn it into a model village in 5-10 years. Thereafter, if they want the batch can take up another village. The good thing about this model is it can be scaled up easily and it has a cascading snow-ball like effect. From IITkgp itself, with 1000 students intake one may expect at least 10 new villages being adopted, cared each year. Think what will happen after 10 years and if other IITs, IIMs, NITs etc... too join. It will have a demonstrational effect and give a message to the public that the IITians also pay back. Though the public at large have high regard for IITians but somewhere in there mind they feel that we are selfish and it is easy to find there exists enormous negative sentiment from public statements made in different media. Sid... said if the executions are done properly the students will come forward e.g. their batch of IIM students donated approx. Rs. 3.5 lakhs for the underprivileged from the institute caution money returned to them. I said that since the focus will be on one village and there are NGOs of repute, the execution part can be worked out. Also the IIT, IIM students are smart enough to devise something new or can start a debate which will definitely lead a way. First of all what is needed in a batch passing out is the conviction that we can and we will do something together.The day before yesterday stumbled on a notice posted by JAGRUTI, a social initiative at IITkgp calling all the different groups working in the campus for social causes. The aim is to develop awareness, exchange ideas and of course, creation of an organized platform. Their public post at http://www.jagruti-kgp.blogspot.com/ said \"There are at least nine social initiatives currently operating in Kharagpur under various names. However there is not much awareness about any of them in the Campus. While many people might be willing to help out with such projects, often they don't come into contact with the right people at the right time. As a result, most initiatives die out in the initial phases due to lack of work-force and excessive load placed on a few people.\"To be honest, I didn't know that there were so many initiatives. We at http://vsc.iitkgp.googlepages.com/ were contemplating that we should start some activity to give members an opportunity to convert some of the theoretical things to practice, else our own training is not complete. Som... with some members has already started exploring some nearby underdeveloped areas. As soon as I saw the notice, I sent a message to VSC mailgroup if few members can attend the meet. Sai.., Kan.. and myself were there from VSC and approx. 50 students and few faculty members. I was so happy! We have had many occasions before where eminent speakers enlightened us on our social responsibilities. This is the first time I saw a student initiative of that scale aiming for sustainable developmental work. More interesting was the presence of one representative of a NGO, PRAJAK who are working together with Railway Police for upliftment of Railway platform kids. The lady, working in an MNC came all the way from Kolkata to support and encourage the activity. Wish we too had that spirit and that level of dedication!JAGRUTI convenor narrated their experience on working with Rickshawpullers in the form of Rs. 100 a month saving at P.O. It worked well for few months but the student got busy with study and other things, followed by a lean season (student vacationing, not enough business) and drinking habits, that made them defaulters. Emphasis was then shifted to lady members of the family. A group is formed with them. The pickle making gave them some profit but it was not scalable. Now they are trying Sal leaf plate making. But raw material procurement as well as selling are to be done by students which is a tall task. Also 8 of the 9 member team will be passing out this year. Sustainability is an issue. They requested students to join them and their vision going forward is to have chapters of JAGRUTI at IITs, NITs etc. To end they showed a moving video (now in their blogspace) they have prepared to spread awareness.Then the SAMBHAB (mostly 2nd year students) spokesman said how they have started their work in a different village. Paper bag ('Thonga') making is what they are advocating. There too, selling is their responsibility.Then PRAJAK representative spoke. She was happy to be proven wrong - once she observed that IITians does not care for social upliftment and do not shoulder any responsibility.The third year ECE student Ku..  of Gopali Youth Welfare Society (GYWS) explained their work. Theirs is a registered Society at Gopali, 4 km from IITkgp campus. It appeared their work has matured a lot and they are starting an English medium school there, totally free of cost, to make children from backward area more competitive. They are collecting donations for the upcoming school. They agreed to help JAGRUTI if there is a shortage of manpower in their work.Then spoke representative from KADAM that just started its journey. Representaive of other team were either not present or didn't spoke. Then the floor was open and Professors were asked to give their comments. One Prof. inquired why JAGRUTI failed to get new volunteers from junior batch, why so many organizations if GYWS is doing so well or if there is any ideological difference. The answer given was lack of awareness and there is no ideological difference as such. One student asked why they want to promote JAGRUTI as the common platform. The answer was, call it XYZ, call it 'Technolgy Social Initiative' under Gymkhana etc. Another question asked to GYWS was why not volunteers give some labour and earn money (through coaching affluent students) instead of collecting donations. The answer was - it remains an option but there are many difficulties to do that, mostly in the form of long term commitments required or students' desire to part with hard earned money. One comp. sc. senior students observed that since IIT students' strength is in academics they should do BTech projects which directly helps society at a large.  He is part of a national initiative that shoots video to highlight the needs and promote awareness.I congratulated all the groups for the starts they have made. In responding to some questions they sometimes appeared defensive or apologetic. I requested them not to be so. They are doing good work but it can be done in a better, more organized manner, considering where our strength lies (some sort of SWOT analysis). I requested JAGRUTI members to be more careful in selecting a project. It may be a learning experience for them but the lives that are affected may lose faith by repeated failures. The volunteers should do sufficient homework and also get trained in organizations (in Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore ...; in Kolkata, our alumnus started PARIVAAR http://www.parivaar.org/ can provide useful training) in the weekends or in  vacations who already have great experience. Regarding common platform, I suggested 2-3 executive members of each team can sit together and chalk it out. It is for the executives of a group to decided whether to retain their identity or merge with someone. Merging should be a natural process and not forced. One should also address why the teams are around batchmates and why across the batch there is a noticeable communication gap. How the dynamics work.Of course, one should lead by examples, one needs to take a stand. Our own lives should be exemplary. Without that it will be difficult to motivate, draw younger people. I know one IIT BTech in late eighties Patel Hall who refused to give proxy for his batchmate because it was unethical nd was ridiculed like anything in the mess and so many other things. But he stuck to his stand - Ask me any other help, but not this. Later his room at B 1st East used to be considered as temple and there was a handmade poster in his room quoting Vivekananda - \"God helps those who do not help themselves\".I may be wrong, but I personally feel - ideology is an issue. Why we do, what we do. It will help us to rise above confusion and conflict which are so common in working for a common cause. It is to be clearly understood that we gain more by helping others (How is it so?), when we give (i.e. Daan) if it is not accompanied by respect (i.e. Maan) from our side it does not yield result, what is the strength of an organized work and what is organiztional discipline (Is it regimental?), how important is to stay away from politics, how important is to involve local youth etc. All these require deliberations of some kind and take leaves from lives and teachings of great social workers. I am happy that the organizers finally decided to meet at a regular interval. I believe there will be much bigger effect if all the groups work together but the model should be such that none feels constrained.Finally,  the caution ahead. (i) It is said - Fame is the last infirmity of noble mind. A social worker should ask periodically, what for he or she is into it and be honest about himself or herself. (ii) There should be proper time management so that the academics do not suffer. The seniors who inspired me a lot in my student days used to say categorically - If your academic performance is poor it will harm our work. People will say that the boy is spoiled by the seniors in the name of social work and that will send a negative message.Be assured of our (the faculty members) commitment to help such initiatives. In our Dept. I know at least 5 faculty members are directly involved in such work at different places and in different capacities. Everybody would love to support initiatives of our own IIT students which is sincere, serious, non-political and for the good of many (the students themselves as well as the underprivileged people who gives the opportunity to serve). Our best wishes to you all. Please keep us updated about your work."},
{"title": "“Abar se asichhe firia” (He has come back, again!)", "date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2008", "text": "The childhood of a Bengalee is incomplete without reading Sukumar Roy. Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Se’(He) and Pupedidi (a kid named Pupe) doesn’t come even close to Roy’s Ha-Ja-Ba-Ra-La (some alphabets in Bengali), Jhalapala (a play on a teacher, taught and …), Lakkhaner Shaktishel (a play on Ramayana from a different angle) or Pagla Dashu (The eccentric boy, Dashu). If you have a Bengalee friend and a kid in you, you may try some of Sukumar Roy. I assure you that you won’t go disappointed.If you think I am trying to promote Bengali literature which of course has a very wide audience and a Nobel, you are off the mark. I beg excuse, of course, for this rather long introduction to non-Bengalee readers, if any :( but when I started to write this post postponing my self-styled exile, the title quote of eccentric Dashu of my childhood favourite (even now) Sukumar Roy came to my mind. Dashu through a series of bizarre incidents got a chance to act in a play. He was playing the character of an angel. After one scene, he was supposed to go back to heaven and his role ends there. Unhappy to be away from the limelight, Dashu gate-crashed few scenes later with the above quote that the angel has returned from the heaven. This was not in the script and all the characters were dumbfounded. Dashu had a sharp memory. He remembered others’ dialogues too and spoke on other’s behalf ending the play in a hilarious note.But this post may be on issues more serious than above. (Resemblance if any, is with me and Dashu :) and not the issues) The exile is postponed by a week or so. As such in the first three days of this new week, I was always on my running shoes, not knowing when and where I’ll take the lunch or a bath! But I learnt something in the process and also there were 5+1 discussions in my office and lab. with students of various levels 1st year UG, 2nd year UG, 3rd year UG, MS students etc. I think all these deserve a post and I may have few points there for your consideration.It is always great to hear good things about our students from employers, mentors who supervised and assessed their work.Two weeks back we had an opportunity to visit a new steel plant where two of our graduate students (2006 and 2007 Meta…) have really proved themselves. The persons they are reporting to were full of praise. The students also were enjoying, took us around the plant and were well received by the shop-floor guys. (Personally speaking, my confidence in meeting the target deliverables has increased quite a lot by their presence in that big consultancy project.)Yesterday and today I heard a lot of praise from Prof.s of one US university where our 3rd year students go as intern and spend eight weeks or so. They work really hard and produce excellent output even in that short period of time. Then one visiting Prof. asked that disturbing question – Your undergraduate research must also be excellent, isn’t it? With so many good students and facilities available, I guess it is so.I didn’t attempt to give an answer. But it gives me a food for thought. Is our undergraduate research in line with the potential we have in IIT system? I am afraid the answer is – No. There is some good work done by a few with good publication etc. but that is more of an exception than the rule. Why is it like that? It is easy to start a blame game. Students may say – there are not enough exciting problems to work on, not all the faculty members are approachable (for various reasons – disinterested, does not guarantee ‘EX’ etc.), the approachable faculty members are overburdened with too many students and have no time for discussions etc.What does the faculty member say? I cannot speak on behalf of all the faculty members. (Who am I to do that?) I can express only what I feel citing few examples.- A week or so back we (myself and another faculty) called a student representative in our lab and asked him why the students in general are so casual about study. It is becoming monotonous and painful for us to scold students every week. The student representative very politely said that (i) in March the students are not expected to study because of Gymkhana election, Dramatics and other extra curricular activity – the faculty members should ‘take it easy’ (ii) the IIT students are not lazy or indifferent. They work hard, for 12-14 hours a day when they go for internship (iii) the job is what only matters and IIT brand is sufficient for most of the students and (iv) once in IIT they don’t need to work hard as one can ‘get away’ with putting small/medium effort.My reaction to above was – by this approach you are devaluing IIT brand and there is a time lag when brand dilution comes to surface. It does not matter to you because by that time you will be gone but your subsequent batches and we who remain with the system will feel the heat. A decade back, it was considered that the IIT students are the best. Few years back it became ‘the best student from a non-IIT engg. College is better than the worst from IIT’. Now employers think ‘the better students from a non-IIT engg. College is better than the worse students from IIT’. Thus the gap is narrowing. Why? On point (iv) I am reminded of a small story we were told when we were kids. A boy was brought up by his aunt. Since, the parents were not there, the aunt used to try to be very affectionate. In the process, she overlooked many of his follies and the boy used to get away with lying, stealing etc. The boy grew up and became a hardened criminal. Once caught, he was put to rigorous imprisonment. The aunt now old, lamenting, went to see him in jail. And at that time the grown up boy insulted the aunt profusely and told why the aunt didn’t scold and stop him when he was young. Then he could lead a life honour. Now, even if released, he will be seen as one who is back from jail and his life is sealed.- If that was the story of mid CGPA students, this is one for a high CGPA student. The other day, De..(…) was lamenting that one good student applied for an internship in a foreign university, his host is decided, stipend too is assured. Now the boy senses that a new internship opportunity may be there in another university. The boy asked the De.. if this one offers a stipend few hundred USD more then he is keen to change his option. The De..(…) appears to have stated that stipend part is not yet decided. The boy wanted assurance on higher stipend before he changes option.My reaction is – Is this the mindset of a good researcher? Few hundred bucks this side or that side, does it matter? What about the commitment to the earlier university faculty who wanted to host? Usually the stipend is enough to support oneself. Should it be the criteria of exercising one’s option?- In another scene, the students soon after being given the offer letter (they were careful, I guess, not to do it before -why I say that - in recent past, another group of students timed their complaint about a faculty member only after the grades were out - Disclaimer: the faculty complaint part was as told to me by a senior faculty and I had no personal exposure) for internship by a visiting faculty team from a US university started pleading if the stipend can be increased from USD 3000 to USD 3500. One member of the visiting team remarked aside that they were expecting the students will be asking questions on research opportunities, environments etc. The stipend is decided on some formula from the fund that is available and considers what is sufficient for the student to support himself there and not to be considered as an earning opportunity. If stipend is raised, they have to take less number of students and it might not be acceptable to the students themselves and also to the donor of the fund who want more number of IIT students to have an opportunity to visit good US universities. Also such things are not decided in the corridor by begging, pleading.My reaction is – Do our top students need to do that before Institute guests? I also want to ask this. Does it have anything to do with the expectation building from students pleading and getting more marks and higher grades for different subjects in IIT (The other day, TAs - MTech PhD students who are mostly BTech from non-IIT engg. colleges were laughing how IIT UG students try, try and try to raise even one mark if possible by pleading for hours/days/often weeks)? I request not to take these comments personally (In our Patel Hall days it was said - when we say, we don't mean it, when we don't say, we mean it. I am not elaborating - say what?) as personally I am a great fan of the most vociferous of the group pleading before visiting Prof.s from his BTDS days, I still remember his role in Bengali play 'Muktadhara' (one girl also did a fantastic job there). And I myself also asked for moneteary benefits in terms of discounts while procuring database for our group, sometimes in hundreds of Euros and sometimes in thousands of USD. However I said, (i) if they have a policy to give discount and (ii) if not, can we offer some service to them, say, developing Indian database which they can sell to others and recover whatever discounts they give to us. Believe me it worked, and also my suggestion was included in the annual review of one EU body.Money is important. But it is not more important than many things. The other day few UG 1st year and 2nd year students came to meet me. Apparently, they were keen to work with our group. We had burnt our fingers once in trying to develop a team around such young people. Last year, one fac. from M.. dept. came to my office and said that he wanted to offer money to four 2nd year E.. students to work in his project. And insisted that I should tell the students to do so as they earlier expressed interest to work with us. I told him that it is better left to the students to work wherever they like. But I believed and still believe they should not simultaneously work at many places. Then the work gets diluted. The fac… mem.. at Prof. level (I am still an Asst. Prof., the bottom most level, no hard feelings though :( I feel it is better if other asks why not a higher position than why :), yes, 'grapes are sour.') was very angry and annoyed and since then stopped talking to me . I don’t want to comment on what those students did as the issue in this para here is to look into another dimension of money available in UG research. Anyway, I told those 1st and 2nd year students that there may be money with many faculty members/groups. Shouldn’t they want to explore those first as we don’t offer any money (neither we guarantee good grade, we have a relatively high benchmark)? Money can have many a use – application to foreign universities, reducing burden of parents or it may be simply fun. Look at your priority. And the students said they should explore if money can be made out of UG research.I would ask the reader to take the first part of above paragraph as criticism but the second part is mere statement of facts. It should not be misunderstood that where there is money, there is no research output. Neither its converse is true. If a student gets an opportunity to earn some money and get good research output, what is wrong with that? Nothing, from the student point of view. But, if money is the priority, you need to be careful if you are compromising somewhere with the research goal. This is because of the fact that the fund given is often not to get a high innovative component (which requires patience, perseverence) but for some time bound output, even with low innovative component where bricks and mortars are innovation of others. (I tell my M.S., PhD students funded from project that the priority is project deliverables on given timelines. If you can get a thesis out of it and get a degree I'll be happy but you are paid by the sponsor to deliver them something in a given time that works.) Also going after money one tend to ignore other promising areas where there is no money to give to UG students. And I believe for a significant number of IIT UG students money cannot be the priority. I don’t know if I am wrong.- Industry representative from Ana.. De.. in a meeting says (two days back, seconded by another Industry representative) that they employ a IIT student not for the fact that they know how to handle certain tools. That can be taught in seven days by inviting an engineer from the tool supplying company. They want from the IIT students domain knowledge (like Signal Processing, Curve Fitting, Minimization etc.) and problem solving ability. This is what is available in IIT and not elsewhere. In tea break, I asked that person – Can you come to our Dept. and talk to our students? I believe there is a misconception or proper information not reaching proper place. (In this connection, I would like to propose a student journalist programme. Student journalists from each Dept. will be responsible to cover major events, specially the ones where outsiders come and this can be put up in an electronic student magazine) He said – I would love to.The first example of a student representative speaking in a lab took place in D… Signal Processing Lab.I think the above is enough to highlight my points why quality is missing. To put it simply, we are not aspiring for quality as yet. Given the talents we have in our students, we definitely can achieve quality research output and that too in good number.One member of a 3rd year student group I was talking to this afternoon asked how should one go about to get quality UG research output. It appeared that the question was sincere, also I have a high regard for the student who asked that question. After returning from office I was wondering if I should address that or do something for which I have already committed and by delaying more the pressure will further increase (Received a mail today that asks me after my 2008-2009 commitments are done to commit 2010 and 2011 for two works and that mail “is to keep you informed in advance so that you may plan activities at your end appropriately.”). But as I said, the question appeared sincere and that’s why this long post for my young friends. To answer to his question I would say - The specific things can be told by the faculty members or group leaders of the group you join. But from my own experience I would tend to suggest the following in general.1. Select an area being pursued in IIT where there is innovation related challenges, as early as possible. There are lots of information available nowadays. If it offers money, consider that as icing on the cake. But, don’t miss the cake.2. Select a faculty member or a research group in that area. Don’t commit anything. Say, out of your own interest, you want to read some background paper – Review, Tutorial kind. Read them carefully.3. See if that area excites you or not. If not, repeat step 1 and 2 till you zero on one. This may take 3-4 months time. The exercise is worth doing as you get to know many different areas and often cross-fertilization gives quality research output.4. Once your area is selected, browse last 5 years publications in IEEE and Elsivier to find out the current trend. Try to narrow down on 2-3 problems in this area. Talk to your group leader/faculty member. He may give 1-2 more choices too in which their group is currently investigating. Take some time, take a closer look at all the options and select one. It may take a month or so. The 1-2-3-4 may be completed in one semester.5. If you have started early then you might not have done necessary courses required for quality research in this area. Now you have to take the group leader into confidence and assure him of your long term interest and commitment to the group. He may formulate a training program for you : theoretical and experimental with some start-up code.6. In parallel, take print of last 5 years papers from good journals around that problem. Use pencil to underline important lines. (Papers in good journals explain proposed method beautifully. If something they use are work of others, they may briefly touch it but will definitely give a reference. Find out that paper from reference section. Read the relevant portion.) In the margin of every page write in short what is ‘Aha..’ factor i.e. appears great, a sort of revelations to you and what is ‘Uhh..’ factor i.e. appears as weakness to you. In my last visit abroad one senior faculty of a reputed US university was telling that the research students should actively study philosophy, logic. Then they will be able to find weakness in the argument of others and also build his own argument properly when he writes a paper. Every paper, however good, has weakness. Else research in that direction would have stopped at least by the authors of that paper. That does not happen.7. Done diligently step 5-6 may take almost a semester. This is called literature survey. This is very important for quality research. (I know one person from a reputed research lab of IIT who once told me how much effort he had given to bring one innovation in his design. I asked what about communicating it to a journal. He said he is not sure if some other group has already designed in that manner before as he did not do proper literature survey. What is this boss? This is not professionalism!) During this time, also try to replicate the result of at least 2-3 good recent papers. You may wonder what is its use. Besides getting a feel of the problem, the code/result will be required for comparison when you yourself propose something new later.8. Steps 1-7 may take a year or so. But you now have a proper launch pad. In a 4 year program if you have started at the end of 2nd year, you still have one year left. If you start earlier or in Dual Degree programme you have additional time. In any case, the talented among you are well poised to take it to the next level. And the rest becomes specific to that group.9. Please keep in touch with your group head. Attend all group meetings. If you are into too many things, you will miss some of them. At least, once every fortnight discuss your progress, make a presentation.10. This I told before but want to tell again. Please avoid probabilistic research. That is to remain engaged with 2-3 groups hoping at least one will click or you'll get reco. from many different faculty members. (Strong reco. citing your achievements, publication, journal communicated etc. from 1 or 2 is sufficient for what you usually look for) It dilutes every one of them. However smart you may be, it is not easy to concentrate on 2-3 problems simultaneously and go deep. You are also free to tell if we faculty members do probabilistic research. If 10 good students work with me definitely 2-3 will generate good output and I am not worried if I do not get 10 good outputs. True, the teaching load here is too much (The US Prof.s say that to do proper research, it should be 2 class per week, maximum 3, ours is average 10 and there is lot of non-teaching responsibilities too), number of students per faculty is increasing at a fast rate and one cannot blame if we cannot give sufficient time to all the students. (The other day my student Bi.., after I missed three appointments because of urgent meetings got things clarified from me in google chat during 10:30-11:00 p.m.) Also I would like the students to consider how much time we devote to our profession, to make the wheel running. To give you an example, for me, it is 14-15 hours a day on average.11. Don’t use black box approach. That is not quality research. Don’t try to fool the supervisor and in turn yourself. If you have not done anything for a week tell that plain and simple. Don’t speak trash. Don’t worry about scolding or grades. The other day one UG student came to explain me his 7-10 days work. He was trying to pass through slides in a jet speed. In the very first slide after title slide he wrote 5-6 lines. I asked him to explain one simple sentence. He was simply stuck there. It is 1:15 a.m. As I write this blog I find that student is online. Hope he is preparing for the FRI presentation he himself rescheduled. Another point! After that project review meeting, his google catch line showed the following for a brief period - It is difficult to bluff confidently if a Prof. is there at the other side of the table :)12. Don’t be afraid of failures. As I wrote elsewhere “To start with, don't count successes and failures. It is far more useful to fail with some technique but to be able to tell why it failed than to succeed with another but not to know why it worked. ”Negating a hypothesis, that is to say, it won’t work is far more difficult. Still, if you try, you may find there could be something (modifications etc.) for which it can still work. There you are! That is something new! Everything counts if you are sincere and meticulous.At the end, my apology if the post portrays anybody (including me) in a poor light. This is only to be seen in reference to the issue being discussed - our attitude towards quality reserach. I am sure people know how good we (IIT UG students, I am one of them) all are and such posts should show the new thinking going around to do even better at a larger scale (not limited to few toppers). I specially like and admire extracurricular activities of IIT students. Few years back I used to attend all BTDS productions. Now it is a bit difficult ... but I am almost regular in a weekly study circle where students are overhelming majority.My best wishes to all of you! Believe me, research is much more exciting than money or grade. And in the long run, it pays you more even in those two terms. Purity (of thought, approach), Patience, Perseverence are the key. Spend 2+ years of quality time (don't simply hang on, in our small lab we have matresses for students to have 1-2 hour nap while working overnight, that kind of attitude). I am sure UG research will do wonder.Now I hope, I have earned a break from this blog space and can have some time for myself now, to devote to many pressing things. You are welcome to send your view on this blog to my gmail id. May be such a long post with some cartoons would qualify as a IIIE paper (new forum of other kind, inspired by IEEE - just joking!).All the best! See you again later.Rejoinder : The following is excerpts from Kriti's new post at http://ptblanc.blogspot.com/  Kriti, now in PhD program in the Dept. of Biomedical Engineering at Virginia Tech, worked with our group for his BTP, did reasonably good work, got one mid level journal publication, had all the potential to do much better but ............. well, something can be found from this.“You think you got into the team because of your abilities? Think again. The list was made by us and sent to the Gymkhana.”“I always told you that this guy (referring to me) was not up to it. We should never have put his name on the list.”“You cannot leave the post just because you want to. The Hall gave you the post... and you better live up to the name of the Hall.”“We don’t tolerate any attitude. If we say so, not a single person in the Hall will talk to you. How would you like that?”“If you can’t do it, quit. People will curse you for a few days and then they will forget it.”“Your first priority is academics, you say? Then why the hell did you take up the post? I had warned you earlier...”“Kid, I believe in you. You can do it.”---The first year in the Senior Hostel was a confusing and trying one. My extra-curricular ambitions had overlapped with the political ambitions of the Hall. And both of these bulldozed any academics ambitions that I might have had.And the post goes on ......"},

This is to say that the time and energy available (or created) after the routine stuff to be devoted to something big I am aiming for. The infrastructure has considerably improved (don't count the cracks in every room or termite, frogs, reptiles, insects - our cohabitat in the quarter) compared to the first major work I took up in 2004 in a 1BR flat that I got after joining. The dining cum drawing space was my study as well as bedroom for my mother. How often I disturbed her sleep working past midnight in my PC. Like every other mother she was more concerned about me, my health rather than her own and always encouraged. Now we are in a 3BR acco., with a separate study for myself. Net connection has also improved! Time to set a new challenge. 2009 October is one such deadline for a major goal which will be a test of fire. Also there are few semi-major goals to achieve at different points of 2008 and 2009. It requires me to be calm, collected and my concentration level need to be few dB higher.I try to believe in “If you give, give your all”, a kind of all or none law, when comes to matter of heart, matter of choice (you may find that from the posts made here). Intensity comes from remaining focussed. Hence, as a new week begins tomorrow, it is time to sign off from this blog space and few other extra academic engagements (Dept. society is one of them) for the time being.

When I was like you (I am nearly double in age) I was much more boring and not as multi faceted as you are now. If I visit your homepage, orkut space or read google catch line, I find that what is on surface is only one-twelfth of you and eleven-twelfth is under water. You are much more than what you present before us. The only thing that haunts me – with such a potential like yours, does our country deserve to be where it is now? Can we not do something together – think big, dream big and then execute it with professional expertise?

{"title": "What a week!", "date": "Saturday, March 15, 2008", "text": "What a week! After a tumultuous week that preceded before (undue stress at office, spilling it over to my family, forcing me to send a kind of SOS to my friends, batch-mates, seniors, ex-students that perhaps it is time to rethink about IITkgp) it was a great, great relief! And what a way to end, few hour back Su... gave me a ring. Our paper in a leading Elsi.. journal got accepted in full. The joy is all the more because this is the output of one of the two new research teams I started building up in two new areas after joining IITkgp. Now that the gestation period is over, this will give a shot in the arm of our speech group which was lagging little behind the biomedical group in terms of quality international journal publications.But the turnaround was initiated by Vinayak and Chiranjeev Maharaj’s visit (previous post), subsequent reading of ‘Inspired Talks’ from abridged edition of Vivekananda’s complete works and inspirational replies/telephone call from friends. Also I got whole hearted support from my two senior colleagues with whom I shared the problems. I am very grateful to them. But for them it would have been much more miserable! I am sure more support would have come but I didn’t want to talk to others on a request to contain the issue and giving it time to resolve by itself. I believe that was the right thing to do in larger interest though mental duress was almost unbearable. Anyway, that is a matter of past and life always says – Move on.Coming back to the week that it was -(i) the classes went very well, covered lots of ground in theory as one student termed it ‘heavy duty’, the other spending more time on this subject in the daily schedule he mails to me; I will be on time to finish the syllabi.(ii) played my small role in tech. tr. gr. of students and April workshop where one of our invention HSA will be showcased.(iii) MO... signing and receipt of 1st year’s funding from a renowned physician who besides providing clinical facility, hospital trial is also funding our new three year long research project towards a new innovative product for a 50 percent ownership of the would be IP. It is a significant amount of funding and coming from a person (and not usual funding agencies) for a futuristic product shows the confidence he has on our team. We feel honoured and it is a great morale booster for us. The outcome of two sponsored projects we finished in a different area were also very highly rated by the two funding agencies - DST and ISRO.(iv) received lot of accolades for whatever small work I did for big interdisciplinary IITkgp team looking into a multidimensional problem; the team leader who was not known to me even a month back (I was included in the team by another senior member of a different department. In that dept. I took some classes 3 years back which was received very well by the students) now places lot of confidence in me.(v) my team members prepared two slides to give an overview of our group’s work in two areas for Adv.. VL.. Con... presentation which was termed ‘too good’ by any standard. Our involvement there is through a kind of invited project which too generated lot of confidence in our young team and faith in our work.(vi) received royalty cheque, quite a significant amount of money :) from General Manager of a publishing house who few weeks back commented \"I sincerely appreciate your dedication towards every single project you take up. Working with you has been a great honor and a learning experience in several ways\" at the beginning of my new project with them. I would say, it is an honor and fulfilling experience for me to receive such comments from the leading most technical book publisher of the country.(vii) had interaction with three different groups (two inside campus, one outside) on how are they working towards social upliftments and their need; had discussions with students who are not yet in any of them but are interested; also I was humbled to receive a telephone call from Chiranjeev Maharaj of Belur Math.When I was thinking that there are seven wonder-ful reasons to feel great about the week that gone by, got the telephone call from Su.. this morning, the icing(for an academician) on the cake, the elsi… paper. As I end this post I recollect and try not to forget what Vinayak told as his favourite from Vivekananda - “Manifest your divinity (i.e. good qualities) and everything around will be harmoniously arranged for you.”A rejoinder being added on 21st March, 2008 : Sa…, the PhD student of Biomedical group, rang at about 8:30 p.m. Visited ‘Author Centre’ of a Elsi.. journal having impact factor more than the one where our speech group’s work got accepted one week back. Our work is ‘Accepted with minor modification’. If it is a fight like this, to excel one another, great to be a part of that. Wish both the speech group and biomedical group scale newer heights!"},
{"title": "An afternoon with Vinayak, our alumnus and Chiranjeev Maharaj", "date": "Friday, March 7, 2008", "text": "Vinayak (our alumnus from Mining Engg., MBA from IIM Kolkata, founder of Parivaar – http://www.parivaar.org/) as always, was soft spoken and spoke little. He narrated how he started Parivaar, an home for homeless, mostly girl children, the most vulnerable in our society (which we call civilized) from his private tution money in his IIM days with moral, physical and some financial support from fellow students, lots of them were ex-IITians. It was difficult days with no donation coming from anywhere. But he and his team had a resolve. And within 5 years their conviction percolated to the masses so that fund is no longer an issue. He is invited to open centre at various parts of the country e.g. IPL famous Deccan Chronicle is trying their best to have branch of Parivaar in Hyderabad. In Parivaar, every volunteer is called ‘sevabrati’. What is seva? Vinayak said that it is not crores of rupees you spend on others but more to do with a state of mind which should come to one when he meets another in the form of “What can I do for you?” Money etc. is secondary. If one has that feeling he is sevabrati and is a part of Parivaar. The most important ‘take home’ point for me from Vinayak’s talk was what he considers as his guiding light from Vivekananda – “Manifest your divinity and everything around will be harmoniously arranged for you.”Swami Satyabodhanandaji (Chiranjeev Maharaj), true to his name was more incisive and didn’t believe in sugar coating what is satya –truth. That we have decided not to see, face, understand what is truth for our own convenience as ignorance is bliss. Truth may trouble us at least in the beginning. Truth asks us to get rid of our inertia. Truth asks us to sacrifice lower things for higher. What happens if we do not face Truth? We deceive ourselves, suffer, repent. What is Truth? Truth is that even today people in our neighbourhood die of hunger, kids do not get education, crores do not have medical facility. In any other civilized country if one is so poor, other would have rushed to offer food and cloth because it is a shame for that country when a person dies of hunger. We spend 50 lakhs – crores to buy a flat in Bangalore, a fraction of that could give 50 families some shelter. Does it ever come to our mind?Maharaj narrated a story that can be linked to the hypocrisy we, the so called learned indulge in. A king once announced that whoever can teach him the art of making 'Jilipi' (a kind of sweet liked in Bengal) he will be offered half the kingdom and hands of his daughter. As it was being announced everywhere, the queen also heard it. Anxious, she called the king and asked if he knew the consequence of his announcement that half his kingdom will be gone etc. King was unperturbed and asked the queen not to worry. Queen said - Why should I not worry? King replied - It is because I won't learn however best one tries and thus the kingdom will be saved. The queen, surprised, asked - Why then do such stuff? The king said that it is to get some fun from monotony of life. We may feel perplexed to hear such a logic but isn't it also applicable to many of us? We have heard, read, discussed and debated many noble things, came across lives and teachings of great men but we have decided not to learn and reflect the same in our life. It is enough to consider this as an intellectual exercise and not to attach any more importance than that. Why then do we do such stuff? There you are! The king of the story in us! It gives us some sort of fun, kick. How much we hear the sufferings of our fellow men but we have decided not to feel perturbed as if we have no responsibility at all!Maharaj was in IIT in his return journey from Amlashole, a place in West Midnapore district, 2 hour drive from IITkgp which recently became known for wrong reason – death due to poverty. Shabar tribes living in hills have no access to basic amenities of life – even food is not available everyday and thus they, even the little children have to fast. Education, healthcare are distant dreams. Maharaj, Vinayak and some volunteers are starting an initiative there.Maharaj continued. Truth is that we are selfish. Truth is that spirituality, concept of God is very simple. We make it complex because we do not want to understand it. Who is spiritual? The one who thinks that what is his due is also due of others. Who is God? The one who thinks of only what is due of others and does not worry about his own due.Spiritual theories are burdensome. Still if one tries to reason one can find there is one. Why do we love to tell IIT alumni is big and not small? Why we want to have more? More money, more property …? What is the limit? There is none. Why? Because we are infinite. How do we say that? Take a fish out of water, it wants to go back. The finite I in me wants to get back that infinite status and thus the insatiable desire to grow. Extending this logic, in ultimate analysis, there is no other self. It is me only. Till he is happy I cannot be happy and that is the Truth – however hard we try to hypnotize ourselves and forget our real nature. The thought of losing individuality frightens us. But don’t we experience it everyday? In deep sleep – can I identify whether I am an IIT student or a Caltech student or even so basic individual attributes like whether I am a male or female? Individuality and ego comes hand in hand. The one who pushes ‘I’ factor has a trouble within. How? Look at our body parts. The knee lets us know that it is there when it has a problem. Similarly the throat, heart, lungs etc. Till that time we hardly recognize that they are there. If we are doing fine and not creating trouble, our ego will be less and we will work in a quiet, diligent manner.Maharaj highlighted few other issues like a beggar cannot be happy. And one need not beg in the street to prove that. He mentioned that he was told by a company top executive how a high salaried IIT grad once begged for a US position in his company and looked completely distressed simply because he was placed in India. He narrated one interesting SMS he received few days back. God was asked – What surprises you most in mankind? God answered – That first they lose health to get money and then they lose money to get health (There were few more lines which I couldn’t write in my running note) that is to say if the destination is 5 feet away we go 15 feet foward and then retreat 10 feet. Why not think of having a 5 feet course right in the first place? Same is true in our journey of life. Where do we want to reach? What is being sacrificed and at whose altar?Maharaj said that the education is different from information gathering. It is development of character and an all round personality and this only gives a person the highest satisfaction in life. Maharaj read one paragraph from Vivekananda’s writing where he called a person traitor who does not think of his fellow men. He narrated how social awareness and social service is an integral part of some US universities and 15 students of one US university will be visiting India soon to work in underdeveloped area as a part of curricular program. He praised Islam as the most practical religion for the majority as most of us need to be forced to make a move. In Islam, one must share minimum 2.5 percent of his earnings with poor people who may be a distant relative in poverty or some neighbour etc. Maharaj though of Hindu faith practised Islam too, offering Namaz etc. once he found in his hostel (at Ramakrishna Mission, Belgharia) there are three Muslim boys. Maharaj requested people to give back to the society. Depending upon broadness of heart one should take care of at least parents, then relatives, local people, countrymen etc. in increasing order of capacity.Maharaj expressed great hope and sees an important role of IITians in nation building exercise. He requested people to do something for others, even if it is little to start with and not merely think. He wanted the campus study circle (http://vsc.iitkgp.googlepages.com/) to be an initiative of the students where faculty members will come as a support and not the other way.(Disclaimer : The above is as it appeared to me. Misconceptions, faults, if any, should be attributed to my own misunderstanding and not to Vinayak or Maharaj.)"},
{"title": "In the same boat ... looking other way", "date": "Friday, February 22, 2008", "text": "The other day Pra.., Sya.. and Vai... visited my office regarding web hosting of Dept. Soc. I was recollecting some of the blogs of the IITians I visited in recent times. I was refering to them Kriti's May 24, 2007 post titled 'Happy Sad' at http://ptblanc.blogspot.com/ and few others. They sat patiently giving an ear to issues, beyond their agenda hardly uttering a word, perhaps fearing it would make the discussion even longer. As they left I thought I should read these three individual's blogs to know what is occupying their mind these days. Just a curiosity! I couldn't locate any blog for Vai.. and Sya..'s one was all hi-tech. I have read Pra..'s blog before, his obsession with low CGPA. This time I could see his frustration regarding B.Tech. project allotment held few weeks back and how easily I could relate it to my frustration over the same issue. Yes, we are in the same boat .... but, unfortunately, not looking at each other!!Let me explain how it is though we belong to two different ends of the spectrum. Pra.. is unhappy because he didn't get the faculty member to work with due to his poor CGPA. The BTP allotment here is strictly on the basis of CGPA, the choice is entirely given to students and not to faculty members. Also there is no first round, second round business. The advantage of this - perhaps it is better than any other method to support 'meritocracy'. The disadvantage - perhaps is in the form of two self-sustaining vicious cycles. The toppers work in a particular area, with particular faculty - does better work that draws attention and also get better grade. This attracts toppers of next batch to that area and that particular faculty member creating a self sustaining cycle of excellence. One can imagine what happens to the area or the faculty members where students join because they have no other option (due to lower CGPA), demotivated and in general (exceptions aside) they do not like academics or do not want to work hard ... with mind alreay pivoted elsewhere. Poor work output, poor grade (my two current final year students didn't get time to meet me after registration, after two emails one on 5th Feb. and next on 20th Feb. with the threat of deregistration they came to my office yesterday only to say that they will begin project work after mid-sem exam.) and next year we have disinterested bottomers, left with no option, flocking this arena. And this leads to non-uniform growth in area of research or faculty members competing with each other to get better students in their group in a manner which everybody cannot follow.I belong to the second group. The area in which I work may not be interesting, as a person I may not be exciting, ... And, one can find from this tone there is something common between the feelings of both ... frustrations, failures... One, not being able to work with the faculty member he would have liked, the other not being able to work with the students he would have liked. IIT provides many a opportunities. It is not for the students to think about uniform growth and other broader aspects. They stay here for a short span and are well within their rights to do whatever they consider are best for their careers. My best wishes to them. We, the faculty members are here for longer tenure and our perspectives are different. The students are here to exploit the system while our job is to manage (create, sustain values) the system.It is irony that the miserables do get a chance to meet. I regret not allowing some people in the Saturday extra classes on signal processing and pattern recognition. Again it was CGPA that stopped me. I was worried if those students don't do well in exam I would have to explain somewhere why I had given indirect extra load to students who otherwise are finding it difficult. It was a mistake. The entire thing! And this year we backed out from a rerun of that training programme (with current 2nd year) once we saw the BTP allotment list. No point being hyperactive! IIT system provides options to faculty members too. Let the time and energy be devoted to more useful things.I would like to end this post in a note which may be surprisingly positive. (1) Even with so called bottomers our group generated output which is comparable, if not better compared to some of the groups where toppers join. Healthy competition! We have not run off the field! (2) This year initially I was allotted three students with CGPA 7.0x, 5.8x, 5.3x respectively from the bottom 10 of a 51 strong batch of which one was moved to some other faculty member (after strong persuation of Prof.-in-Charge, my logic was - I understand that better groups will get better students, but isn't it responsibility of better groups to accept some not-so-good students and make virtues out of them, why all the responsibility on us etc.). The two students when met me for the first time were asked if they want to work on a problem which is (i) easy and considerable work has already been done by our group till date or (ii) a new, challenging problem. They without hesitation selected (ii)."},
{"title": "Ch. Maharaj in campus", "date": "Wednesday, September 5, 2007", "text": "Got a telephone call from SMu at about 12 noon, the day before yesterday...that Ch. Maharaj is coming to IIT campus at 3-3:30 pm. Will stay for one hour or so. Our alumnus Vin. of www.parivaar.org and a team is accompanying. He is interested to talk to all study circle members. The time was short. Still there was a good gathering. JS was out of station. But many others came. We had discussion in dept. seminar room. Maharaj was very very inspiring.Some of the points that comes to my mind now are :1. We often complain that we don't have sufficient time to look within-It is like that wood cutter who need to work entire day with his blunt axe to amass certain amount of wood for his living and thus has no time to sharpen it.2. The difference between an intelligent and meditative mind-Intelligence : to be able to focus outside, meditative mind can focus inside which is very impportant specially after one attains the age 25-26, faces failures or unexpected turn of events which in most of the cases unavoidable.3. On rat race, career : There is no competition - each one is runnig in his own track. We will get slower if our attention diverts o other track. Best if we have that faith - I am what God wants to make out of me.4. Our role is to introduce Swami Vivekananda to newcomers. Rest will be done by Swamiji himself.5. We need to start with Swamiji as Sri Ramakrishna is too simple to understand. Sri Ramakrishna was careful enough to give different prescription to different kind of people with different level of preparedness. Swamiji is straight forward. Speaks what is right without inhibition.6. Sri Ramakrishna - sutra, Ma Sarada- demonstration, Swamiji - bhasya.7. Need activity to keep young people engaged. Field trip is a good option.8. Should have closed door discussions with young monks visiting the campus rather than discussions in open forum with large gatherings.In the evening we had study circle at SBh's residence from 7 to 8 pm. SMu explained few things with nice examples. I tried to focus on practical, implementation aspect and consciously remove theoretical overtone of the erstwhile discussion."}
