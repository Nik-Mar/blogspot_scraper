{"title": "Dealer digs and a far out sky", "date": "Thursday, February 1, 2024", "text": "Waiting in the Subaru dealership/fix it place today.  Dog friendly, selling dog merch and making dogs feel at home with a bed , a bowl and a biscuit. Spacious and shiny, comfy leather chairs, for sitting on, to watch the Nat. Geo channel  or  to read  the rather decent books provided. There are no magazines.This waiting area is certainly a step up from any other. Coffee and tea and an assortment of snacks available.Comfortable! There is also piped in music, a great channel of tunes we know and love, Bruce, the Stones, Elton, and a variety of Mo Town. Dang, I could live here!The first program  watched was about archaeologists wandering around the ghost town of Virginia City and the findings of what has been left by ghost Chinese workers from  back in the mining days. There appeared to be opium. What I would not give for a time machine...The landscape looks like my old Wyoming home without the 80 MPH wind. Sunshine,  open blue sky, sage. Montana Beautiful.The next program was most interesting, Morgan Freeman wandering the earth looking for the history of god starting with the Dionysis cult in Italy. Of course , like all religions, it is male based. Women only existing to bring pleasure to the penis heads. He moved rather quickly from that one to Japan and on to Nepal to see how Buddha was invented- there again, all male. Bowing and chanting to their man god.From there he went to the oldest mosque in the world, and a Jewish temple, men  of course. Rules are strict, women are controlled, god wants it that way...if you are female, god hates you. Morgan did not make it any further into his quest because my car was ready and I had to give the man some money. There is an entire room for children, surrounded by sound proof glass and a hefty door. Cool toys and activities provided. Plus they have a  first American display on the walls. Some thought and caring went into this show room/waiting area/ garage. \"Buy a Subaru- the dykemobile of choice for  the thinking, caring  person that you are\". I will be sad when we can no longer contribute to the disaster of climate change. No petrol, no car. I am just as selfish as the next guy. Dennis will save the world, he claims- so no worries, I guess that I can relax. When I came home the sky was doing a thing! Thank you, sky!"},
{"title": "Alice Mackler, Boris dim bulb, trolls and a pooch", "date": "Tuesday, January 30, 2024", "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaZfku0dnGo&t=2s&ab_channel=openDemocracyComplications from covid 19 have taken many \"elderly\" folks to be sure. Boris ( heartless dim bulb with not an ounce of intelligence under that white blond straw wig) reckoned it to be nature's way of eliminating the old folks to make room for the young to \"get on with it\".Excuse me, Mr. Brainiac, Those over 85 years old, who died of covid represent 2% of the population. Deaths of 50 year old folks has been 19.2 %. Of course ages 75-84, have been  higher 26.2% , apples and oranges really. Anyway , all of this leads to Alice Mackler, who has died at age 92 from complications of covid 19.  She  had been painting since the fifties but was not known, really, She liked to glue collages and mess around. In her eighties she had a stroke  which did not dampen her creative urges. She turned to clay and sculpture. Her sculptures , are love-able \"Mr. Bill-ish\", exaggerated mouths, wide eyed  expression. Delightful. She has been the Belle of the art world  in her over the hill years. Hello Boris...what have you offered the world in your  youthful  59 years of taking up space on this planet other than nonsensical hot air?  Ageism is an ism  detrimental to society, we have been through the wars, political shenanigans , fighting the man, bringing  women's rights to the fore, raising healthy children in spite  of  heartaches, challenges, school yard bullies , video games and Cost Co pizza. We know stuff and have honed skills.  At this point in life, we have pretty much run out of fucks to give. Kuddos to women like Alice, and to women unafraid, unintimidated, judged for not being silent \"nice\", for falling out of  line , for adding to the lark and joy of life in the generally horrid human condition. Thank you! Seeking  or leaning on approval is futile, crippling and demeaning. Like Alice , take it to the workshop or the kitchen or the garden or where ever your light shines. Be your true creative self, wear socks that only come half way up , loafers, comfortable clothes ,most certainly mismatched. Wear a hat. This lovely time of being elderly is yours, all yours- \"Git offa my lawn!\" R-E-S-P-E-C-T, sock it to me or fuck off. -0-Ok then, that brings me to Norwegian trolls, my favorite group of so called \"mythical\" creatures. If you go to Norway, and I advise that you do- look for Trolls  everywhere in nature.  I have a screen saver, a photo I took while in between  the fjords and farms, taken from a bus that took us up a winding road. I had never noticed until last night that the mountain held a Troll who went out in the sunlight one day and became stone forever. (trolls should  never go out in sunlight, consequences!) Now I can not unsee him! I showed him to Ernie, She came over for the first time since I have been back,  looking for a buffalo biscuit. Also running from the law as she was found wandering  the street  below us earlier and reported on \"Neighborhood\"...They took her photo and tried to get her to go with them, she is old- not stupid!! She knows that she will never run out of buffalo biscuits as long as we are alive. Her human came over to take her home saying it does not matter what she eats these days, as they are numbered. That's the thing about beloved dog gods, they age out before we do.  I think of Olga and my heart breaks in its knowing.  Eat buffalo biscuits, make art, say your favorite words often, (fuck off), or a sweeter version - \"sod off\" or \"run along, now\"...Niceties do not pack a punch or feel legit falling out of my mouth. \"Fuck off\" is far more satisfying, but y'all are nicer than I.  If I said \"va te faire foutre\" would any English speaker be offended? Nope,  it is the same vulgar insult but who in America understands French- all contrivances right? We deem some  word as bad even though they are  made of the same letters of the alphabet as  the nice words. I guess it is like baking  cakes- using the same ingredients  but one is burnt."},

All is right and well in our little world. The yard is a lake, frisky plants are loving it!Nothing very interesting, just the old tried and true. The old comfortable shoe. PNW dark wet slosh. Glad to be back.Spider saga has continued only because I am stubborn and reluctant to contribute to Spider delinquency.  He slapped me with a fee for a \"decorator\" and Painter to deal with his wall, the one he climbs to get around the flat...The one that I marred so egregiously with invisible marks. Anyway he charged me $200.00 . I only paid the estimate that I got which did not include a bloody \"decorator\" . Air bnb got involved and determined that Spider should be compensated the full amount, So my disagreement  is with them now. They will just charge my card for the difference I suppose. I did send them an earfull/eyefull. and I did leave an honest review. Of course Spider said that none of it was true and that I was being childish blah blah - expected from such a guy. We know him. It feels so great to have tried my best to be a real human, an honest human, yay ME!! But Spider continues to be a dick and airbnb continues to keep him as one of their \"BEST\" hosts- so it goes.  Air BNB , never again.  Never take anything for granted- trust your gut if  it feels a little bit  \"ewww \" when booking a stay somewhere. I had that feeling right out of the chute but argued with myself: great location, great reviews, 4.5 months is not that long if I don't like it....Remind me to never argue with myself!Dennis and I went out to Cost Co the other day. I made an appointment to get my ears checked to see if I will need aids sometime sooner rather than later. All of my friends have hearing issues and it is annoying, What? Did you say \"Anna Ling?\" What\". I do not want to be one of those, I am all in for a hearing trumpet. Cost Co cracked me up especially having just come from tiny land. The massive carts  utterly dwarf humans , it's like  walking around in a cartoon.  Massive jars and bags of food  look like some sort of funky giant art installation.  Typically American over the top shop!  More  and bigger must be better! I have an appointment in February. What? Did you say \"feed the hairy?\" What?  \"brew fairy?\" What? Huh?  Whut? One of my going deaf friends actually told me that there was nothing wrong with her hearing, that  she could not understand people anymore because they have  forgotten how to talk- they mumble in whispers really fast... How's that for denial?"},

The awkward stage , neither here nor there.Last night the sun slanted across the horizon , casting winter light on the hill and the sky showed a crack! This is promising, next week we may have temperatures into the high fifties!   My sister in law sent four \"Scrub Mommy\" sponges and a jar opener  for Christmas. Both excellent gifts, though one Scrub mommy only lasts for two weeks before deterioration, being all organic and  environmentally correct. I am not sure about them yet. Four dollars apiece seems pricey for two weeks use. The jar opener is brilliant. Not clear on the brand, it is unmarked, but if you see something like this floating around in a thing shop you might want to pick it up. I think it could remove the top of a VW bug no problem.  It makes me feel mighty!My automobile is still frozen to the ground so I have been puttering around the house doing nothing important. The usual, laundry, dish wash, sorting ...I did put my printers box up with some tinies in each little section. Treasures like spent bullets, the plastic head of Beetlejuice, tiny rubber dog. I bought the box in Covent Garden from the box man who has been selling them for years and years but is running out of these cool ancient  ones with the brass corners. This one is the largest of my lot and my last.The Fed X truck just got stuck in the icy slush in front of the house. Two inches from sliding into Dennis's car! It was like watching jello wrestling- the driver finally figured out how to go backwards at an angle- no one was hurt. I am still waiting to hear from airbnb resolution. Not holding my breath, it will be what it will be."},
{"title": "three AM wander, dropping out, snowed in", "date": "Friday, January 19, 2024", "text": "3:00 AM, the hour that my eyes fly open and I wander around the house. Through the window you may barely see the snowman keeping vigil through the  freezing night, with a snow chair beside him, used by no one. Keeping the fairy lights on throughout the rest of the winter keeps  illusion of \"special times\" and celebration alive. I have kept them up for three years because undoing them is tedious and futile really. When off, like in summer, the wires and bulbs blend in with the wall. Un noticeable, seasonal darkness forgotten, sunshine takes over, lights take a backseat. This is their time to shine.I managed to get all of the Dungeness shingle packed in my carry-on, heavy AF but there you go. My last lot of stones from the shore of the North Sea, a fabulous memory of Sarah and Andy and one of my favorite beaches. I will be giving one of them, one with a hole through on a cord, to Flora Jane when I see her. Pretty sure she will not remember me. The girl loves rocks, so that will get me in her good graces again, maybe.I gave the little girls next door a bag full of British doo dahs, which they opened this morning. They have been playing in the snow for three days, rolling around , tumbling, building , squealing and sledding. Utter joy!Birds and raccoons well fed, Peg, the one   legged gull,  has come as well. I gave her salmon skin but it had frozen to the paper plate. As hard as she shook it ,it still would not shake free, she gave up. I think that bandits stole it away in the night. Peg lost that one.  This morning I found a  bogus charge from paypal for nearly $800.00.I tried to contact them but of course there are no humans there,  Dennis called the credit card folks to block payment, they complied, and then I dumped my Paypal account all together. Since I am not using my Etsy shop anymore there is no need for Paypal, other than the convenience of just a click to buy online stuff that I do not need.Dennis and I agree that less online presence is probably a good thing. Less dependence on mobile phone is also a good thing though they have made slaves of us, as predicted. Most obvious in London where a mobile phone rules everyone's lives. It's all changed so quickly. I am not a fan of the trend nor of the vulnerability and hassle involved with being mobile phone/ internet tethered. London is utterly dependent on tech so when the satellites are obscured from perturbations in the ionosphere, or space shenanigans by  ill intent, the city will shut down. I am sure that it will not be the only city crippled. We still have a landline! How 20th century of us! AND a ham radio, Dennis is an operator, over? Copy that!I am crossing things off- like air bnb, Paypal, Etsy, facebook, Instagram, slowly getting back to immediacy and reality. I feel more empowered dropping out. Like the good old days. Mr. Tech, you are not the boss of me!!Jet lag & time zones, are the boss of me at the moment, and being snowed in.  The refrigerator is stark. rummaging around in the back of the cupboards, finding old ramen... yeah, that'll do.Clearly my car is not going to the grocery store any time soon...."},

The ride over the Atlantic was fabulous, brand new airbus flying first class Delta, spoiled forevermore! The only way to fly, look for deals, you will not be sorry. Delta is on the upswing, hiring, building, buying new air busses - flying first class is a dream!Years ago Stella and I flew Delta to Italy. That was when the airline hit the skids and was nothing more than a bucket in the sky with broken seats and a broken toilet which allowed contents to run down the aisle. “ never again!”….reluctantly I bought round trip this time knowing that the new CEO was a firecracker, getting the company back to the should- oughta -be’s. Success! So, f you must fly I recommend Delta now, who knows how long this good thing will last? Snowman being born , taken from window with my mini iPad. I was looking forward to my real computer and my real camera but over the last four 1/2 months it has been messed with. Nothing works. Trying to iron out the wrinkles is tedious and a right challenge for this person lacking tech skills. I do get email though. A demand of  $200.00 from Spider-Man through air bnb to paint the wall. I sent 75.00, which he contested. Now Airbnb is involved. I sent a letter to them , did not hold back , provided photos and hearsay from Inga the cleaner and Becca , the neighbor . Concern for his mental health and his abuse made it pretty clear that he should not offer his flat anymore on Airbnb. I may hear back from them , stay tuned….Just to refresh memory , this is the $200.00 “damage”.A sort of find Waldo  exercise . It is really good to be home. Everything works, the water is good, the heat is on, cozy. The added plus of chubby snow is just what the generous cosmos ordered. It’s a beautiful day. If I can get my computer back in working condition, I won’t be using my mini iPad anymore. Upon my return I found the best thing ever! A fruit cake. All the way from Mary’s oven in the land of sunshine. I ate half of it before I crashed into my own lovely bed- the other half of it nibbled through the day. I have heard that if you are really good and don’t do murders or jaywalk, when you die you will go to the heaven place that only serves Mary’s fruit cake, breakfast ,lunch, and dinner! I want to go there. I am being good….."},

The neighbor declared him mentally ill, the cleaner declared him mentally ill AND an asshole. They were very sympathetic and felt sorry that I endured such insane abuse. For about three hours I thought about spider as a victim of mental illness, so complex and misunderstood…after speaking with neighbor and Inga, compassion took a back seat. Now, in my mind , he is just “ assholey”. Inga told me that when I close the door in the morning on my way, to never give him another thought. Thank you, and yes, validation from people who know him  worked wonders. All’s  well that ends well-ish… see you in the winter!"},

Probably goodbye for the rest of my life so I made the most of it. I spent about five hours , taking my time to examine art.  My idea of the very best way to spend a day.I get all goosebumpy approaching the Tate from the bridge, the sort of excitement one feels when going home , if “home” is the best place on earth! There are a few Blake’s in a room next to an artist inspired by Blake- compare and contrast sort of set up. Really, they are not at all comparable. Can’t beat Blake! So much fabulous art, you will just have to take a trip yourself to see it up close…you can almost smell the paint…intoxicating.I walked across the bridge, sun still shining. Miraculously flowers are still doing well . Back before dark , I went in to a few charity shops , I got a couple of little things for Flora. The shop nearest me has just undergone a face lift, it has become fancy , unaffordable and unfun. And white!Tomorrow I may go out around the neighborhood but not make a day of it. Must get the flat cleaned , it already is but must make sure there is absolutely nothing left undone. I have consumed too many sausages and too many packets of biscuits. England is kicking me out for being greedy. Real World Goodness. Two sleeps at Heathrow and then , in an instant, will be back to raccoons, deer and the city of subdued excitement. I have ideas, though. Must set up studio space and get on with it. Creativity has been on hold in this tiny dangerous flat- so much for plans. Expectations , plans, goals, lead to disappointment. Sometimes we are under the illusion that we run our own show. The gods laugh , trip us up just to get their jollies. This particular one is giving you all the New York City salute.Here are some pleasing sculptures to gaze upon . Making your eyes happy!"},
{"title": "Snow, Brixton, goodbye", "date": "Monday, January 8, 2024", "text": "By the time I got to Brixton, the rain had turned to snow. Wimpy snow but snow just the same. I went to Brixton to see about my phone . The EE SIM card wants a top up but I am only here for four more days. The human told me to top up enough to get by, enough to call a cab  when I depart. But I still have four pounds thirty on the card. That should do it. Taking  a chance. Besides I needed to go say goodbye , have a farewell look around, and talk to some friendly folks. Brixton village has changed since I got here, many shops have moved out, many are in the process. It’s pretty sad. But here are the last dregs of color and whimsy , to leave us smiling as we go. To remember Brixton in a great moment.“Super cute , no one loves you, Lala”. What is “ virgin  Hair”? Theresa May, as Home Secretary, decided to make a “ hostile environment” for the Windrush  generation and their off spring. Just another reason to loathe creepy Theresa, a genuine Trump move from her tiny mind. Brixton , mostly Jamaican, suffers from that white cruelty, having established a vital community , only to have it taken away, gentrified , whitened. Some deported back to Jamaica, a land two generations away, a land they have never known.  Much like trump and his ignorance re: Mexicans. Anyway, another reason to feel sad, in case you are running out of  reasons to feel sad….pretty sure there is no shortage. A new charity shop has opened there. Fresh paint, nicely organized, well lit. I fancied three coats , but one was 160.00 pounds, one was 85.00, and the other was 56.00 .  So it goes .The end. Came back to the hole, cup of tea , Hot water bottle, another episode of “ The Repair Shop”, and  that’s it.That was my farewell to Brixton, rather , Brixton’s farewell to us all, Damn, I hate goodbyes!"},
{"title": "Love London town too much", "date": "Sunday, January 7, 2024", "text": "This was spectacular when it was working. Aquatic horologist clock , built to work in the early eighties but has not functioned for many years now. There was a water tank on the roof that , on the hour, tipped into the bucket things , which tipped onto a series of bells and chimes to mark the hour. The six figures of gardeners spilled their watering cans in a trough that held plastic flowers on floats ,so that the water level would make the flowers appear to grow. The gardener on the left would spin out facing the street to dump water on anyone below. Neal’s yard , Covent garden, that whole area is inspiring, textures and color- just cool! My attachment and love for London just increases every waking moment. Sorry my mini iPad’s photos are so poor, but they may give you an idea of how utterly amazing this city is. Multicultural is probably the best part- it is only 53% white. Bellingham is so white it looks like a perpetual snow storm,bland. I will miss diversity .i will miss everything. A woman on the bus who has lived here for eight years , originally from L A , said she would never go back. She also said that if I could come up with a viable business could park it here…not so sure that was fact. It entertained me to think about though.From the bus” mind your head” Dulwich library- y’all know how dangerous libraries can be, particularly if the masses are difficult to control when they get ideas! What I will miss most is the excellent quality of the old … this ,for instance, the everyday vendor’s booths in the apple market. Beautiful.It’s been a treat❤️. When I lived in south London in my youth, I did not even have enough money to bus anywhere. Occasionally would sneak on to  the tube, never got caught…otherwise I would have likely been kicked out of the country forever. Crazy youth. I am so lucky to have been able to revisit several times with enough cash to take the bus wherever I want. Cash is a wonderful thing, folks! On Friday this week , the day before Heathrow, Cara and Jason and baby O, will be here for two weeks. I hope to see them at least for one day ! Timing is everything ,isn’t it. flora likes her new baby cousin, Olivia. Flora s also prepping for her little brother… finally a boy baby,  to be born in early spring. There is much to look forward to, I suppose. I just wish I could look forward from London…"},

I slept for a day, discouraging  the achy  threat of  a cold or something sneaking up on me. Today, however, all is well , fit as a fiddle , they say. Weather cooperated, not a drop of rain, temperature was also mild. I went for a walk and a bus  ride into town.I was mostly curious about a pop-up shop in Covent garden- vintage clothes sold by the kilo. Nothing there for me , though I did fondle a red leather jacket, soft and worn, I could use the leather for making another thing, but I slapped my hand away, and left. Covent garden is delightful especially when the Christmas or summer crowds have gone elsewhere. Today was perfect. I have made a friend who works in Pollocks toy shop. We exchanged information, she sang for me which I recorded on my phone, lovely woman! There were things I wanted to buy, but did not, because  I haven’t even got an inch to spare in my bag. The hoards have dispersed, it is nice to go into the city center again, just in time for me to fly out of here. Dang! Anyway , nice walk around. Passed by a vintage clothing shop, I did not go in ,it was just too tempting! As you can see by the stylish mannequins in the window. Fatal attraction! If you are female and you are out and about , you take note of every available public loo. Since I was close enough to the crypt I walked there, used the loo and checked out what may be offered for lunch. Some sort of noodle stuff and the usual meat pies. Instead I went to the sausage cart sat on a stone ledge and ate with the pigeons. They are an interesting group. I tossed most of the bun to them, as you do, but they played a game of peck, chase and toss the bits -“football bun.” There were no winners,  there were no losers, either. Just a fun  game. Until a little boy ran into the middle of their skirmish-game over they had to ,once again, take pigeoning seriously , flap about frantically and act frightened , to the delight of the growling child. The sky was beginning to darken so I caught the bus to head on back to the hole.From the bus window , quick shots passing by, I especially love the barber shop guy with his apron “ old lives matter”. I got off at goose green and took a different side street back to hole. This is a nice little neighborhood.i will miss it,, you know…A very good day, I must say. Thank you sky, and thank you blogsters , my people, for coming along with me. Now a cup of tea and some brandy filled chocolates, boots off, and something about trains  on television . Love ❤️"},

Took stuff to the charity shop, the naughty shoes and the clothing that I intended to wear here and leave behind. I thought I might find something awesome to take back with me , but I only bought this hat. It is my “ fuck you spiderman” hat and I think I may wear it forevermore,Still feeling like if I went out for the day I might get ill…er. So here I am ,nap maybe, lots of vitamin c maybe, for sure some television and a blueberry custard brioche that I picked up on my little walk- Gail’s. Their stuff is way too yummy. Glad I only just realized that there is one near the Spidey hole. Christmas trash? Loads of it! Below two houses that are identical,but not. As much as I love color I think the natural brick one is more pleasing. Am I becoming more boring in my elder years- probably…what next… milk toast? Wine gums?Horlicks? Sorry but here is another selfie because one can not say “ fuck you Spider-Man ” enough….so much for aging in a dignified manner, as if I could have entertained that notion . Stay well, y’all, if you feel punk even just a little bit , my advice is to eat a blueberry custard brioche and take a nap. Sure to feel better !"},

Art dolly", "date": "Wednesday, January 3, 2024", "text": "Yesterday ,though storm Henk was blustering its way across the land, I took a couple of buses to Marylebone to meet “me mates “ at an antique market, somewhere in the vicinity . My direction skills , nonexistent, were employed and I did walk into mysterious areas. Lost, walked into a pedestrian underground, only to realize that there was a small lake at the exit. Feeling as though I may finally be going in the right direction , rather than turning back, I waded through the lake, turns out that my boots are fairly well waterproofed - leggings not. Wind and rain picked up as I wandered around in my Mr. Magoo way, finally found the meeting place.It is  a maze of shops, rooms, mirrors, like a carnival house . Sarah called from the cafe on the top floor, an easy find. I tumbled in and plopped beside Steve. Lunch was munched a cup of tea, and off we went into the maze of high end treasure. The building is very interesting, more so than the antiques , I would make it into art studios if I were King. I took two photos of lights that should be considered for Steve and Dave and their dining room…“NO Photos! Hollered from the bowels of light fixtures. Oh, sorry… like an iPad snap shot is stealing ideas? Don’t know . Anyway, the thought occurred to me that I could have told the little man that I must photo potential purchases for my husband back home who is in the process of decorating our new building , fifth avenue NYC. Pretty sure he would have believed me….” Your loss, sir”.The lights in the hall were game, photos OK. From there we wandered around a little, laughed , chatted- reveling in good company. The best day possible in a Henk storm. The neighborhood ,interesting and varied. If you google Marylebone, it will tell you that it is a more well to do part of London, this little section was not that. Not likely to see Steve again this trip. The lizard did go home with him , joyfully, to its forever home. May see  Sarah and Andy before my “woe is me” departure. Sarah made this fabulous lady doll for my birthday/ Christmas. Inspired by the dollys that we saw in the toy shop  window, she created this work of art. Gobsmacked , am I! I absolutely love her ( both dolly and Sarah)Dolly’s cardigan also hand knit by Sarah. Oh my, the genius at work here! Darling! I took the busses back after we said our goodbyes at the station. A rollicking ride through the storm, watching from the safety of the bus, wheelie luggage racing down the pavement- poles of kitch souvenirs crashing to the ground, people leaning into the force not making headway as they tried to cross the street. I got off at goose green, walked back to spideys , the wind made it an adventure, the rain ,  like little bullets, could I see? I could not. But what a wonderful day, and there they go, “  me mates”, I love these folks! Bubbye"},

You feel like a slacker, a waster of dwindling time. So, to feel somewhat productive , you plait the wool that you bought because the color suited your fancy that one day. The city can wait.You know the cords will come in handy as you have done this before . Ties that last indefinitely, as you know, having had one that you plaitedwhen you were 24 , living on a boat, and are still using to tie up your sleeping bag. Watching, plaiting, and feeling all FOMO about the day because these are likely your last days in the city that you love.Will there be another trip to London? If there is , it will be spent in better digs. But, realistically, another trip is doubtful. Unless stem cell research comes up with a fix for macular degeneration, or you get a seeing eye dog that can also book tickets and look up bus schedules….Now it is after three in the afternoon, the sky darkening , not a good time to go out ,so….The last mince pie, a cup of tea, and  a thought for auld lang syne.  We welcome the new year warily…we have been tricked  before so not entirely trusting the flip of the calendar. As Mary mentioned, this so called new year is an election year. Can our hearts handle it? When I arrived Spider-Man asked that I water his little ficus. It was sitting in four inches of fetid water. Drowning. I took it out of the pot,  dried it out over about five days, put it back n its pot , put it on the sill, told it that it was very pretty, sang   “ good day sunshine” to it , and now it is pumping out baby leaves. I feel terrible about leaving it with Spider-Man, clearly he hasn’t a clue about living things. I have grown very fond of this little ficus.That has been my New Year’s Day….i wish you all the best wishes. Buckle in, it’s going to be a rough ride. Getting used to it aren’t we. We won’t be fooled again. Please. Lunch today, utterly perfect. Scotch egg. Not “ Scottish”. They were first made in Yorkshire, so says Mr. Goggle. A handy travel lunch. I will try to make some when I get back to my own kitchen…that is if it is still mine. Having been gone for so long there is another human that has taken over. I may have to wrestle him to the ground until he hollers “ uncle”. I had a big brother, I know how it works."},

They were ok until I got back , slept a sleep, awoke in the morning , tried to walk across the room , my leg said” nope”. That is what happens with worn shoes, tilt. Muscles and joints compensate but suffer.Advil  and loads of water seem to put it right. I wore my boots to go out and about yesterday. I decided to get off after about an hour and a half . A place I had not been to before. London is full of such discoveries for those who have time and an oyster card. I went through a large gate to a garden . A magnificent house at one end, now a restaurant. The garden shed is so charming, still used to house tools. The garden itself might have been beautiful  , after winter storms and rain it was a muddy playground for a wiggly romping red dog and its  human. I walked on for about 25 minutes, pausing to appreciate Saint Mary’s church and a plaque designating the rails beneath the bridge. Old time railroad! Finally I came upon the gates to The Design Museum, and Holland Park. The museum’s exhibits were not free nor were they of any interest to me, I wandered through the gift shop , left and walked up though the park. So many cute dogs!  The center of London is still a sea of humans so going to an outside area was just the ticket. Holland  Park, though small , is well worth hanging out in. When I stayed near Holland Park on one of my stays in London, it was my front yard, sort of. Everyday I walked through to get to wherever I did roam. A couple of shops down from the gate is my favorite art supply , Cass Arts. There was a sale going on …I drooled and lusted over inks but bought nothing, which I may regret when I get back to Bellingham. I walked on, the sun going down quickly, boarded a bus that took me through the madness of Picadilly and Regent Street to Trafalger, where I caught the usual bus back to Spidey hole. It’s still crazy frantic out there, the sales have begun.This morning my leg is better, after Advil, shoes make all the difference. Probably did not help staying in during the storm. My legs forgot what they were for. I got up at 5:00 AM to get a real person on the phone at Heathrow to check on my hotel reservation, the one I thought I had messed up. (Hounslow) I had not messed it up after all and had booked the right place, yay, they had just sent the wrong address in the email. All set. Things back at home are stagnant, the usual, though Dennis bought another car. Now he has three. But this new one is Oh-My-Gawd! $46,790.00 Tesla model Y , all wheel drive , 330 miles on one charge…so they claim. I am gobsmacked, surprised and astounded. I-can’t - even! But, there you go….he claims he is saving the globe from climate change, which may be  noble in its intent…walking is more affordable, I say, but then…did I walk across the Atlantic to get here? I did not! MYOB , self. 85 is a good age to buy a  dream car that will also “save our planet” . So… just sayin’, (spoiler alert)  the planet will not be saved and life is short , eighty five years  makes that  more certain, so whatever makes you glad, do that thing."},

Writing letters, watching television, eating pies, generally being reflective and lazy. A forced break. Erik phoned on Christmas, everyone at the house for “ Dad’s brunch”. Erik and Dennis went to goodwill , bought schlock Christmas decorations , a plastic tree, and snowman place mats. The table looked ok, if that is your aesthetic and you are five years old. Anyway a  fun father/son bonding experience.Yesterday I had to get out or go mad. I thought of something I wanted at the toy shop in Covent garden, so that is where I went. Nearly everything was sold out but I did find something flat and packable to purchase. A pattern to make and use as a template to make many for Christmas next year. .the juggler in the street performer’s square, shouting and singing loudly through a megaphone, the crowd, clapping and cheering and screaming, had little effect on this guy snoozing through the day. A safe place, a dog cuddled under his blankets, keeping warm. From there I went to Saint Martin in the field to use the loo and to see if there was music in the church. There was not but the photo taking was good. As churches go , this one  pleases me. Full of light and goodwill to all.Wind kicked up and the rain began to come down , like walking under water! I caught the bus back. A few not so great shots from the bus window with my inferior mini pad camera. We make do. Good timing. By the time I got back to Spidey hole, the weather howled and dumped and shook the windows!  I thought of Steve and Olga by the sea… pretty sure that Olga was not happy to go out into it. No, this is a pink blanket, stay by the fire day.Queen E on a hoverboard, keeping calm on a wall near by.. Death, the ultimate calm. I miss her. Charles may be a good king ,he has been well received and his global ,kind, outlook is needed and welcomed. But his merch is not as pretty… and that is how shallow I am! The Charles coins are  homely, as his physiognomy has never been as pretty as his mother’s. Again, shallow, that is how I keep from drowning….These Times!A cup of tea, another pie, and a squiggle in my moleskin , “Sarah and her cat children.”. Sarah has been overwhelmed with work . I have not seen her over the holidays, contributing to more alone time , more reflection and some measure of sadness . The human condition, the fouled earth nest, our mother…the loss. Of course the wars… we  learn nothing from history, short term memories do not serve us well.The pallet is from the children’s charity shop. Great tin of watercolors from Germany, good quality. One quid , never had been used. Also packable. The weather will be shite for the next week . I may be glad to have something to do other than watch brilliant British television programing! My all time fave is this- In the fifties my friend had a  “ round about” in her attic, we spun around for hours. I have not seen one since,  until the repair shop brought one back to life.  It is such a compelling program. The artisan experts are brilliant and compassionate about other’ s broken treasure, they heal  hearts , bring back memories. Stuff is not just stuff! Treasures are not clutter , Marie Kondo! Snap out of it! On we go."},

I decided to check it out first-a dry run. Turns out that was wise of me. The shop was full of china , twee cups and saucers. Pricey , too. Nothing of interest. I wandered around the high street. The area  is middle class posh-not at all interesting but wonderful for young wealthy families, it would seem from the fancy pram parade. There was one , only one, homeless guy whose bed room was quite a nice set up in an empty storefront. He was not far , sitting on a wall eating a great looking lunch spread out like a picnic. He was pleasant, the passers by were pleasant. He was well liked and well known. One in fifty people are homeless in London, this guy chose a great little pocket to keep himself. There are several little indy shops on the street and a Dolphin School where, I am sure, all of the fancy babies go. It all seemed very Stepford, white, homogenized, so, yes, good call on my part, dry run paid off.Today is the day that my poor mother had to drop the Christmas cookie project and head off into a Winter-in- Wyoming blizzard to the hospital, a nose full of ether and out popped a little sister for the two and a half year old boy being cared for by the neighbors until mom could get back with her new child. Two days before Christmas is a shite time to have a birthday. Today I went out -no particular agenda, just the street market and to see what was left in the charity shops, which was fuck all. I wandered down a street that I have not been down, and voila.. happy birthday baby, there was a Gail’s Bakery! I bought a birthday sandwich, two chocolate almond croissants, an onion tart, a sausage roll -brought it all back to the Spidey hole to have a mighty fine birthday nosh. Not all at once , some will be my Christmas nosh as well. Now ensconced in a wooly wrap, watching a Christmas movie , staring Emilia  Clarke, Emma Thompson as her Croatian mother… it’s entertaining with just the right amount of schlock, “ Last Christmas “. The big clue about the plot is -last Christmas I gave you my heart…Tomorrow I may go to Brixton which could go either way- joyful day before or panicky day before. I am banking on JOY. Steel drums , colorful market and singing bible bangers, as baby Jesus would have it. Happy birthday one and all! Shopfront floor"},

It is like dreamworld where you can fly or teleport instantly to somewhere incredible.    I  took the number 40. Which I rarely do, to go to the Tate Modern. When the bus stopped at the get off point, I could see the Tate and started walking toward it, but decided instead to walk across the mighty river ,on Blackfriars bridge. I don’t think it gets enough attention, over shadowed  by other more grand bridges. It was rebuilt from the original 1700’s, for queen Victoria to cheer her up after Albert died. A new rail bridge was also built but the pillars of the old remain, doing nothing, going nowhere.The bridge is quite a beauty up close, each pier, where one can sit or look out, is pulpit shaped in reference to the monks, the Blackfriars, with carved sea creatures and birds on the bases. Each different from the other. The Thames, 66 feet deep, turbulent undercurrent , freezing cold, too wide to swim to shore if you fell from the edge of this bridge…feels to me like it would not take much  of a bump to topple  over and into the river, the sides are low. Too short for safety. I pretty much ran across the bridge out of anxiety . Cold wind and rain also encouraged me to move more quickly. So, I am on the other side of my intended destination.. I know, I will just walk up to Saint Paul’s to see the pigeons. Turn right on Pilgrim street and head in the general direction of the dome.The fee to get in the front door is expensive. I have been in , for free, in 2017, when I went to the memorial service for Michael Bond, author of Paddington Bear. Along with about  300 others, as well as the actors from the paddington films.  Hugh Bonneville, Steven Frye and Michael’s granddaughter read from the books , it was joyous and sweet and well mannered. After coming from the cathedral, going down the stairs ,I , without realizing until later was walking in tandem , three hands away from a good hand shake ,with Mr. Bonneville. Then I dashed off to find a shop selling Paddington bears. They were all sold out. All of that just to say that I did not go in, I only went down below, to the crypt and gift shop, where I bought a little god thing for Fresca. Used the loo, warmed up, wandered around the immediate area a bit.. looked at art everywhere. Found the number 40 , as the sky darkened and the temperature dropped. Chasing down the bus warmed me up.. I walked farther than I intended. In my usual direction challenged way I got turned around. Shepherd and his flock, by Elisabeth Frink.Below , a massive work by, Thomas Heatherwck.Back to the spider hole as  night descended, hot water bottle and a cup of tea . How lucky I feel. Like I won all of the lotteries. I dare not watch or listen to the news ."},

Steve made his way to the spider hole, looked around , noted the cuteness factor of the flat itself , the obsession with Peter Parker’s radiated bug bite, super power arthropod , in a muscle revealing sexy skin tight  Spidey suit, decor fit for a fourteen year old lad, questionable for a man in his mid  40’s . A chat, a quick look around ,that took all of three seconds,, and off we went , out into the weather. The mirror at the charity shop is a splendid thing . I would have it if I lived closer to London than to mount Rainier. Neither of us made a purchase in this shop, though there was a bit of catch and release. I  am limited by one bag travel, Steve is limited by common sense. His skills in editing are admirable. Another catch and release in the children’s charity shop a few doors down - Steve found this magnificent lizard, a difficult one to put back on the shelf. Finally, spending a little time in Steve’s good company. People should not have to work, you know, specially  when friends from afar are in town. Should be a law. ( speaking  of law, news f the day, Colorado stepped up , banning trump from the ballot in their state. That may be the wave that takes him out. Heightened hope. Maybe I will return to a nation that has miraculously snapped out of its self destruction)After checking a couple more shops ,we ducked into  East Dulwich pub for lunch and a pint. The fire invited us to the back room of animal heads, baubles , wooden clothes hangers and a broken telephone body.  I have missed my calling- probably too late for me to set up an interior design business in London. Steve sensibly ordered a safe and predictable cheeseburger. I, on the other hand , ordered my usual pub fare, sausage and mash. This came as a surprise, fished fresh from the loo? Though the presentation was off putting ,   it was delicious, eyes closed. The only purchase I made was this wooden puppet that can fit into my sock. I wish I had Steve around more often to modify by example.  Grateful for time spent in his company. As you know, he is fun and lovely , and have I mentioned “sensible”? , Hoping for more time after the new year , maybe to see Olga and Dave and to eat something prettier than intestine shaped pork.Another day closer to returning to the PNW, where the rain is equal to London  but less wet. I better get busy planning another trip."},

Rocks rock, I want one of these  but I think it is illegal to take on virgin air. Wouldn’t one of these make a great headstone ! I do have some rocks packed, the ones I pocketed from Dungeness with Sarah and Andy. I looked up country no-no’s , gathering stones from a UK beaches  is one. I will take my chances. I thought about mailing them but that is even more stringent.  I may go to airport jail for my love of rocks.I went inside to view Ruben’s portraits and drawings. It is small gallery, doable in about a half hour, depending . Ruben’ s drawings appealed to me most, and his clear fascination for breast feeding women and hermaphrodites. He was so ahead of his time. More advanced / accepting than the weirdo society we live in todayMan woman.Here are a couple of drawings that photographed ok. Most did not, faint lines and an inadequate iPad.If I started drawing classically instead of from a comic book  , I might be able to draw convincingly…just like this! Might take several lifetimes - how delicious and satisfying  would be the reward.   Nothing going on today, the sun is out so a walk to the park may be the excitement for today. Not sure what the day holds. I got up at 4:30 am to chat with Dennis and to acknowledge the latest email from Spidey. Nutty.Leaving you with this too-sweet-for-words painting.

I had never heard of it before I passed this fence. It is some sort of petroleum based paint that never fully dries and is impossible to wash off hands or clothing. If it warms up or is subjected to climbing it will ruin the day. I did not doubt the sign. I did not climb the fence, though now I am tempted just because…An odd canopy created out of vinyl records over a balcony. Use what you have on hand.

The posts validate  the mental fragility of the lad, though he has skills. Admirable outdoor videos . Now I know where he is, and thank the stars , he is more than a few miles away. So, there you go, another wonderful day of being in a town I love. Of being not a gentlewoman . My bag is well packed so I do not have to think about it. Leaving behind my intentional old clothes to the charity shop in Brixton. I only brought clothing that I am glad to part with. Taking art supplies backwith me. Sort of in limbo , neither here nor there. That is what happens when I travel and am about to return…I rarely want to go back home, but once there I am glad.

No one other than billionaires can afford to live in Dulwich these days- loaded with history, buildings from late 1500’s early 1600’s.There are many dogs , many rich young families, a sedate neighborhood, not much going on. Just charm and safety.The house  and chapel where  Edward is planted under the floor.The College. Of God’s gift, establish by a high rolling Elizabethan actor, who had his finger in every pie, Edward Alleyn, a favorite of queen Elizabeth. The college was established in 1619, for twelve poor boys from several different boroughs in London, during plague and Elizabethan poverty. He was a doer of good.he was a lucky man of wealth and talent. Also offered an education from his college to six poor girls…generous during a time when girls were considered  a waste of education…. He purchased a mansion and vast surrounding  lands, establish the village and the college, still active today. Though, as time has gone by, the college has not been without scandal.  The raping of boys comes to mind. Anyway, the village remains charming old world ish.More recent houses maintain the character of “ Village aesthetic “.  The houses along the roads are well kept. One can very nearly smell the money. It smells nice enough, plus there were a couple of protest signs in windows, against the Tories, supporting strikes. So it does not appear to be politically conservative… one would have to live in the village for a while to realize . I would volunteer, especially if the stay was affordable. Since I was in the neighborhood I went to the cemetery, the park, and the picture gallery, a Ruben and Won exhibit. The drawings by Ruben were my favorites. Drawing is the bare bones of an artist, I reckon. Too many photos already so I will leave the gallery and the walk home for another day. Weather has improved , promise of sunshine at the week end. Staying away from central London - Christmas crowds and massive protests , pro Palestine, ceasefire, have me looking elsewhere for interest. I may go back to wander the village more and to get delicious bakery goods from Gail’s. Bought several things, a blueberry muffin being one. I ate the top , looked down , and a lion appeared!"},

A marvel of Victorian engineering - in all aspects, this building ,the huge machinery , the elderly volunteers , and the dry sandwiches in the little cafe, made the drive there so worthwhile. I must add that Sarah is the most remarkably skilled driver in the universe. London and most of England presents unworldly challenges for a driver. Mr. toad’s ride is real! Miss Sarah navigates like a boss. A pricey ticket to enter, one is free to roam throughout, issued hard hat, probably for effect rather than for real safety concerns.  Everything inside the poo sorter is  buckled down , well oiled and solid, as things should be. All of the machinery is in fine working order, most of the structures painted as they were back in the good ol’ stinky days. Victorian era , over the top decorating! Everything is worthy! This bit of engineering saved London from poo. It only has “Open Day” twice a month. Difficult to get to unless you have a Sarah. It is located in a bleak area, thus the name “ Crossness” , I  am assuming. I would be cross if I had to live there.We were both very glad to have gone. Fabulous place. The floor, though a little unnerving , is more substantial than its fish scale airy design appears. We determined that we both know people who would not walk on it. Don’t look down.After getting our fill of mega machines and thinking about our dads , who would have absolutely loved this poo plant, Sarah drove us back to hers, a cup of tea, a cake, and a bit of cat love, she drove Andy to his brothers to watch football, and me back to the “ don’t touch anything” spider hole. Memorable, fabulous day here in the Big Stink. I have decided to use as little as possible, one bowl, one fork, one knife , one spoon, keep the lights off and the heat low, only use the cavity magnetron  ( micro wave) instead of the gas cooker. Mind you I am paying grandly  for the “ privilege” of staying in Spider-Man’s castle,  been reminded several times….i am torn between my child self who wants to leave messages in books on the shelf, turn on all of the lights all at once, run up spideys electric bill,   and my adult self who wants to not make waves. I will behave but the thought did occur because I am not 100% good.  I really don’t think spider man would scream at a male person that way.

Our mission was the toy shop up the tiny narrow stairway into the tiny room carefully curated with fabulous  toys and games, mostly hand crafted , wood, wool, paper… good quality and adorable. Sarah bought a book and a kit to make a lion. On we went ,through the Yards and alleys in between streets.The bullseye window is in Bedford Court, beautiful little alley from the 1700’s or so. Charming. We stopped for gelato in the Yards. That was our day, Sarah caught the train to Blackheath to shop a little , I caught the bus back to East Dulwich. On the way I listened to a fraction of world news…humans suck, no doubt, seems to have lost its collective mind. Biden has thoroughly disappointed re: ceasefire…pulling a trump move, I reckon, isolating USA even further from allies.. Biden may indeed be unfit as well. Never mind nothing I can do about that horror, I have Spider-Man to contend with, small insanities….A pup on the bus licking my hand and allowing me to scritch his soft warm ear flaps, makes it all better. Dog is good, truly. The usual long bus ride , about an hour. Getting off at Goose Green, the stop before my road.  The walk is good, shakes  off the news of the human world , somewhat, walking is a healer ! Window of one of the charity shops along the way. Beautifully painted! Charity shops here have upped the game - a measure of pride and caring. Although they are not cheap, bowled over  by their pricing. Expensive recycling? Monies go to worthy causes , better than buying from corporate. It all evens out. This is my tiny Christmas decor, Mrs. raccoon, from Fresca, tree from Stella, card from Inga, the cleaner, bundled  up button boy from Sarah and rubber happy man from the gutter. All of that Christmas joy takes up six inches of space. Christmas in a pocket, not much more is required -except maybe that bus pup!

Especially for a group of older folks, with sticks and wheels.In the department store in Brixton I bought a whistling kettle sans plastic lid. A woman next to me said, “ oh my lord, I have not had a whistling kettle for years! Why do you want one-they make noise, I always forgot about turning them off because I got too used to the sound”. “ not my idea” , I answered. “Oh yes, men are full of ideas….you should get an electric kettle and tell him to bugger off.” Going to Brixton really makes my day! An entire section in homeware  devoted to David Bowie, mugs ,pillows, shopping totes….he is bigger than Elvis , bigger than Jesus- Bowie rules Brixton. Large frame able  cards of wisdom. I love the both, but especially the first one! My biking days are  well and truly over.  I will never be more awesome….This little frisky cat was playing with the hair extensions and rolling around like it had just found the very best thing, one happy cat! On my way back I stopped at the vegan bakery to get a veggie pasty and an orange almond sweet thing…the name of the bakery has met with “ someone is offended” wokeness. Seems the the owner of the franchise based in Greenwich, is Greek. She chose the name after a traditional baked good in Greece- a rich chocolate cake served with ice cream and sauce…hooligans adopted the name using it as a racial slur .  News to me but a Greek person sees the name of the bakery as we might see the “ n” word. So, there is outrage, but the owner of Arapina bakeries is not about to change it. What next-Sweaty Betty? Think of all of the Betties that may find that offensive! When I arrived at the spider door , a Christmas card greeted me…from Inga  , the cleaner! Sweet. I also walked in to see the orphans trying to build a snow man. They do have their own ideas….this, you see, is how it’s done.Christmas  from Stella Bella! Thoughtful as always , a peach of a gal!"},

There are four cats that needed a human to serve them. I took the bus , had to transfer at Catford, how appropriate! At Catford center bus stop there is a giant cat perched on the sign above the walk. Feet from it the smaller ones sit. As I was coming down the stairs of the bus a large man blocked my way intentionally and wouldn’t move. Sorry, excuse me please, but he just got closer , like , REALLY close. And then he growled at me and called me a silly cow… the visual of a cow being silly made me laugh though I know it is a capital British insult, lucky he did not stab me, ,finally got around him , off that bus, on to another. The insane man looked like Pete, the Disney character that started out in 1925 as an anthropomorphic bear, but when Mickey came around , Pete became a large ugly bully cat. Never know what one might run into on public transportation. Also appropriate for my cat watching gig. Sarah’s cats are lovely , though. Sarah’s house is wonderful. The angels and pony are on her Christmas wall.clever Sarah! Hyper realism is not art, these are! The pony is my favorite.The internet was down so I watched cats and TV, too cold to go for a wander.Saturday night Dennis sent me a message that Spider-Man wanted an explanation about the kettle, the cleaner reported to him that the damage was extensive…no idea but it made me so nervous that Sunday morning I charged back to see what the hell he might be talking about. It was a kettle in its kettle way of being when I left…The plastic lid, which serves no real purpose , got too hot at some point and melted the edges. Why is a plastic lid even part of a kettle? And at the hottest part? Only Spider-Man knows. It’s a well used kettle , wonky loose handle, also plastic. Plastic kettle must make sense to some , flying off the shelves, in spider land.Drama queen…anyway he was his usual upset irrational self, Dennis mentioned in a note that I left a tip for the cleaner, as you do, and he lost his shit over that as well, said it was forbidden for her to accept money from a guest. Then he wanted to know why I had gone to Scotland and left the flat vacant for such an extended period of time…I know…the lad is mad.no one had gone to Scotland, unless you think Greenwich is there?I can not get email here and I am pleased about that really, nice vacation from all of that …so Dennis checks my email and lets me know if spidey is having a meltdown about whatever. Nothing that a little ethylchloride wouldn’t fix, in case you are not up on what weakens super radiated spider bitten teenage boys, that is it! Good to know. This morning the internet was off, the TiVo was off and the lights were flickering, I am so paranoid about Spidey now that I was semi certain he did some sort of Spidey manipulation to make me pay attention and be sorry, especially since I will not answer his emails directly. But it was just the wind, and you can see that I am back. All is well, until the next drama. I have packed just in case. I must say though that in print Spider-Man actually sounds less nuts. That is probably why he only wants to communicate through the company. I went to the post office, which generally has a line of folks under stacks of packages, but not today! Good timing! Then I was sure I needed my own coffee mug so that I do not contaminate , or worse, chip one of spideys, bought one in the charity shop across the street, Cath Kidson floral. Much better. So , things are looking up. But I can say that was not my favorite couple of days. Plus I reserved a hotel room for before I leave to  make sure I get to my flight on time. Thought I had it in the bag but my thumb and poor vision reserved the wrong place, nonrefudable…in Houndslow! That made me laugh nearly as much as silly cow. No one goes to Houndslow intentionally! Silly cow!"},

The building is a massive echo chamber . I did a quick run up the stairs , look around, gift shop and -outa there!  I asked the guard at the door where the Christmas joy was this year and why was the front all torn up with heavy machinery doing its worst? He shrugged.Pretty much a gorilla face  Christmas  this year, so far…The fence has been painted since last I was here. It is gorgeous .all of the carved monkeys that climb on every arch , have been dusted and fed. They seem content. The blue whale that stretches across the vast ceiling looked better in the ocean. Definitely needs to eat a sandwich or something, as you can see! I suppose it is impressive.Charles ,his usual humorless self , watches as people come and go, probably rethinking his theory of evolution, as humans devolve. He is disappointed.I walked to the V&A to see the bomb damage that occured during the blitz. It is really quite stunning. Blasted! Here are a few holes, they are large and pepper that side of the museum dramatically. Kept as is , a memorial ,as though the horror of the blitz might ever be forgotten. But, humans are slow learners it would appear and not many who go down exhibition row even notice the large bites taken from the structure. Folks are more excited to go inside to see something lovely. So much lovely it is a complete overwhelm. I barely made it through the gift shop! Took a couple of photos .Getting a bit late I decided to walk up to Albert hall to catch a bus. Bad timing, every child ever born was also on the bus. I should know better than to time my journeys the hour of school let out. Like I said, humans are slow learners, I am one of those. Traffic was also slow during that time, so, it took two hours to get back to spideys. I stopped at the grocery to get something for dinner. The woman ahead of me was buying for a party, she spent about £1500.00 - having a party for over one thousand people! Pretty sure she will not be doing the cooking or the cleanup. She must have hired an army for that- armies for cooking is a much better use for them than blowing up the world. Dang… put a woman in charge!From the bus window."},

Initially built for a nobleman , a tutor for prince fancy pants, they knew how to treat royal teachers - the house is magnificent. It is free for roaming on your own. It is now a community center, venue, library, cafe. During wartime it was used as a hospital, housed 15 patients. The grounds are lovely, forms Charlton park , used by everyone and their dog.  Sausage  sandwiches and coffee in the cafe, then a walk through the house. Massive and elegant, original oak staircase, original everything except for one wing that met with a blitz bomb. A few furniture items remain but mostly the rooms are empty. The fire places remain, looking as good as they did in the early 1600’s. Of course there are more photos but I will take you to the cute little community library that is downstairs behind little doors, short folks back then…Short doors.Then Sarah took us to an even older site.- a little hill with a protective fence surrounding it . Sarah’s neighborhood was incorporated into London in 1885 , or so. It still has a village feel . The history is rich and delicious! I would love the rest of my days here, happily. Charlton is in The borough of Greenwich, beautiful.Today is a day in, cleaning , washing , painting the house around the corner for my moleskin,,which has gone wanting,,and eating bourbon creams."},

There was nothing remotely pleasant about either. London is depressed this year, the windows are sad. I had to use the loo so went to Liberty of London. Looked Around a bit , mostly because the toilet is on the third floor, common knowledge that Liberty is ridiculous…but beautiful. While on the stairs to the loo, I took photos from the windows.This pale green, size twelve  women’s, frock caught my eye, probably for the wrong reasons. I thought is was a comical prop. It was on the “sale” rack for the equivalent of $1485.00 . The absurdity of said dress and the sale price is Liberty’s M O. Weirdest fabric, designed  by a three year old, most certainly, little wonder it was on the sale rack, for such a bargain of a price! Can you even imagine spending all of your reserve on this puff and actually having the questionable judgement to wear it to dinner? Comedy/ tragedy/ weirdo. Another dress that I thought was cute for a seven year old,  but in a womanly size- priced at a more reasonable $1,080.00….who buys this stuff? Obviously not we of sane body and mind.! I guess they are out there ,though, shopping madly ,and so, the world turns. I left, giving ten pounds to beggars outside, one had a cat. And one had a smile.A walk down Regent street to catch the bus back to Brixton, where life feels grounded in reality and the fashion in the charity shops is so much better- imaginative, creative, Fresca knows! She is the queen of charity innovation and heart.  Working with what’s in front of you, working with what you are dealt.Charity shops are the best. The art on the street for Christmas in Brixton is far more brilliant than the sad million dollar windows in the so-called fancy section of town.. Povo’s rule the day.From Brixton I caught another bus back to Goose Green ( which sounds like a terrible color choice) , walked back to spidey hole in the dark. That adventure in high rent commercial London,  need never be repeated, I took one for the team… you never need to go there, you are welcome. Brixton  wins."},

London is like that, any direction is a wonder  well worth exploration. Going back to my ho-Dee-do life will be a let down no doubt., plus there is all of that political shite , difficult to avoid, so, for now, I walk and bus contentedly, the politics of the UK are amusing . David Cameron is back, made a Lord  to get his foot in the door ,described as “a disappointed jacket potato ,too long in the microwave”, everyone bemused about the absurdity. So, yeah, not the existential dread that the United States faces.  Bland ,moist jacket potato - can not hold a candle to the evil doings in the United Stares Of  Bullshite- .No competition- USA wins.  Argentina is prettyfucked up but does not count, because it is not “a beacon”. Trump inspired the entire globe, just in time to make matters worse for the human species.  Brilliant. Well played , worst of human nature in action, well played…Shakespeare said it best. Paradigm stubborn. I went into SaintGiles because choral music was spilling out. The church isn’t much though I am sure it is historically  significant. I then meandered through SoHo. Square. Pretty little area, statue of Charles the second  stands in the center. A statue from early 1600 , once part of a fountain, now alone , weathered , repaired badly, but thoughtfully given a bottle of wine ,by some empathetic admirer.This rocking horse was smooshed in between pews at Saint Giles. One of the only things of interest in the building , other than the choir.Walking on…….sorry , this post is beginning to look like a school slide   report, “ what we did on our holiday and the things we did see”.Ok ,I will stop now….but not until I take you back to the spider hole, through the neighborhood and back to a cup of tea. Pink jeep, uncommon sight. I peeked inside looking for “Just Ken.” No one there but the interior was leather and lovely , cream and pink delish!Good day and good night.

It was 9:30, after the morning mass , church open and empty. I wandered around, took a few photos, this one of a banner looked especially worthy- A few Mary’s, zero dead guys on a stick… a bright interior. Then a choir began their practice, sounded amazing. So I sat to listen for a while. Suddenly a woman was introducing herself as the vicar saying “ pleasure to have you here, welcome”, took my hands and smiled.well, it would be rude to leave, wouldn’t it? So I stayed . The church started its business. Music, hymns, prayers with excessive clouds of incense smoke billowing to the ceiling ,choking the congregation…was , could have been , lethal! Eyes burning, the church became a fog . Ok, still rude to leave,probably, I stayed for the sermon which wasn’t terrible, mostly about inclusion of trans folks and gay folks and how everyone could be helpful, donate to the fund…be kind, listen to  one another. Ok so far, then - the readings, three of them, all three were fucked up interpretations of god talk, god being his mean old self . Maybe I could sneak out now… nope - the ushers guarded the pews and marched us up to the kneely thing for a crappy wafer and a sniff of wine, I got a blessing because I said no thank you to the snack. Anyway, awkward… upon leaving, at the entry,  vicar again shook my hand, and I was polite, but I wanted to question their gods intent and the bollocks readings. “ mind your own business”, I said to me, left, went for a walk through hyperbolic autumnal weather. The park was a flurry of leaves and wind kicking up around joyful dogs. Speaking of…Sarah took me to the pet cemetery on Friday. We agreed that the panic was cruel / horrendous, and we would never obey orders like that, but people are strange, especially when fear is ever present threatening horrors that are not yet a reality, War does that, god also does that…seems fear is the best manipulation to survival ever, played to the max.used by religions, keep your offerings  healthy , as the ushers pass the hat…fear is more god than any of the gods.

Carol , favorite weather person , has been  making weather happen on BBC for about 23 years. Her delightful personality and lilting Scottish accent carries the nation through the worst and best weather. When she starts her report it is always “gud morrrning” smiling effortlessly, and everyone believes that , yes, it is a good morning no matter if the weather is shite.Sunshine expected for the day so I planned to spend it outside. The sixteen and a half acre garden/ park at the Horniman museum not far from here looked just right. Fewer people , interesting garden, beautiful overlook of the city in the distance.  It is a nature paradise, all sorts of plants , some unexpected  , tropical and dessert , and a small area for farm animals. Art crops up throughout the walk. Musical art with hammers hanging along the sides to play the instruments. The museum is brilliant for children especially, inside loads of anthropological displays as well as a great collection of taxidermist work. Live animals on the outside dead ones on the inside.The imposing building in the background is one I see frequently on the horizon in East Dulwich. I have grown to admire it though at first, because of its mega sized solid structure , it looked out of place and bossy. It was built in 1964 , Kate Macintosh architect, and houses 300 flats with a few balconies , a communal garden and individual fire escapes, a definite plus for the city with horrendous fire history. It is called Dawson’s Heights. There are great photos in Mr Googles library, mine does it no justice at all. It has been described as 60’s space age cool, built in a time when quality was still a goal.I bought cards in the gift shop, warmed up , the chill outside let you know you were alive! Just like back home, when the sun shines in winter you better pack an extra layer. In the shop the clerk asked me from where in Ireland I came.. I said “ America Ireland”, satisfied with that answer she said “ I knew you was Irish , could tell from your strong accent”. Must be the “ Rrrr’ s”. Caught the usual bus and since I was already headed that way I went  into the city . At Waterloo the driver ordered everyone off the bus. It was going no farther due to diversion. That’s the thing about busses , no warning. I got off at Waterloo, walked to trafalgar thinking to walk up hay market to Piccadilly Circus to my favorite BOOTS pharm to get stuff.  BOOTS are all over the place, you can always find one close by, but my favorite one is three floors with everything you could ever need. It is sparkling clean, antiseptic and well laid out. Drug store bliss! Anyway, the sun was going down so the decision was made for me, to head back to the spider flat. Got to the bus stop and the damned bus never came- another diversion. I walked a while until I found one that might work. By the time I got back, it was dark, good call."},

Charming!Homes to wizards, apparently . Or maybe a hide out.In the toy shop, hand made dolls are sold out but are still in the showcase. I don’t know who the maker is but she is in demand, I guess, and her dolls are very expensive. I will try to make one when I get back. My sewing machine is calling. Christmas is on. Village of little log cabins in the square, selling everything that no one needs.Riding the bus today ,there were pros aboard! The first, a young mother with twin toddlers in a duel buggy, as well as a four year old, and a nursing baby! The other a young girl who boarded as plain Jane, while rumbling along she applied four layers of make up, brushed on flawlessly. Then came shading, then blush and highlights. She then curled her eyelashes bouncing along, bus threatening to yank them sideways, then two layers of mascara and shading shadow. Took her hair out of the bun thing and set her long shiny locks free. Then she took a large bowl from her leather bag, as well as rice ,noodles, chicken and veg, put it together, stirred it and stirred it some more using chop sticks, which after her concoction had been eaten, were carefully placed back into the paper wrap.  Before her stop, she removed her baggy athletic trousers, smoothed her dress, changed from sneakers into heels and - voila, ready for the day!Good thing the busses are slow. As long as there are humans , there will be war. The dioramas are housed in  science museum. Poppies this year are paper, no plastic. Armistice day was the usual well choreographed stellar ceremony ,  poignant two minutes of nationwide silence. 11/11@ 11. Amazing to have the city stop! Not  a good week end to go into the city, too crowded, plus the massive pro Palestinian march, so, I watched all of it onBBC one. Right wing drug/ alcohol fueled dumb asses disrupted the protest with violence, of course. The home secretary( one of them) was sacked because she took the lid off the crazy right wing nuts, gave them a boost.The sorriest in the procession, were the “ lab rats”, as they call  themselves. The boys/ men sent to “paradise” they were told, to Christmas Island - thought they had won the lottery. Given sunglasses for protection, they endured , at close range, multiple atom bomb blasts, just to collect information. Everyone already knew what the bomb would do but were unsure of the long term  effects in a controlled blast. Needless to say there are but a handful of rats left, they are unwell, and they are bitter…given a newly minted medal at least there is recognition. No favor, no compensation. Cruel, as is everything war related.In the middle of the Strand is this humble centuries old church. The stairs are so worn that exiting the building is like sliding down  a slide! This is the RAF church for veterans, a gathering place to honor their service, their pride, their sorrow, their camaraderie .Another controversy this Veterans Day is the introduction of the black poppy especially recognizing black/ brown soldiers, diaspora of  colonies,  the ruling while male class objects, because….of course. Veterans day in the UK has more admiration and sentimentality, true respect,  than in the USA, where national patriotism seems to be aggression and shame , flag waving and false admiration.During the blitz in England , particularly in London, as you know,killed over 43,000 civilians, destroyed about 1.1 million homes and flats, and lasted continually, relentlessly,  for 8 months. It was a different war here back then. The nation worked together, hand in hand, while other nations waffled.”not my circus”…."},

Grey ,then blue, back to grey again within moments. I wore my plastic coat, great for being in rain and wind, but like wearing a refrigerator when temperature drops. There was no rain. If Spider-Man does not vanquish this foe, I may have to charity shop for a warm coat. Here for the long haul.Anyway the back side of the Albert hall is gorgeous, interesting, and … red . Extreme fondness for red brick in Kensington.Window boxes are still flowering , though days are numbered. Wouldn’t it be lucky to have stacks of cash to live here for a few years?The walkway leads to Prince Consort street, past the Jamaican embassy and on to exhibition row.Remember getting Rick Rolled several years ago?

Decided I had better get back, unsure of which bus to catch, temperature unfriendly especially dressed in an ice bag.I found a bus that  would get me to Vauxhall central , in a round about way, crossing the river on the charming little Chelsea bridge, through Battersea and round the back of the station, to catch the usual bus back to Goose Green.  If you can make it to theVauxhall bus station ,you can connect to everywhere. I took so many photos in the science museum that I overwhelmed my device. It is the best museum on the planet, I reckon…though I admit to not having been to every museum on the planet, Goals? Not enough life in front of me, time is not my friend.  I’ve had a pretty good run, unlike many of my generation. Sad face , Iron lung in the background. The fright of everyone in our neighborhood, I was still too young to charge  around independently , getting infected, but I do remember going around with my mother, collecting for the March of Dimes. Posters everywhere of warnings ,children in iron lungs, braces, using crutches and wheel chairs. Folks gave their dimes generously. Of course they did!Below is the inside taken from the head area, from where one might clean the iron lung. The bed is rippley like a slosh of lake moving to and fro."},

I went into churches and buildings and parks, I covered some ground! No perspective to show how large this tree is in Covent garden, a person of reasonable height would barely reach the middle of the barrel.

But as luck in Spider-Man’s unit would have it, it took the thin layer of paint right off. Easy to remedy with a touch up from the left over paint. I phoned Spider-Man and asked where he kept it so I could touch up. He totally lost his mind and screamed at me, accused me of all sorts of things, and then went off on a tirade because initially I asked if it was ok to buy a broom and that still grated on him.. Spider-Man has issues! He claimed that he would now have to have everything repainted professionally and would have to find the secret recipe ( matching) somewhere in the universe and I have caused monumental horror. He did rant forcefully , irrationally. I have never been at the receiving end of such wrath and accusations.I took photos and a video to send to him , but he will only communicate through Airbnb , I don’t know my password and can not change it from here with my tiny device, so have been going through Dennis using my computer. This has proved to be hilarious as Dennis accidentally sent the wrong photo from my file….a photo of Erik partying wildly at a street party, whiskey in hand….so now I am pretty sure that Spider-Man is in a right snit, knowing that I must be throwing wild parties.This is the horrific damage-enhanced a little to make it show better for Spider-Man’s insurance. I apologized for the mistake , and apologized some more, but he just kept on screaming , basically calling me a liar and that sort of verbal abuse. Ok so now I am less sorry and if this flat fell into the sea I would not be bothered.I managed to go to an “ antique” market. A sad bear looked longingly at me . He is in sorry shape but clean. I asked Sarah if she might be able to help , to have a new patient in her Sarah hospital for the unloved. She can fix anything. So he will go to her house soon.  And there he will stay with her bear family.And for three pounds this girl because she is a darling freak.I bought lunch in the crypt, a roasted  potato with cheddar and a spoonful of baked beans and tea, cheapest lunch ! It is odd  - priorities and cash… I would rather have a cheap lunch and buy a wounded bear, I would rather top up my oyster card than go out on the town. Staying this far removed without a tube station does chip into travel and the time it takes to get anywhere. And now I am thinking that maybe this is not ideal. Only because Spider-Man has fierce issues -he sounds rational on “ paper”, as so many folks do. Just another lesson to put in the file of lessons… do not trust written words blindly. Trust first instincts and do not hesitate to change plans. Buying affordable groceries is always a good idea. Yesterday I ate four pounds worth. No biscuits! Yay, me. Especially since this flat is so incredibly pricey. I am insane.It’s all so silly and waste of drama… there are massacres happening in Gaza and , not to forget, Ukrainian still being smashed. There are american xl bully dogs being banned in the Uk, what  is the criteria to determine ? Will they also ban Olga. It’s a fine line once that comes into law and what is one to do with their beloved pet . Humans are so aggravating! A storm is on its way, it has a name but I forget what to call it… when storms have names seems that they have more power ? I don’t know, it’s really just weather, always has been but with names storms seem more like celebrities. The bbc talks about them like they are Spider-Man."},

I am glad I bought it , darkness is coming. Clocks fall back an hour this week end, just as we get our internal clocks regulated, the god of clocks trips us up by changing it to go backwards. Yesterday Sarah and I went to “Mecca”. The House Of Dreams, just an eleven minute walk from Spider-Man’s flat. Immediately the entrance gives you an idea that maybe this will be the most inspirational visit!Photos allowed before entrance to the actual house, and in the garden,which look overwhelming but nothing compared to the inside. Every surface is filled all floors are mosaic , along the walls are Stephens diary entries, his word story, his reckonings, rescues of damaged unloved dolls , broken toys and ….everything! Sarah in the back garden path. The garden was just too much to photograph, I did not try.It is a house for everyone, things speak to you, forgotten toys, curlers you nay have used as a teenager, clothing you may have worn as an infant. Memories held physically for as long as the items and concrete will hold. A legacy. The tile in this photo did speak to me, “ you can go back, but you can’t go home, it isn’t there anymore”.Taking photos does not do justice to the overall experience of immersion into Stephen’s mind . Looks haphazard but when you are right into it, it flows and works on your sense of wonder, nostalgia, repurposing and love, so much love! An exercise in appreciation for lack of control in a safe accepting environment. Stephen and Michael only open their house six days a year, Sarah’s timing and luck could not have been more perfect.. then we shopped at the second hand shop across the road, Sarah bought a beautiful cashmere duster for a fiver, on we went to the flat, on the way Sarah buys a vegan pastie. In spite of being a vegan concoction she reported that it was actually very delicious.Have a pleasant day, stay well and warm…do some art from your heart… I would love to be able to lose control on rag paper but I am stuck- years of predictability and acceptable  reserve, boring as oatmeal and hallmark. A curse upon me."},

Light enough to not bump into the wall but too dim to do anything after the sun goes down. I went to Brixton to find a study lamp. On my way I stopped at pop brixton, the railway cars that make up a community gathering place, a venue for events, many little food shops and a free food refrigerator for the hungry.  Remembering that I also wanted to go back to see the empathy museum, I walked under the rail arches to the other side and went in. It is a traveling art installation, interactive and clever A F! People have left comments on a cork board . I only snapped a couple that caught my attention.The little library was there and open, the “ Walk a mile n my Shoes” was set up like a shoe store. Sit, tell the docent your size , find a shoe that fits. Along with the shoe comes the story of the person that donated the shoes and the mile you will walk. The very large ear is of course the best tool for empathy, listening, really hearing another without your own noise competing for attention. Listening is the best skill we have.The space itself is very cool, under the arches of the railway, cleaned up , white tiles and a polished concrete floor, it is funded by various charities. It is by invitation that events are allowed the space. The empathy museum was worthy. This s the last week end. It will move on.A quick run through the indoor market and then toArgos to find a lamp. I have never been to such a store before. A lobby set up with computers and one human to show the confused how it works. On the computer you find what you are looking for and like shopping online, a bunch of options ,varying prices show up. Poke the picture to choose, pay with your card, and wait for it to appear at the desk / counter. Very efficient.75Another perfect day. Came back to the spider web . Received a great message from Erik… a you tube thing of five different philosophers and their take on being nobody going nowhere. Suits me to a “T”. I can not link to it but if you are interested this is it’s name; “The joy of being a spiritual loser: being no one going nowhere”. Unclenched! Permission to do nothing but be."},

Dungeness means “ the headland at Denge” and is made up of shingle bank, pushed eastward by waves -longshore drift. Walking on shingle is loud, and more  difficult than  sand. Maybe like walking on irregular balls of ceramic pottery or dense glass. The beach of shingle is one of the largest on the planet..All of the stones are interesting , managed to  collect a bag full , my criteria in this wealth of cool stone collecting was~ - holes all the way through-semi holes-shape-design They are weighty . Getting them home may not be an option.Houses along the shore look like toy wooden houses, lined up side by side. Fisherman’s houses are converted1920 railway coaches, small but sea and shore worthy! There have been seven lighthouses, one from 1792 has been in use as a lighthouse men’s dwelling, having only the first two stories remaining..the one n the background replaced it in 1904.Dungeness is a most other worldly place. Two nuclear power stations dominate the backdrop, operations halted in 2018 and are now in their defeuling phase. Many of the little houses are weather proofed with tar, Prospect Cottage being one. The most famous one I might add.Artist / film and video director/ writer and gardener owned it until his death, Derek Jarman was also a gay activist during the worst of gay times in the eighties aids epidemic, helped to raise awareness and funds,  compassion and sad desperation to that climate of fear, through art, films and publications. Truly a lovely human who died in his early fifties, of aids.The RHDRailway, a 1/3 mainline miniature steam engine train takes one hour and five minutes one way from one town to another making six stops along the way.the tracks are about the cutest you will ever see- 15” gauge- for thirteen and a half miles. -25 mph.Then Andy bought for us the best haddock , mushy peas and chips for lunch. Not a great photo but you get the idea of how grand a portion of haddock this was! Maple ,the orphan, found shells in my bag of stones. They are” fornicating slipper snail” shells, she tried them on for size and thinks they may be difficult to walk in, if she could actually walk…she mostly liked the name.A day well spent . Sarah is an amazing driver! Unbelievably good, winding this way and that, sussing out others drivers and their intentions, it only took a little less than two hours to get there, by bus it takes 3.5 hours. Sarah and her skills , her car , are the best news of the day! Outside a fisherman’s house, things collected from the shore…."},

I was going to go to portobello but as I was on my way to the bus the street market got all of my attention. Sun came out and everyone so friendly and happy I decided that I could not do any better. The cakes were amazing.The flowers were seasonal and gorgeous. Crab apple ( I think) full branches as well as snow berries. Need a bigger flat to do those justice. So , from the market what’s for tea?. Fresh made sausage/ leek rolls. Delicious, I want to eat sausage rolls until I die . Also for Mary Moon, my sister in Keef worship , an article in the Metro rag… not so sure about it…The final sentence says more about the writer than the coolest dudes on the planet.Anyway, on the street this was laying by the curb, wanting a home with the orphans .

{"title": "I went to church ", "date": "Friday, October 20, 2023", "text": "A good day to hop on a different bus to go into the city of London to find the oldest surviving church, year 1123. Built by a priest/ monk after he had a vision, he used slave labor and children to get the job done and what a fine job it is . His name was Rahere. He has been in that fancy bed for about nine hundred years.The statue of saint Bart holding his skin that was removed from him in typical saint torture fashion does not especially inspire one to believe in whatever religion he was keen on. No, no thank you, I will pass on that crazy torture , keep your god to yourself! Such a gorgeous medieval church tucked away in a little garden spot in the middle of modernity, busses, cars, shiny sparkling people dressed like they are magazine cover models. Well worth a visit - it even smells medieval- wood smoke and frankincense.The thing about London is that you need not go far to see something mind blowing - a bus will take you there for £2.50.. the #40 today was brand new, beautiful and electric . The only problem is the digital screen that tells you all of the stops. If you are not tech savvy you will have to be familiar with where you get off so you can push the dinger in time . Some old folks do not have access to devices , not sure why the bus bosses would do this instead of the usual , surely it can’t save that much money.After saint Bart I popped in to a handsome pub for a pint and to use the loo. As you can see, the public loo is well closed and one could be fined five hundred quid for urinating there! Just as well, pub loo was way better.The sun came out on my way back . I walked slowly making the most of it. Took a different route that was so charming I just wanted to break something. It was that good! You know, sometimes things are just too perfect! But one window on my street took care of that for me…shooting fish in a barrel… Gaza has been a prison for too long , and  now….?? No escape. Warring on one another can certainly spoil the day.

While there I did a spin around the indoor market , my favorite shop is no longer there but there is so much still to be appreciated..above is lambeth city hall, chimes out the hour and half hour like clockwork….sorry, I had to.There is a shop. Potions and lotions made by women who know things…I bought a small jar of turmeric skin cream, having sampled it and deciding it was pretty fabulous. Correct as usual…I will have to get more. This small jar will not last long given that my skin is hungry,thirsty,abused and growing old woman peculiarities that seem to respond favorably to this golden cream.Wandered on, found one of my faves but as you can see -“shut happens”.I did not go into the god shop this time. They have all kinds of cool catholic swag but they are very protective of it… the last time I went in to buy god trinkets I very nearly had to recite a catechism to prove that I was worthy. I am not even kidding! So, god can keep his sacred made in china trinkets ,saved me a few quid…David Bowie will forever be a big deal in brixton, as well as Marley, and wigs. There were three wig shops last time I was here ,now only one. The Arcade is lined with very narrow hair doing shops, weaves, braids, all of that fancy work that looks like art on her head. Really beautiful extensions sometimes all the way to the ground. Sometimes one may escape onto the seat next to you on the 37. The museum of empathy looks intriguing . I may have to go back tomorrow to see what’s up.It began in 2015 as temporary art installations that still pop up in cities all over the world. The project founded by philosopher Roman Krznarik. A library of books added to frequently by the famous and not so famous , who have loved a certain book so much that they want others to experience it too. The library is not a building, the books checked out are never returned instead are passed on to another reader. There s also the library of humans, where you can check out a real human who will either converse with you or tell you their story. I am not sure how that works… You may have heard the weekly podcast “ walk a mile in my shoes”, which is also part of the museum. There are cool things happening in art, wouldn’t you agree.I came back to the Spidey hole and fooled with the thing for Sarah.Started out with air,two pipe cleaners and a wad of tin foil. I think it may be a birthday cat…"},

They are from 1953- 1963 and are worth 75 pence each… since that is not even enough for a good cup of tea I will use them in cards or something.Postage was at that time very affordable-  12 Pennie’s to the shilling-20 shillings to the pound, now it is two pounds twenty to send even a postcard! Today I stayed here, in the neighborhood, grocery shopped and started a thing to give to Sarah for her birthday , IF it turns out better than it’s haphazard beginning. No promises.Another beautiful sunny day, though there will be a hot water bottle in bed with me tonight. Change in temperature is comfortable right now… flowers still hanging on.Stella’s birthday is today!  She sent a card for my birthday in December but I opened it today to celebrate Stella! Paper poppies! In a paper vase- they fold out and look so real!, what a cool thing! Below is a photo of my stairs , so narrow when I am carrying my bag of groceries I have to sort of carry them on my back to get by.

{"title": "Departing gifts", "date": "Friday, October 13, 2023", "text": "On Sunday I made these cards for Sally to take home, a card for each of the girls , one for Paul and one for Sally. Povvo cards for sure, recycled papers on hand pressed paper. Not a great gift as gifts go, but one made with love. Sally gave me tiny jams and tea ,biscuits and coffee from the hotel. As well as two eggs! Nearly qualifies as povvo gift, but considering how posh the hotel, maybe not….She did give me the best gifts, bless her heart. My favorite Chanel , which I rarely buy for myself! Plus the tiny books, the S/P shakers and two lunches! So generous, so un-povvo, she may need practice to be a legit povvo… what do you think, San Francisco? Chanel, delicious, I smell so nice I want to marry me!That was fun!So , that was Sally’s week , hectic , busy ,wonderful. Sent from her phone at Heathrow on her way home. Bye bye Sal, see you in January unless I can hide away in London forever…Across from the Diana memorial garden, we sat near the entrance. Quiet , white roses , leafy arches, birds singing.Sally checked afternoon tea at all sorts of places in London, surprisingly the most affordable is offered at the palace. With not just one white linen table cloth but TWO!, with generous white linen napkins and exquisite china. Ok, this will do…tiny carb loaded foodiebits and earl grey., oh yes this will do nicely.Gold flecks on the chocolate eclair. Sally went to the loo to freshen up after out trek and romp through the wilder part of the  park. It was such a relief to sit, I plopped more than sat.  Consequently ,sweat dripping, face redder than a ham, I gulped water and waited for Sal,  me looking like a melting  Mr. Toad, Probably spoiling the illusion a bit. There were four 4”x1” finger sandwiches , not of fingers  but of tasty delicate finely concocted filings. Small as we cut everything in half to share, but so so satisfying. The richness of the filling did the trick. Sally and I have had afternoon tea together at The Empress in Vancouver before and in Bellingham at the Abby, but THIS really did take the cake. Or -the scone! Of which there were two with clotted cream and berry jam, the usual. As we ate our way to the top tier, slowly we realized that less is more.  There were four delicate pastries to top off our tea. A fresh strawberry tart, a chocolate mousse biscuit thing, a light fluffy cheese cake and the gold flecked eclair. We spent about an hour and a half eating tiny food ,drinking tea and catching up with one another’s lives. We were the last to leave.asked politely to please find our way out…twice….Sally pointed out details , for instance the rounded sugar cubes, had I been a collector of sugar cubes I would have smuggled a few , now that I think of it I should have -for the orphans ,you understand.So that was afternoon tea at Kensington Palace pavilion with Sally , whom I have known since she was about ten years old and I was about 17. We did get up to shenanigans . Sally made me one of the god mothers for her daughter Anna - I have never been sure what that means other than “ love my  child as a your own” which I do, but the god thing escapes me. I would love Anna no matter what.We walked on to Sally’s  hotel , the Grand Royal whatever. Stunning place,where a mouse visited her room and ate some nuts.  Not pleased with that arrangement, sharing space with a mouse, Sally was upgraded to a room on the sixth floor ,,where a mouse could not travel. Plus she was comped for one night! The mouse did her a solid, I reckon!  From there we went to Charing Cross where Sally went one way to see a play, I went the other. That was our goodbye.on my way home it began to rain , cat that usually comes to me for a pat on the head . Sat on the bin looking at me like I must be responsible for this disagreeable weather.And this is the morning from my window. Refreshing after all of that heat and sunshine! Clearly I am a northerner- I appreciate the change .Sally is on the new Elizabeth line headed to Heathrow."},

Sally‘s mother bought her winter coat here in 1972,  Sally had in mind to buy a beret. We found a beret, wrong color, very wrong price!  We walked on…I have been meaning to see the Wallace Collection for years. The Shakespearean proprietor suggested strongly that we not miss it. He was right! We walked to the Wallace house, it is free and the objects nearly touchable but don’t touch! The tables, chairs, all extraordinary furniture in the collection are -just there, like any house, but of course the Wallace house is unlike any other. And DO NOT TOUCH! What a gem of a place! So much of it all sparkly and gorgeous. Every room has a magnificent chandelier, I can not even imagine what it must take to keep them clear of cob webs, or to light real candles and keep the wax from dripping down the crystal.At every turn some object of superior craftsmanship , something surely made by a goddess at some point in history, caught our attention and dismay. Household decoration of this calaber has been démodé for at least four hundred years, yet here it is for all to see. We did gasp! Oh man, I could go on forever , so much , but as my iPad photos are not great and because I must get on with the rest of our day I will leave this little strawberry girl with you and move on…After the dazzle we had to make our way to Kensington palace for afternoon tea. Something that was a priority for Sally “ with white table cloth”… another must! She is right , you know.We decided to walk across Hyde park as the crow flies, over hill and dale, using a faint path worn a bit by dog romps. We had to hurry a little to make our reservation in time.I will post the tea tomorrow, Sally made the reservation and paid for the tea- I have never been able to justify the cost for a tiny amount of  fancy carbs so it was never on my to do list. I was wrong, it was the best idea ever, beautiful ! So, once again Sally teaches me something that I would not have known, or done,tea at the palace , indeed! I am grateful for her having snapped me out of my Dulwich coma."},

Sally arrived the day before , got sorted n her hotel and took a nap that turned into slumber through the night- flying over so much land and sea is exhausting. From the Tate we walked along the river to parliament square and all of the insanity of too many humans . We wanted to get a closer look at “ knife edge” bronze, Henry Moore, Sally climbed over the three foot tall barrier like a sensible person, I jumped  from it , landed on my knees , like a not sensible person. I forgot that I am old. It was ok , though, a soft landing, Sally gave me a hand getting back to my feet. And we did laugh at not remembering where we are in this life. Oops.From all of that parliament touristy hell we walked to Trafalgar square, out of the swamp of steaming humanity.Luckily there was a choral group practicing in St. Martins . We listened until the finished. Beautiful , interspersed with narrative and poetry. Goose bumpy!  Stories of immigration, belonging…From there Sally went on to the national gallery , walked back as the sun was setting ,through Hyde park to her hotel.I jumped on a bus , came back to Spider-Man’s hidey hole, where I read Sally’s mom’s journal written in 1972. She was on sabbatical for a year in London , a great read, how things have changed, but stayed the same…The next day we took the city bus boat down the Thames , me thinking she might like all of the maritime history there in Greenwich. I was wrong, so we had lunch ,walked around a lot and came-back to the flat via bus. A new route for me , thanks to Sally’s Google map skills.I can not even remember what we did on Sunday, such a whirlwind when time in London is so limited! Sally only here for a week.Yesterday we went to Covent garden , walked around the area, tried to visit St. Paul’s , Inigo Jone’s barn for the Earl of Bedford, but there was a music video being made so it was closed. A man came in behind me and asked if Inigo was still there? I replied that I did not think so since he was born  in 1573 ….he corrected me saying that Inigo was only seven years old or so, for he is the church cat! ….oh….At the apple market I bought two tiny silver salt spoons, a girls head and a marmalade jar with silver spoon. Sixteen pounds spent. From there we walked to seven dials and to Neal’s yard, ate Uzbek noodles with lamb. Too much in one go so we boxed the remainder so Sally could give it to homeless on her way back through the park.a man selling some sort of publication came to our table to ask four four pounds in exchange for the magazine. We said no thank you ,because he looked like he needed food we offered it to him, he said no thank you because it had lamb in it and he was a Muslim. He was also very hungry.We walked on.I wanted to look at books in Cecil court, Sally wanted to look for a fox hunting pin. Stopping at David French’s shop with all of the antiques and curiosities stacked high.a place I have not gone into having checked the prices of items displayed in the window! No stopping Sally! In we went .sally bought two tiny collector books for me, Shakespeare , too many to choose from !  He gave us a deal, only for you”…. Right.Then he performed Shakespeare for us ,from about five different plays. He performed very well, blew our minds a little bit . A lovely character ,turns out! So, thanks to Sally, we met this man, she sorted out my Google map app, and my kitchen window, which I thought I had broken. I did not, it’s just the way the window is built. Then Sally went her way, I went mine, another day in London. Today is a day off!"},

One , to go to the box man and get another printers box and two to go to the Swedish shop to get another something to wear. The weather is heating up , a lot, for the next week or two. I only brought one linen shirt, everything I brought is winter geared… so, no choice-had to get a light cotton frock to relieve my one linen shirt. It is so tired! This man has been selling printer boxes for years , usually on portobello road, Saturday market. I am confident that I will not be going to Portobello Road any time soon, it’s too crazy crowded, so lucky for Me, the box man is in Covent garden on Mondays. Last week I bought a little tray for Keeka, for her tiny Aristocrat, the box man remembered me. Only because Keeka is memorable ,I am sure ! He asked where my grand daughter was… “ Spain” I said to his disappointed face.The cotton frock with rainbow smocking fit the bill. It will get a workout this week-when it gets hot here it doesn’t mess around.Below is the tray, very old one with little brass corners. It is the largest one I have out of three. Can’t resist, I may buy another before this gig is up, I doubt that I will be making another trip like this. My palm’s lifeline seems a lot shorter than it was  two years ago.Today I vacuumed with the silliest little vacuum. It is tiny , put it together, plug it in , and let it suck. It did the job,though awkwardly, like a toy. I washed the floors and dusted- all of this housework took me about ten minutes. Spider man has a cleaner coming in at the end of the week. She will be hard pressed to find anything to clean.  When I left home I did not want to take a tube of toothpaste in the liquid allowance bag so I got tablet toothpaste, chew them ,supposed to bubble in a lovely minty froth and be kind to the planet -no plastic…nice idea, I will tell you that they are not my favorite. Keeka saw them and agreed - she went out in the middle of the night in Vienna , all the way across town to get real toothpaste. Remember when you were a child and no one was looking ? you bit the blackboard chalk and chewed-yeah, like that. Terrible! They got rave reviews … someone got paid big time I reckon, leave a great review ,we will give you a bunch of cash because our product sucks and we have made too many! Photo just so you will know what not to buy.You may be tired of roses by now but I can not get enough, they are still clinging to summer , well except for that last one, she has had enough. Me too, hot days in London are not especially pleasant for me.At the end of the week my friend, Sally will be here for a quick time. She was looking forward to typical English weather, woolens and tweeds. Not to be.I will take her to the Tate, where the hot days are cool and the cold days are warm. A nice fix. At least the crowds in town have diminished to a more reasonable thousand. It is always so pleasing to come back to this little neighborhood. Quiet, friendly , and at the hardware store everyone uses the most endearing endearments. Everywhere actually just more so at the hardware store. I go there just to be …endeared."},

Seventeen year old boy tried to give her flowers ,she rejected him, he stabbed her in the neck .The party page, giving folks something to do while on the train or bus, thoughtful. A break from staring at a screen  , wiggling thumbs …never has been a good trend , I reckon. Science now tells us of the danger especially for the youngin’I brought along one of Joanne’s towels , and must say it is the best travel towel I have ever traveled with! Absorbent , soft and does not mind being washed every other day! It is the most cheerful orange ,especially on this first day of October. By the way, Joanne, for who knows what reason , I have been unable to leave comment on your blog. Pretty sure it is just me being tech illiterate.Norwegian wood left for the wood enthusiast passing by.On another page ,the report of the famous sycamore tree felled, sixteen year old boy in custody. The photo below is one taken of a head stone in nunhead,  either a warning or a nice way to go. “If I die before I wake…” my mom used to say that prayer at me before sleep every night until I was about eight. Not sure why she did that, not a religious woman… it scared me. Damned if I could go to sleep knowing that I might die …who would take care of the feral cats? Who would protect my doll, Bubbles, from my brother who tried to murder Bubbles at every turn. I needed to stay alive ! Miraculously I have, and Bubbles is still with me! Sorry the photos are hap hazard, that is just the way of mini iPad.  October first and all is russet, beautiful change.On their way to heaven."},

The blitz had its way with it and then a fire in the. 70’s destroyed most of it. There was vandalism ,the crypt disturbed , general destruction…the council took it over and have been tending to it for several years now, making it lovely -locked at night. Most of it is overgrown, has been classified now as a secondary forest, the largest in London proper. I will go back, now that I know the better route, I walked about four and a half miles today, being lost, turned around, ended up at the cemetery mostly by accident.One memorial that suffered from hooliganism , was the Boy Scout monument and the markers of each little boys grave, now done over nicely, in a garden of flowers that change with the seasons.The crow followed me around for a little while, left me a feather. I said thank you and held it close to my heart.It truly is a wild place, with foxes living in the recesses! The fancy grave is not only  one of the best it is for the Daniels family, makers of headstones  during the Victorian era- an advertisement! By the time I finally got to the cemetery I was very close to dying myself- walking around in circles ,no idea where I might be. I had intentions of going to an entirely different place when I started out…but that is how I do…being lost is my comfort zone.Anyway I will go back, just for the forest fresh air if nothing else. It is a quiet , forgotten cemetery , they claim, as there is no tube station nearby. People are reluctant to get lost walking for hours, I guess.Some sort of fruit growing around this happywindow.Guys on a roof.Shots on the way back, wherever I was… I remember passing by the box full of apples earlier ,only two left on my return to the neighborhood. The cemetery is actually only a little over a mile away, not the four and a half I walked!"},

The tea bags are odd, I used posca  markers to see if they worked, tea bags are porous of course,else no tea would be tea…Posca  pens are acrylic,they sort of work. Work for what, I am not  sure, maybe in collages or cards-don’t know…I have been spending more time in this cute neighborhood rather than going into the city. Low key, I love its peacefulness. Visiting with shop owners , all independent on this street, petting their dogs getting tips on what sort of art supplies might be fun to try , is how I spend my days. I bought a beautiful wool sweater from Saint Christopher charity shop. It was not cheap, brand new but affordable- much more so than going into big town to buy one. Winter is predicted to be colder and snowier than last year due to El Niño effect.so England will freeze, the pAcific northwest will be mild. Great timing on my part…still I  would rather be here and am looking forward to wearing the extra warm sweater , wooly, scratchy -Like armor.The photo is not true to the reality of deep forest green. It is so yummy! Hand knit, I reckon. A slow day, just a walk around ,a few dogs that welcomed a scritch or two. I love the little houses on the street. I have not ventured elsewhere . Will do another day-Peckham rye and nunhead cemetery Maybe tomorrow. Brickwork done a very long time ago, solid beauty! I would like one of these houses , please. Christmas is coming, wishes are sometimes granted…I’ve been good, Santa baby…gimme."},

Found the flower cart , got these enormous poppy pods plus muppet flowers for three pound fifty. As I was waiting for the bus ,a disgruntled woman sat beside me grumbling about the price of a tin of milk. “ they are not getting my money- 1.69 for one tin of milk! I can get it at Morrisies for 39 pence, I can get a tin of milk at Iceland for 50P!, these white people move in here !,, not getting my money! “ I commiserated with her and joined her in cursing the white people moving in with all their greed - nope, not getting MY money…I wore my jacket , weather looking iffy ,having sent my umbrella off with Keeka. This baby sock fell out of my folded jacket - must be Flora Jane’s. That was a cute surprise. Anyway turns out the weather was another very warm day, I baked in my jacket.Walked back along Goose Green- a more pleasant walk through - Green! Today I went in to city hub bub specifically to get Lush products. There is an awful lot of gooey fluffy product there that may make a tween girl glad, soaps and bath bombs resembling cakes and deserts on a sushi go around.And PINK! Slabs of pink. Actually the only color I found in the city today. I walked down Oxford street and Regents street in search of fashion to photo for Stella. Usually the windows are a riot of fashion… today nothing. The colors are dead the imagination day old oat meal. One major shop has covered their window with the slogan “ anything but controversy”, thus the shades of mud, dark army green and tan, sad beige, and unhappy muted dark under ripe plum. I have noticed the trend here for long skirts ,about seven inches above the ankle, with sport socks and sneakers . A sign of the times, I guess, as skirts go shorter when the nation is doing well financially, colors are a total yawn.On the bus back to Northcross there were people who actually were more alive , daring to wear color.Conversation going on behind me, two young women likely in their thirties;“ like really,like ,like ,like am I right? Like really, right, like really, know what I mean,totally like right?  “ Yeah, like it’s like you know, like really, right.”They were American, they were “like” loud…really! Feeling some measure of sorrow today. Catching me off guard . My friend died after being tortured by barbaric cancer treatments that made her final couple of years on this planet utter hell. I met her in blogworld, she came to my house three times to stay for a few days, walk, and laugh and pet the dog. We had art in common. She even brought her husband one time. That did not go as well as it could have. He was a Mormon bishop, they were one hundred percent Mormon. Loads of Mormons in my family, my patience is thin, so… they could not get out of the situation fast enough. I loved her, though and we did have a special friendship in spite of crazy beliefs.  Have a package that I meant to send to her before I left but failed… things I know she liked a lot… she died six days after I arrived here. I only just found out, had Stella send her obit. So, bummer, that really sucks, our Leenie is gone. Love goes with her."},

{"title": "Women in the granny Tate", "date": "Friday, September 22, 2023", "text": "For me, going to the Tate Britain, is like a return to comfort zone, familiarity, welcoming. When I lived on Thorne Road in my wild crazy youth, we had no heat. I walked to the Tate to not only get warm but to spend time with my favorites- Beatrix Potter and William Blake , each having a small cozy exhibit room to themselves. Both are gone now , sold off to keep the museum afloat, but Turner is still there. Turner my first art orgasmic experience . His work still does that to me-sparks flying leaving this old woman gasping! After a day of warming up was spent in the museum, back in my youth,I walked back over Vauxhall bridge past The Oval ,to the three hundred year old squat, crawled into my warm bed and wrote letters to my folks. Now I feel like the Tate is my own.. first things first, go to the toilet, wash up, get a pastry and a really good cup of tea, sit in the garden ,collect myself. I have been here for sixteen days already and am only just beginning to feel at home, jet lag this time plus the extraordinary heat/ humidity set me back. Devices and passwords , SIM card, and shoes have not been helpful either. But Timing and The Tate , a pear custard tart and tea sorted it out.William Roberts painting of a creole woman. The model was Mrs. Helene  Yelin , singer at gay venues during the 20’s. Illegally of course since ….laws. Horrendous times for folks just being who they were, and the beat goes on, it seems in some areas of the world. I have no understanding of homophobia. Such a dangerous cruel contrivance . Heterosexuality is a total mystery too. One size does not fit all. Why are humans so damned ? No one has an answer.Duncan Grant painted” the head of Eve” influenced by Picasso, using his short stroke technique -the sort of painting people walk by saying “ my child could do that in the dark with their arms chopped off”…the painting below is “ Portrait of a Woman “ by Augustus John Om, 1911, he ,knowing that she was the most beautiful, smart woman in the world, married her.they had a whole bunch of boy babies  and lived joyfully ever after.The sculpture by Barbara Hepworth, early thirties, of corsehill stone from Dumfrieshire, is utterly delicious! Spending time with lesser attention seeking works , of which there are many, getting to know the women in the museum, comfortable old Tate, my granny…I do love Fredericks work , even though it did not fit into my woman’s day at the Tate.So cool! After spending the entire afternoon indoors while the sun shone, the rain started. Reckoned it was time to go back to the flat. Walking back is a gorgeous walk as well. Especially under dramatic skies and weather. Shocked to see StGeorges wharf so built up and up!, last time here ,only four years ago, I stayed in the structure of fancy flats that look like stairs, the only other building was the cylindrical one , which at night is a sort of beacon. Wow-it looks entirely different.Came home, a little drenched , loving the cooler temp, to a dry flat and a double rainbow. Yes siree ,a swell day. Keeka will be here tomorrow , morning train from Scotland, find the flat, park her gear and off we go to the  Hunterian Surgeon  museum, newly opened after four year renovation. You know I really should be allowed to live here….pretty sure I would die glad! Dying glad is an achievable goal."},

The bus is the best way to travel, I reckon. People engage with one another, there is joy. I can take the buss to Brixton to get the tube to elsewhere if I need to. I wanted a different stay this time and this out of the way community of Spider-Man land is certainly that. Brixton was a little surprising ! Seems gentrification is on full stream ahead, which is great for Mr. Money Pants, but the character is being taken away, homogenized … seems to be on the cusp. Sad.  I went specifically to get stuff at Poundland, a much better Poundland than the one up the road here. Even that has changed from jumble of quirky goods to a more predictable shop, very tidy and clean. I used to look forward to interactions with live check out persons, now it is all machine-self check out. Boo, I say,  BOO!  The market is still good, rich with choices . Brixton has always been one of my most favorite areas. There used to be musicians on the street every day and a flower cart where I could get fresh bouquets for five pound. Not today. Most annoying difference were the Mormon missionaries hawking their cultish ways.  Ironic , as Mormons have always been a white religion, demonizing brown folks. Demonizing gays… I moved quickly so that I did not get into trouble with them. They are just kids doing as they are told. I call it child abuse, surely it is.Electric avenueFrom here I walk to goose green to catch the 37 to Brixton. My choice of place to shop. It’s a heart comfort place for me.I went into the Body Shop to get bar shampoo and ended up buying some orange blossom  spray and lavender spray for linens. Sure to improve Spider-Man’s flat. The woman who sold them to me also gave me a bottle of face stuff guaranteed to remove pollutants and make my face happy, gave it to me as a gift,! She had  a star tattoo on one arm, with five smaller stars bursting from it, “ each star is one of my children” she said. I asked about the especially gorgeous tattoo  on the other arm, “this one is my youngest daughter,my baby’s name in Arabic.” Mother and daughter went in together to have their names inked on each other. I must say Arabic is lovely , makes a fine tattoo. Self check out does not offer that sort of interaction…the tube either. People are becoming isolated in their own skin. Not a great trend.A rose on my walk home. I did bring my old hoka shoes, they bailed me out today."},

Her orphan , Racer, came along, Nat hugs her British sister while whispering to her that we are on hallowed  MARVEl ground and must behave,talk in whispers.Glad there is a Poundland on the street, great for paper products and table covers and , always, toblerone.All cleaning products are available as well as general merch, the sort you would find in the dollar store though, I noticed, that Poundland stuff comes mostly from Poland.

I feel so secure .The florist shops - there are two nearly side by side-do not compete  as one offers mostly plants and the other mostly cut flowers. Then I went to M&S for provisions and vinegar for the sofa. I am amazed at how cheap the groceries are here. A roasted half chicken-ten roasted legs and ten bbq legs all for 8 pounds.I will freeze some -that much chicken will last a while-chicken for breakfast lunch and dinner. I got a one and a half foot log eight inch wide loaf of sourdough rye for 3 pounds from the bakery/ cheese shop. Came back to Spider-Man’s place -ate marmalade on oat biscuits with tea so happy.Added the kitchen window to moleskinnotebook. Think I will watch some great programming on BBC three -mostly documentaries. Although last night, remembering that Steve mentioned a crazy program a few weeks ago called “ naked attraction” -I was unprepared ! I could not watch the entire episode for a few reasons -number one being too much shaved, pierced , baggy, weird shaped genitalia on this large screened television! Horrific in your face globs of “desire”. Leaving you with the backside of Lordship Lane or street - the Main Street the is perpendicular to this road and is also a great street, no major corporate shops -just keeping it real with small local businesses. Oh, except for a brand new Poundland! Bonus love Poundland it’s like the dollar store but fifty times better. And tomorrow is another perfectly splendid day. Might make it into city to the museum , might not.don’t mind, it is such a treat to be here in spiders flat ,I could play with drawing stuff all day."},

It is a snail and the photos are not clear. I managed to go to covent garden - the busses are compromised due to the streets being demolished I walked more that I have in three years , so my body is saying “ not today”. Saint Paul’s church is a sweet reprieve from the business of London center. Built by Inigo Jones -1631for the Earl of Bedford . Bedford owned most of the land but needed a church to make it legit in the world of Earls-ordered Inigo to build a barn church , cheaper, not so much for worship , more for “ just because”. Anyway it s so old and good vibey as churches go, simple . acquired  the nickname “ the actors church” as several actors, playwrights , and artists are buried there. I tried using the olde mini pad but it would not allow photos . I took photos of the photos and this is what I ended up with- where there is a will .The reason for going to Covent garden on Monday was to check out the antique stalls in the apple market. I bought a golliwogg . The orphans are fond of an old Dutch book about Mr. Goliwogg and two wooden dolls having thrills and spills adventure through the Dutch countryside. Lucky to find Mr. Golliwogg -they have gotten bad press lately! Also Polacks toy shop was on my list of nonsense- too expensive for my pocketbook but I did love to see their wonderful paper theaters.On the way to trafalger square to catch the mystery bus back , I bought a King coronation sammich ,out of curiosity not necessarily hungry. Looks like egg -unappealing , much like the king himself. , but it was the best,tastiest sammich ever, not even kidding. Delicious, delicately spicy-spinache,ginger, chicken other stuff on onion bread. I reckon Charles to be like this sandwich- looks bland but inside the exterior is a spicy dude! The sofa here looks clean and fairly new, but smells disgusting. Spider-Man must be aware that his sofa smells like dirty sweaty hair and crusty body, he soaked it in febreeze which makes it so much worse-gag! Febreeze should be retired to the failure pile-so nasty! Not sure how to make it better other than burning the sofa - seeking advice."},

By Saturday I will have run out of time.Yesterday Janet came over for a long overdue chat. Dennis told her that he would not miss me- business as usual....Odd, but that is how he rolls. I got a flu jab yesterday and new masks , covid is coming on strong again all around the globe. Of course it is! The airports are the worst so I will wear my hazmat attire and wash my hands every five minutes. Whatever- Covid is here to stay. At least if I get it I will not expose Dennis to  the  deadly virus, he has a pretty  strong immune system  and has been jabbed a bunch of time , ironclad. AND since he will not miss me there is no yearning to  suffer in his world, he will be just fine, unaware that I am gone. He has better things to do.... so he claims.I may \"brown\" my straw hair today, just for kicks. I have never had brown hair...Cursed blond all my life and now it is old lady straw/whitish  hair so why not change it up a bit? What next? Painted on eyebrows and LIPS? That could be a good  thing. Stepping wholeheartedly into elderly woman fashion.Adios!"},

A winter born child may be stark, quiet, able to endure life's slings and arrows, so to speak, able to handle challenges while holding breath, having been introduced to earth life in the frozen hibernal months . Tough cookies-  learned that to survive one must conserve energy - dole it out carefully.As opposed to a birth in late August , when  fruit is plump ,  sun is a bit lower on the horizon, golden, energy shifting from grasshopper days  to energetic  ant days, preparing for the frost that will come soon enough. August babies , I reckon, to be the best adapted,  resplendent ,   cheeriest disposition, quickest and smartest of all. Not especially needing to spend all of their time simply surviving - like winter babies. They advance more quickly. That is what I reckon... That would be our Flora Jane! She blew her candle out perfectly, without burning her nose! Her wish will come true.  A pile of gifts on a table,  the only one that caught her fancy was , of course, a book. Book baby, Flora. I suppose if you gave her a choice of either an ear of corn or a book (tough call) likely she would not hesitate to figure out how to get both at the same time- and why not? She is an inspiration. But I think that BOOK would be first. This is little Conrad, such a hefty name to carry  for such a smally. Bubbles and babies, an afternoon well spent and I must say that Flora's parents do know how to throw a party! FOOD!Gaiety!Babies!!So well organized, in the park where the littles could play in the splash pool - play in the playground-run around  bare foot and generally bare all over, on the fried grass next to the forested creek. Ideal!Amazing- just two years and that little charmer of a wad has become a speaking, reading ,climber of mountains ( well, at least , piano benches) How quickly two years goes by, like a blink.  Incredible!-0-Remember when we met Grand Daughter Keeka up in the hills to check out the little Aristocrat 60's trailer? She  began work on it this summer . Well..... This is it now! All new everything though there might be more to do on the inside as far as smoothing out the edges.  Hauled by her little Mini car- looks like a cartoon. This will be her home/office/ life.She will be meeting me in London for about four days- I will welcome her into the minscule flat where I will be staying. The owner is  strict about the rule that he made up re: extra person in the flat. Makes no sense at all since she will only occupy the sofa for four nights. BFD! Such a silly contrived greedy rule- I will pay him -no problem but really, the flat is hardly worthy. I suppose every pound note gained is a plus for him, living in London is expensive- to say the least.  Coming home from the party , there were two brothers in the yard, I only got a photo of one of them.  He , the least skittish of the two, carried on eating the dwarf cherry, looking at me like I was rude to intrude. I apologized and thanked him for holding still for a moment. On the sunny side of the house Dennis planted sunflowers and squash.The sunflowers are loving the location and the special attention they get from him. Rewarding him with abundance- their stalks are like tree trunks!  SUCCESS!- nearly up to the roof, birds are grateful. The yard rabbits look up  at them  regretfully ,   an earlier opportunity missed. Today is Sunday, I may go out to see  Dead Pat , in the cemetery. I am sure the flowers are crisp and need redoing. When I am a corpse I would like to be planted out there by her side, preferably in a mushroom / marigold coffin.I am reading Memento Mori, Muriel Spark, copyright 1959, \" A brilliant and singularly gruesome achievement\" -\"the mistress of highest high comedy\". All of the characters are well in their 70's and older, living (sort of) in London in their cream tea ,Grandiloquent , curtain twitching way. I have only just started the book , laughing , recognizing, delighted to be old and soon to be  in London...Timeless book! \"Remember you must die\"-"},

I have waited for weekswhile wearing my usual computer glasses, the most comfortable glasses of all, but they  are not helpful for distance. New prescription is great for distance but feeble for close- so I still wear readers along with these, to see anything close up. A compromise. I do like these. They are conservative as frames go, but after my flamboyant purchase of arty purple frames last time, I feel better about wearing these- more like a normal person. Any illusion helps. The skies have been trying to be blue, smoke is evident, sunsets are of  mercurial intensity, varying from orange to bright pink to I- do -not- even- have- name- for that color.The birds know that something is up!The raccoons and squirrels do not, they carry on as usual.Stella and I went to the harbor for lunch yesterday. They had run out of Aperol Spritz- too many summer drinks, I guess. Stella settled for a Moscow Mule.She covered my \"maybe's and what ifs\" with certain meds that in a pinch will take care of pain or anxiety- I probably won't need them but experience has taught us to be prepared for anything. For me, Venice was the worst experience. Toward the end of our stay there, I caught something intense- half of the plane ride home passengers all had the same thing- Stella escaped that one. I crawled into the house through a window because Dennis had locked me out, and collapsed for a few days, unable to breathe.It was likely due to mold and unearthed ancient bacteria in Venice after a serious flood. The air was full of killers!Had Stella not had  pain meds in her stash I would have had to be carried, half dead , all the way home!Anyway, that little squash is the only one to have made it beyond the whippy stage.Tomatoes have loved  this summer sun- Loads . What to do with them other than canning sauce? Can I freeze them? Dunno. I have eaten enough of them, sweet  and warmed by the sun, to give me an allergic reaction. Too much of a  delicious good thing.Fresca, Ms. San Francisco,  sent a little Polish girl (middle) and raccoon  to join her companions here. There was a welcoming party ! She is  sporty, keen on the out of doors life. Game for anything the orphans come up with that will not compromise her darling outfit!Ms. San Francisco  also sent a squeezable talking wild turkey for  our little Ornithologist . Flora did fall off of the piano bench and cut her head a couple of days ago- went to the doctor and got glued back together, literally! First bloody nasty injury  to have happened in her young life! DANG, get used to it, Darling, welcome to gravity and life on earth.Today I will unpack  and repack with  less shite. Subtraction! I can do that! When Mary Moon asked \"what are you very bad at doing?\" My first response was math! I went through  three universities before I found one that did not require traditional math as a general ed. requirement. Whew, I could graduate finally, took a while! \"Forth time is a charm\", is the correct saying. Numbers are not my friends - but I can subtract and because of the visuals I  did do  fairly well in geometry. By fairly well , I mean- I passed.On to the task of the day- elimination. I see a blue patch in the smokey sky- All is well."},

See her nipple? Impressive!Em has asked that I make 24 cupcakes for Flora's big time birthday party,  to be held in the park  because too many people were invited. OK, no problem- other than the fact that cupcakes are  poison- sugar flour more sugar...I tried to find alternatives but really there are none.  I also gave my cupcake/muffin pans back to charity shop, knowing that cakes and such are a thing of the past due to sugar awareness. I ordered aluminum cupcake cups and they came overnight. Healthy alternatives are not in the cards - I will just make the usual grandmother yellow cake ( a really good recipe) with  heavy cream icing, I guess.

Happy  and naive. Colored too brightly, petals too simple. A joyful flower!Another joyful successful flower,  pink carnation , keeps pumping out lovely little edible blossoms - throws us into the nostalgia of a white sport's coat  days. Glad I got this plant two years ago- it has been rewarding. Best flower of all, our Flora. Granny day last Tuesday was likely the last before I split.  She will grow so much during the time I am gone - to be sure and may forget me entirely.  She loves birds and bird activity, a baby Ornithologist- already knows that a flock of pigeons is a \"kit\" and that eagles are solitary.  This knowledge coming from her Dolly Parton book of which there are many. Brilliant program that Dolly set up \"Imagination Library\".Flora would rather read books than just about anything, She is so smart at age two (in another week) that she leaves us all gobsmacked. Jaws drop! Plus her disposition is mature, calm, sensible, studious- holy cow, where did this child come from??? Speaking of SMART, this two hour long discovery - \"Alzheimer\" but I think that word  is just to get folks attention, as well as the dramatic front page-   if you actually settle down and watch/listen to this program, you will see that the content is deeply  more varied- evolution being a large part. It may be better to absorb incrementally, it is packed and lengthy but easy for the layperson to understand the science. Do not be fooled  by the \"Before it's too late\" urgency- that is too sensational for the scientific  content. Not meaning to be didactic, really , just filling in my own  gaps. Looking for my own answers in the great OUT THERE- and thought it of importance enough to post.-0-I arrived an hour early for my tetanus injection yesterday , luckily I was right across a couple of streets from the thrift store, the one that I do not like anymore- it is corporate...anyway, killing time I caught and released a few things- an antique hammered copper ladle, a child's chair, a vintage tin, melodic bells-  only a few photos of weirdo stuff came away with me .This being one.Cottage painting on wood from the 70's with additional text on the apron. Would have gone unnoticed but it was on top of something of interest. I imagine that this little maiden has escaped  a patriarchal cult and now has a real  mission, though ill advised.The doll bin was full-Noting that Miss Italy and Miss France are identical and Miss Scotland could be from anywhere on earth. The entire box of mystery dolls of the world was $7.00. Below Miss Ill-fitting Green Dress has an elastics problem.Also, it seems, that old dollies from far off lands, have newly  discovered  dime store make up and are not  yet skilled in its application.  Lipstick sometimes reaches the ear or  nose area. This one may have a swollen lip on one side - her application  follows the lump. The so- called- Indian nose has been covered by sticky tape, I did not check to see if that was  for prevention of breakage or if that was to hold together an injury. Thrift stores , are  entertaining- how items are placed next to one another and what sense it makes. (?) What were people thinking when they bought that item in the first place. The chalk pig cookie jar probably came from Hested's or some similar dime store and cost maybe 50 cents initially.  I would have bought it for 50cents and used it in the yard as a planter.Leaving you with a most  gorgeous flower, the face of wonder and delight!Our Flora. She sees all! AND she knows  all about birds and rocks , but never in the same sentence... Her sense of humor more sophisticated than the usual slap stick at this age. My god!

We are a good team. Trudy \"gets\"  dark humor, Mary not so much, Mary is all light and love and goodness- I am opposite and Trudy just rolls with the flow.  I suggested that we all get  tattoos to \"bond\" our friendship forever, something Wyoming like the  bucking Horse (found  on every license plate ), his name is Steamboat, I thought it would be good one!- No takers- in fact they were horrified ( as if I would ever get a tattoo anyway, just testing the waters, but you know if they had agreed I  would jump right on it....) Trudy suggested the blood brother thing where fingers are pricked and blood is mingled but, nah, that is too forgettable. So we left that idea in the tip. We will meet again after I return from the big deal trip to London which is giving me a bit of nervous anxiety and will do so probably until I board the plane. On Wednesday I will get two more jabs- pneumonia and tetanus at the same time.  I may be an unpleasant person the next day.

In the past we have had a pretty much  free and open border, until terrorists and drug folks  and covid started their hi-jinx. Prices are better here  than in Canada, and there seem to be more  choices . When it was the other way around, we went to Canada on  a monthly basis.  Great for little kid christmas shopping as we could buy the Rupert annual and KINDER surprise eggs with quality German made  toys inside- Roots boots and woolens , British  and French goods . Homogenization and \"Made in China\" slowly took a lot of choices down to zero. Why bother going across the border now?  Well- the beauty of the country for one-  and  the smuggling of , illegal in the states, KINDER eggs - still enough reason.   For the most part it is  easy, border waits minimal and the dollar is good.  Bellingham  Cost Co  , for Canadians,  is cheaper. Canadians have flocked to Bellingham once again. Primarily from Vancouver, where driving a car is like a weapon in a war to get there first at all costs- cutting others off, horn honking, breaking speed limits, aggressive. So much traffic from Canada this summer. I think twice before going out and when I do I am careful to choose a time that will be quieter. ( Or so I think) There really is not a time better than any other.This is an article re: problems in the grocery.And @ Trader Joe's. In the past Hindu's from the large community up north have come down to Cost Co to purchase ALL of the milk, I mean ALL, to use in ceremony that  the  Gods require . If I had to choose a religion I would choose one whose gods were more fond of Gin and tonic ,  whiskey,  chocolate, anything other than milk! Anyway....-0- When I was six, my Dad piled us into the car, a little camper trailer behind,  scooted  us off on a very long/far road trip. We made a circle- Wyoming,Colorado,Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, Wisconsin,Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and back to Wyoming, camping all along the way in the little trailer. A memorable trip to be sure, for all sorts of reasons but will leave that , and move on to the next long road trip years later when we went to Canada. I guess it took several years to recover from that \"practice\"  trip. I found this old photo- My folks took  my friend and me on this trip - she was sweet and polite, balancing my bratty  behavior, somewhat.  That was the plan... We entertained ourselves pretty well in the back seat while my Dad drove like a ten year old,  having zero  driving experience, chain smoking with the windows up. We were about fourteen or fifteen , conversations all about  dreams of the future.  Applying nail polish - fumes adding to Dad's  cigarette smoke and mother's Mentholatum and Shalimar . Toxic car!This trip was also a wide circle, from Wyoming through Montana, crossing the border, bagpipers  in kilts welcoming us with  screeching  and  packets of oat biscuits and  maple leaf sweets, utterly charming.   Up through Saskatchewan, where Dad ran a bicyclist off the road on a bridge.   Banff and Jasper Alberta, next. If you have never been there I swear to you it is the most amazingly gorgeous bit of earth you will ever experience!  Put it on your calendar. Lifted this photo from the internet: the little town in the Big mountains- but so much more!! Though it was summer time and the gardens were extremely lush , the mountains  still snow covered,  air so fresh it slapped us silly! I hope to go there again, with a better driver , one who does not chain smoke with the windows up and take corners at break neck speed. From Alberta we traveled on to British Columbia, SOOO  gorgeous. I love the north and have thought , more than a dozen times, that I would like to  call Canada \"home\"- eh?  Best of the Rockies. Still a possibility, I am not dead yet.We crossed the border into Washington state ,  American flags this time, and uniforms- no tunes, no biscuits, no sweets, just - business.Through Washington and Oregon, I made a vow to my friend that if I could not live in Canada I would live in Washington when I grew up-   (vow kept!) While in Washington we met  uncles  and some of  Dad's friends from Texas @1962 world's Fair in Seattle. Spent most of my time in the food fair eating strawberries , clotted cream and scones. The land of tomorrow , Century 21 theme- was curious and by the time twenty years rolled around, they  promised ,  every household would have a landing strip , a flying machine of some sort for daily transportation, and  phones with television so that you could see the person you were talking to-   terrible idea.  Did that mean that we would  be even more self conscious - comb  hair, apply Tangee,  every time the phone rang?  Ewww , NO , bad idea.  What if just out of the bath or on the toilet? Just NO.The international Pavilion entertainers from all over the globe, danced interestingly , extravagant costume, singing their cultural songs, intriguing, my fave! Tickets for the fair for  three days plus rides on the sky train- $1.80. Dennis remembered that he had been there as well -  sparks would not have flown had we met.  I was barely out of childhood and he was a grown-assed  hairy man in the navy.  He remembers being  enthralled with the science and electronics and promise of a jazzy gadget filled future , does not remember the scones or the cultural events. Ramble ramble- anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, Canadians buying/hoarding all of Bellingham's groceries....traffic, open border, covid gone (?). If I were not going to London so soon I would consider another road trip up into beautiful Rockies of Canada, or take the four day  train  journey across  Canada - only costs $5,000.00 one way.... a sleeper with  fine dining, mind you, but that is a  lot of dosh! Another day, maybe, next life time...-0--take away -    be   considerate humans,  don't be greedy, especially in another land, don't drive like my Dad (or a Vancouver BC driver)  Americans are notoriously unskilled at  basic ways to be. Canadians are generally not rude , at all, but things change, as you know- American's are not a model, do not follow. Stay kind, Canada. ( through my wind shield on the way to get leftovers at the grocery- American way  to go to the store,  bigger is better- changing way too slowly.  Ridiculous country. do not emulate.)Ramble on....."},

Walkable, low key, before tourists arrived. The beaches are mostly little kid friendly. We swam with a  sea turtle gazing up at us- I thought I would die of awe. We did a few touristy things but mostly just enjoyed the days of Hawaiian magic. Closest thing to  opium I have experienced...Dreamy, swaying.We stayed in Paia the last time, when Dennis lost his mind due to diabetes and mass brain fog/confusion. He is so much better now. In spite of that, Erik and I went to the beaches every day. There were five of them lined up like choices at the carnival, which one to choose today, each having it's own personality. All of them friendly and laid back. these guys look like they may be having a very casuaLl business lunch. The days on Maui were delicious. The air sweet, flowery, and salty , the sun , soothing not harsh,  soft, Maui is soft...Perfect in every way. The natural food shop in town had everything we could ever want- checked our food out  next to Owen Wilson, everyone just said\" Aloha,Owen\" or \"Yo, Brah\", did not treat him any differently than any other local. Willy Nelson has a bar down the street. he was not there and the bar kind of sucked but we had to go because...WILLY!Maui, ignoring the  tourist shite, is all about community, There are several sweet little towns north of Paia, all of them in the way back machine. Slow and charming. Old wooden buildings - businesses that have been there for generations. If you want to buy eggs, on the honor system, leave a dollar in the box- Avocados?, slip your dollar under the door. Take what you need, mahalo.Devastated  Lahaina has burned to the ground -   people have died. Jumping into the ocean did not save them.

Wild carrot, on the other hand, is just a pretty thing with a fancy hat and sticky promise.

The warehouse looks like a vast empty refrigerator. Starvation zone.Peckish we went to outside cafe where we like to gather seeds from the hollyhock on the corner.  Never any luck growing them from seed but we are slow learners. someone has put a bird feeder in the middle of the Russian sage , growing there manically! Mine is not nearly as successful. A perfect summer day, temperature at about 68 degrees. Stella telling tales of Finland and planning her next trip.  You know, IF we live that long!

Lighter weight, easier to handle with a \"safety feature\"...Also marketed to grannies whose strength may have deteriorated- arthritis or general muscle weakness. don't you just know that my Wyoming relatives would be the first in line to arm their babies? Thankfully -followed on youtube,-John Lewis Christmas ads.

Flora Jane is back from their trip to Italy- screamed the entire flight, poor baby! Anyway, Emily , being such a fabulous Mom, did not murder her baby and when they got to their destination everything chilled out, except for the temperature of Italy - Scorcher! Flora is so much fun to play with! she did confiscate my phone and took this selfie as well as pushing mystery buttons and things that I am unsure about. She has so much confidence in all things!The best days are spent in her company- she taught pebbles the ABC's and how to count to fifteen. Rocks and pebbles are the best students!This baby girl is a no nonsense genius  baby! She owns the day! So smart it is dumbfounding - in awe, I try to keep pace but , hahaha, no chance, granny Linda Sue, no chance! This kid's on fye-rahw!The neighbor guy has been putting  his art  out along the road again...Over it, especially since the latest \"works\" are seriously not worth mentioning...but here I am...mentioning."},

What was I thinking? I dunno, desperate times??They would have been nice to have if , say, I was a doorman, or a musician in a swing band...Speaking of:After the Barbie movie Stella and I went to the pub for a bite and to listen to Lorna's band- music for old timers. The drummer, a tiny man, resembling spider monkey dressed in blues bros. influence, counts the band down - A one,two three four- in a voice  like  Roventini's \" call  for philip morris\", high and squeaky. All in all very entertaining, accomplished musicians. Solo from the orange haired person was right on- R-E-S-P-E-C-T- belting believable Aretha with heart and soul.  \"Roll out the Barrel\" sing along , not so much...Bumped into some old friends from the boat days when I was 24. Returned to the car before the crowd  to find a ticket on the shield.There were no signs to say how or where to pay for parking- all intentionally vague because SCAM! The ticket was $41.00 and would be jacked up to $78.00 if not paid within 15 days. Stella took photos of the vague nonsense sign and we grumbled a fair bit. Got home and looked up Diamond Parking, sure enough- we are not alone. It is a scammers delight! Stella will send them their three dollars, a letter and a copy of the vague sign, and be done with it.  I am sure that people not as savvy as Stella are duped into the payment. These are the electronic devices going to London. Compact! Two Ipads one phone and one charger, plus the cord, of course and the adapter.Two inches by 8\", takes up less space than the bag of liquids. Money being what it is will be measured carefully- a povvo holiday costing quite a bit because of the length of the stay. I can do povvo pretty well. I reckon the only reason to take my big camera point and shoot would be for the zoom feature and is not worth it really. What am I going to do with a ton of photos anyway?August will fly by and I will be in the sky so quick! The trip is already so damned expensive before I even get off the ground, you know how it is - the dollar is not fairing well and well...London, most expensive town on the planet!  Packing now to see what I can eliminate- I can get by with lots of underwear, I suppose and fewer shirts/ leggings/frocks.Off we go into August- gone in a blink!"},

Nematode Barbie would have been appropriate!Stella has returned from Finland- we will go tomorrow to see Barbie again. After the initial bold pinkness, bright plastic color,  and hilarity of the patriarchy, the dust begins to settle - appreciation of the genius of the movie becomes evident.

Perfect evening, Jacket cool.I left them at the park and walked home at twilight so by the time I reached the house it was dark.  It is only a mile and a half but I am slower than sunset. When the light goes out it goes out boomph!Deer relaxing in the yard were  startled and took off  ten inches before my very self- the thunderous herd freaked me out! I can't see for beans so anything coming out of the dark like that is an \"oh shit\" moment!Came home to blessed empty house- quiet.  Took a photo of the  very olde baby bottle that Erik brought for me. It says \"Happy Baby\"- but the baby looks not happy. Erik knows me well. I want my old face to freeze into a jolly happy  face so better start practicing if it is not too late already.

She has diplomatic skills, so.....I took advantage. Outside the cinema is a man made puddle- a pond,  but  really a large  puddle. It is a nice enough area, playground , short walk around the puddle/lake/pond, and a couple of places to get food. The cinema is large- by large I mean more than one screen...This is Bellingham after all...The  BARBIE movie is hilarious, ends on a rather cornball note but that is just me, probably. If I were Barbie - and knowing what I know about life in the real world, I think my decision would have been very  different and there would be no corn. -0- This morning Ernie greets me  with  \"Please Sir, Can I have more\".I comply and give her a good tummy rub as well. She likes buffalo biscuits more than a tummy rub- backs up , and tells me , politely- no thank you , please just another biscuit will do.Pretty sure this is the very end of the poppies, They have lasted beyond their \"best by\" date, as have I. Another couple of days of lovely solitude, making the most of it by turning off gadgets and trying to freeze my face into a permanent grin. Will it work...Probably not.

Sunflowers, same- yesterday one sunny face, this morning, many. Mid summer already-a lot of the flowers are spent.Time to shift from spring summer on the deck , to autumn, marigolds , chrysanthemums ,  sunflowers and volunteers from the bird feeder .Family is going over to the island for the annual week on Orcas. I will stay here again and have the house to myself- get things done, pack up my studio shite- put it all in bags and cupboards, I suppose, maybe...maybe not...I may just - be quiet in alone time. Ahhhhh, yes.There is a memorial service today that I ought to attend but will I? Probably not.He was the step dad of the four girls I lived with when I was young. We were a gang of sisters .He came in rather late in the game. He was a good soul but we were not in the mood for a caring good soul at the time, renegades that we were.I am not keen on memorials and funerals so much, unless it is an episode of \"Six Feet Under\" , which I could not get enough of. I guess it is a closure thing, a for-the-living- comfort thing but really- the guy was well into his late nineties and I did not know him well. That is my rational.The first funeral I ever went to has been a sharp, clear memory. I was 12. The girl who died was an icon in my mind, she was in high school and as sweet and smart as  cherry pie. I admired her so. she tripped while carrying her little niece across Brush crick, either she hit her head or she had a heart issue, we were never quite clear on that- anyway she drowned in eight inches of water as a result. I went alone , wore a black taffeta dress  that my mother bought for me to be appropriately attired. It was a lovely dress and I only wore it that once. The funeral was  as funerals go- open casket , a young girl \"sleeping\" on satin cushions , songs sung , words about a better place...all of that- nothing registered with me. I don't know what I thought it might be but that was not it.  I expected a jesus miracle- the dead shall rise sort of deal. I don't know what happened to the black taffeta dress that pleasantly kept me entertained during the service. The sound of taffeta is called\"scroop\" an 18th century word blending scrape and whoop together. The sheen of the fabric catches light in various waves that look like pools of ink sloshing about. I played with my dress, heard very little of what the god man was saying , saw so many sad and weeping faces, decided right then and there that funerals were not my jam. Nothing miraculously worthy of my new black taffeta or \"Love divine , all loves excelling\" sing along....-0-Ernie has been here twice already this morning. Biscuits  given, slobber  drooled, tail wagged. She is such a sweet little dog. I gave her a hug and a kiss which she tolerated- the price one must pay for buffalo biscuits. When I tell her how lovely she is she puts her ears flat to  skull and humbly accepts the compliment, wiggling all over.  -0-I have been bringing the flowers in to place on the table. Fragrance and cheeriness indoors. Soon they will all be spent so may as well scissor them off and stick them in whatever is handy to admire.  Little  blue and white pitcher, from AL yesterday for $3.00, looks like Cornish ware but is Stafford-shire.  Easy to tell the difference really but who could turn down a lovely little striped pitcher like that?

Big sister and dad coaching her- I hear a WHOOP! \"You're doing it!!\" Off she goes! Four years old!I think that everyone remembers first day of learning to ride a bike- we did not  use \"training wheels\". When Erik learned he did not have them either but we did go to the freshly mown  grass in the park- a soft landing while getting used to gravity and balance. I learned on  asphalt  that circled around the block of neighboorhood houses - going up hill was fine, leveling off was fine , coming down hill?- not so fine. Dad forgot to mention the brakes...Bonked and bloody , having sped into the curb to stop- I flew over the handlebars. Dad carried me home in a heap, Mom stuck some band-aids on my wounds, I took a nap.  Dad got scolded. I was five - a big girl on  a big girl's bike. I have mentioned this adventure before I do believe.On the bike the very next day - it became part of my anatomy. Freedom! That bike stayed with me until I was 32 years old, the only bike I have ever had. Memorable rides- summers of adventure- going to forbidden parts of town, out running ferocious semi-feral packs of dogs. I would still have that bike, but I left it in my friend's garden shed to watch after it while I traveled...failed- who knows where it ended up?

Their fragrance revives everything good in one's  memory bank. Drama from the starry night petunia. We appreciate their imagination and artsy nature. The blue pansies are in awe leaning against the petunias, either for shade or out of admiration/inspiration.

So well blended in with the forest there by Pat's  that I had not noticed it before. It is lovely and would certainly get approval from Pat if she were not so dead.I took two  favorite river stones to mark the spot , also something Pat would appreciate. One fits perfectly within the other, resting, holding  one another comfortably.This is daisy season and shastas are everywhere smelling like -too-long- worn sweaty socks.

I am following the story line which is silly and hilarious, Dennis gets hung up on the swears. It is like getting snagged by poor grammar  not hearing the tale told-  \"language offends me\"...sort of deal. I say If one is indeed offended by swears to examine where and why that was a learned offense. There you have it- an opportunity to question and to grow beyond one's \"offense \"  and judgy limitations. Is it a control issue of how to be? Not sure...Anyway Loudermilk has few redeeming watchable moments but it is hilarious in  dark humor genre. Badass attitudes not even remotely based in reality of the human condition...why would it be? If Dennis produced a series it would be with proper grammar , zero swears, actors delivering lines succinctly void of emotional investment, beige set , beige clothing- would it be a success? Possibly- to fundamental Christians. This is my  first sunflower, defying gravity, straight up into the sky, on slender legs. How does she do it? Sunflowers are magic. Speaking of, I watered Pat's flowers out at the country cemetery day before yesterday. I also took some large smooth stones out to mark her grave. As I placed the stones fitted to one another in such a cool mother-nature way, a large Monarch butterfly flitted past my hand, landed on a rust colored flower, (Pat's favorite color) paused but not long enough for me to take its photo and then disappeared.First and only butterfly I have seen in these parts for about six years."},

Then it clicked. This is a first!Sentimentality does not interfere with  real life . So says us.We went to the harbor and ate fishes , in the wind and chilly temperature - so good to be outside even though I had to have two cups of coffee to stay warm.  It is NOT raining or snowing , it is good.Earlier in the day I went to Assistance league , got another damned basket, some one stop me! The tea towel is from Kew Gardens and the calligraphy on a T-shirt was done by an old friend,  teacher of all things Chinese back in the day. I recognized his calligraphy immediately.

Only eleven of us showed up which was a bit surprising but I guess when one has lived 96 years most of one's friends have already died. Small group - just the closest friends attended. Four of them immediate family, so , not bad. Pat was not religious, a critical thinker for the most part. Her daughter-in -law's  bible banging husband took charge and tried to set the tone, it was done so in typical arrogant condescending fashion. Preaching, he was  preaching at we, who  are all on the same atheist's page,   as though we were his flock. It was all I could do to employ my ever waning  filter, and not throw my shoe at him.  However, after he was done, the ceremony over, I did say to him that His god can take a hike, there's a new girl in  town and in charge- Pat has arrived\"  Also during the \"tell stories about the dearly departed\" I may have over stepped  a bit...But we all agreed that it was Pat's way or the highway, in a good natured way. I put two cough drops in with a potato along with the other people's stuff, photos and poems. Cough drops because of Pat's incessant cough and the potato because Potato is all we could afford to have for dinner back in the day- we did not  have a dime to buy a cuppa. Not even exaggerating- potato was free.  DIL brought one of David's little paintings back for me, one that always made me laugh, one of his first when he became ill. It  hung in his kitchen by the door, and now it is in my kitchen by the door. Since i was out and about I went by my Janet's house to see what she had been up to. New roof, new house painting, new back yard , cleared out rooms, getting ready for the next adventure, living elsewhere.She unearthed this coat that was her mother-in Laws back in the 70's.Mohair, long, warm, lovely teal and fits me like it was made for me!I love it, Nothing like wool especially mohair , in inclement weather. Rain? No worries. So I am thinking to take it with me to London instead of my plastic coat. Too much? Too hairy? Too beautiful?? I don't know- vintage wear may not be London style but then I have never been stylish, and who the eff cares? The lining is shot so may have to patch or replace. Not sure how to do that- just the bottom part of the lining has been eaten. Any suggestions? Please?I looked up the maker of course, as I have never heard of them/him- their vintage mohair coats are all gorgeous IMO. Bright colors! I do love this coat. Dennis reckoned that I would have the bus to myself if I wore it, too \"homeless bag lady\",  too hairy....Janet also gave me a large bright yellow gold shallow bowl, great for all sorts of reasons- bright color being one. An onion the size of a large person's fist may give it perspective and one of Joanne's towels folded in thirds. Cheerfully YELLOW in the glaring light of the kitchen.Stella is in Helsinki at the moment, catching up with her dead relatives and going to the charity shop around the bend.  Flora Jane is in Tuscany running through churches and ancient stone streets, bells ringing. She will be having her second birthday next month! She knows everything already, that child. When she comes back she will undoubtedly be speaking fluent Italian. There are red heads in the tree and at the feeder, and Pat's still dead... We are  getting there-  a gaggle of old folks! The other Linda in the polka dots next to me is the one who led us in a rousing  \"negro\" spiritual, she said- in her all too white way, \"I'll fly Away\"- I did not sing  it, I hollered it . Everyone  a bit taken back, I am sure, as I  belted out this song ,out of tune, in my all too white way- the god folk- so righteous  they could not intuit how utterly ineffectual and embarrassing  they might be.  Anyway, that is that- my little rebellion also ineffective and most certainly embarrassing - probably, just made everyone go home a little more deaf. \"O'Glory\"!!!!"},

Worn alone or over your good clothes to protect them from the daily work of house and home,garden and engine overhaul.Practical, I must say. My mother had bright, happy ones - she sang all day and sometimes danced alone in the kitchen while fixing lunch for me before school began again. I walked home for lunch and walked back, even through the blizzards and knee deep snow- wind howling 50 miles an hour, for a bowl of Mom's vegetable soup.  Does that sound like the typical old lady story about \"when we were kids we had to walk uphill both ways, barefoot through broken glass ?\" THIS is a great beginning to J.C.

Now I have boots for winter in London that I think will be good in the rain and snow. The bouquet is for tomorrow's get together at the cemetery. Pat's son and daughter in law arrived from Calif to dump her ashes in with Kenny, Pat's other son who died , when we were all 24 years old,- brain aneurysm. I have never been out to Kenny's grave . All these years- I do not feel that he is there really, just a little bit of grass under many trees, a natural burial back in the day, coffin made by friends out of scrapped pine, decorated by friends, no headstone, just grass and trees. Anyway, I went to Joe's garden - snap dragons and lavender, used some of my sweet peas, but had no way to contain it all to leave at Pat's so called \"resting place\". I went to the $1.25  store ( note , it is no longer the dollar store)  and bought a plastic pitcher, ditched the lid, bought dotted hessian and hessian ribbon, a little chalk board and put together something that will hold the flowers nicely, at least for a couple of days. I wonder what grounds keepers do with things like this that are left behind to weather and become trash, as they do. The moleskin booklet I collaged a little bit, not done yet. It will be my address /passwords /info and sketching book to take with me, along with my dandy boots. Guess I have everything needed now.Five LBS of me have gone- in one week. How can this be? Keto and lots of water so If I keep this up, which is not likely, I may be able to fit into the tiny airplane seat  over the Atlantic by September. Feeling better, more energetic. For the past three years I have been adverse to KETO just because it sounds counter productive , possibly dangerous to heart and arteries, but , you know , desperate times- desperate measures...Science now claims that keto is the only way to eat, or at least a modified version, maybe 20 carbs daily instead of the usual carb heavy diet of America. Fat is our friend, carbohydrates are a false friend. And J.C. Penney has been a consistent friend. We still have one in this town of \"everything gone to the dogs\", at least we have that."},

There is one shoe shop that carries \"sensible\" shoes. However they were not sensible enough and I came away empty handled. I passed this guy outside the \"tasting Room\"- I was not compelled to go in to try tasting what ever is on offer. I walked over the cross walk,  to the art store which is fabulous in every way! If you need it they sell it, caught up with the owner, an old friend- our boys went to school together, and we are so on the same page about leaving the country for- EVAHHHH...though he is more practical, getting duel citizenship organized for himself and his son. Loads of paper work, waiting, records - bahblah. but really getting it all in gear, seriously. I bought a travel palate and an eraser. I may use the eraser to erase Seattle upon take off...I may leave the space needle intact, because it is so  cool. (the alley) The bouquets offered from this, my favorite flower shop, are mostly wild flowers and artistic displays , unusual and absolutely lovely, like the sort you might find on the street in Paris. Flowers are damned pricey, even in flower season- but they do put a lovely stamp on their arrangements, skills!And then surprise!! I have not been downtown for a long time and this little place has  popped up! PUPPIES in the window- the one's with the waggily tails! I peered in and saw every human on the floor surrounded by litters of little squirmers - It is a find your forever home sort of deal- potential owners are vetted and the little canines are well taken car of, socialized and bathed. SO damned tempting- walk on, I urge myself- walk on- don't look back.Today  \"getting my vehicle tuned  before I travel project\", I went to the eye doctor, She  was amazing! Tattooed , an artist as well- taking the place of my old doctor with his blessing.  The most thorough exam I have ever experienced in the eye dept. Not only looking deeply into my windows of the soul but all the way back to the beginning of time.  Getting a new prescription of course , old eyes- getting older with every waking moment. Not totally blind...yet, but getting there.(The flower shop in Paris. You will not find carnations and roses in this shop unless they are exotic and French.) Flowers growing on the deck in the breeze this afternoon, they are gleeful. They are pleased to NOT live in Paris, from everything I have told them about the stinky city (Paris, I am not a fan...) mine have become grateful for their pots.There were four rolly polly babies on the deck this morning batting the sillies right out of the dangling flowers. The nasturtiums take a beating for some reason the babies are amused most by them.  Maybe because, to trash bandits , they look like trash?"},

I am sure she knows where it is. she also brought with her lots of hairs and detritus from the yard, not that anyone would notice- it is not like I am Ms. Fastidious Suzy Homemaker... Ernie likes to nap on the cool tiles of the entryway- I like seeing her there. I called the doctor as requested. After four days of wondering and speculating - working out in my mind how to get rid of stuff because surely I must be dying- thinking of death with dignity and blissful drugs to ride out on...She only wanted me to call back to tell me that my POOP was negative.  Another reason to never go to a doctor unless your neck is broken or you are bleeding from a gaping wound that can not be stuck together with duct tape or super glue. Even though my visit just  to be sure that I am travel worthy was free- it still cost me 11.70- break my piggie bank!Anyway all is well- during the wondering four days I became curious again about what happens to the brain when one is checking out- or recovering from surgery or trauma- that out of the body experience one has- that sort of blissful state of \"it's all gonna be awright\".As coincidence has it on NPR this morning - this:GREAT, brain and science comes through yet again with explanations.That blue section which is difficult to research because it is tucked way in there - the Precuneus.That little sausage is responsible for dealing with trauma, bless it!It is also responsible for disassociate personalities , as a result of dealing, coping. Life can be one big trauma for some and the only way the brain can survive is to alter perception for the body it lives in. General anesthesia is one of the most common ways to trigger the Precuneus.  Drugs like our favorite wad of Opium from the mountains of Nepal...is another way, little wonder why I did appreciate it so.Out of body feels rather nice.So, out of body is real but not ,maybe, what we reckon it to be-  not a spiritual adventure,  it's all in the brain , as all things human are , it would seem.  Euphoria and visitations from another glorious world are brain chemicals, sausages and neurons going to work for us in times that we may find challenging.  BRAINS!!! little wonder why it is on every zombie menu.So, that was some cool info this morning as I waited to hear from the unnecessary doctor . Not sure I buy it entirely, I mean about the brain taking all the credit. There are happenings that can not be explained so readily - still on the fence about intuition/dreams/ foretelling- that sort of thing, not in a woo-woo way , mind you. Here come the berries! No brains- yet here they are! PS. I am trying the keto diet just to see...I will tell you that the feeling of keto flu is real. I feel like poop on a stick."},
{"title": "hair enlightenment, a GI Joe wedding, possible flags", "date": "Monday, July 3, 2023", "text": "About 39 miles north, counting the miles of being lost,  it should have been 27, I drove to get a hair balancing. From her front gate on Drayton harbor the Canadian Rockies loom above the harbor, where the tide is so far out it looks like the surface of  a neighboring planet. I knew that I would get lost so I left at 11:30 for a 1:00 appointment. The location is marked only by a blue fire hydrant in the grass by a dirt road that goes to her house. The gate is the first clue about how this balancing might go, the second clue is the log labyrinth in their clearing. The property is beautiful!Nearly a two hour balancing ,which entails every strand of hair cut in a precise angle to go with the natural flow of one's own personal hair growth. She is a hair scientist, gets to know you and your hair during a chat before beginning- a short meditation , her hands resting lightly on your shoulders to center herself, to focus. We talk easily as though we have known each other all our lives.  Some of our conversation so heart felt deep  - we both came away enriched with life's amazing whatevers, gasping at the wonder. Having  a hair balancing, the cut lasts a long time and the hair grows out nicely, I will not need another hair cut for about a year. I want to go to her sooner than that though , the experience was so...important!-0-Earlier in the day, before my first cuppa- there was a wedding on the table. Erik had left behind some GI Joes, the Orphans decided that a wedding might be just the thing.  There was a surprise ambush in the flower pot....then a surprise proposal.some \"I do's\" and some wishes, photos taken, and there was cake. Mud cake!GI Joes are so cool . Dolls for girls are limited physically but \"action\" dolls for boys can do all sorts of things with their bendy ways! They are made well, the real GI JOES with the thumb mark-  are jointed everywhere there are joints in a human body. Each finger moves, thumbs can grip, they can do back bends and other physical tricks. That is the way of the man's world-  superior toys for boys and lame toys for girls- Barbie can sometimes stand up by herself  if her top heavy front does not topple her forward,  her moves  are like  goosestepping for the SS. Barbie limits a child to boobs,weird looking feet molded for spike heels, tons of make-up and a forever glaring white toothy smile - an amazing wardrobe.  No news there,  glad I found Erik's \"action\" guys, they are a good time!  Orphans  inspiring them to be more creative, pride forth of July tomorrow. Celebration of flowers. Sweet peas . highly toxic but smell like what heaven surely  must smell- and my carnations , second year triumph! Edible as you may remember from corsage years , dancing with your best beau, each nibbling on the corsage worn on your color bone area so that it did not get mashed when Moon River began to play. Oh those lovely racing hormone years of close, slow dancing.  -0-Fabric I found online but one must buy at least fifteen yards to make the sale valid. That is a bit much! I only need enough for a flag- a better option than  red white and blue ,I reckon. I will think of something else- I have seen loads of rainbow flags waving instead of the usual stars and stripes. A very GOOD thing. This was another option, same company:and this?I just got a message from the doctor's office , to return their call on Wednesday when they are open for business, I delivered Poop on a stick to make sure that all is well  and that I will never need a colonoscopy again. Usually if all is well they do not bother calling me- so...they better not disappoint. I have had a couple of bacon sandwiches so ...most likely - cancer and am going to depart in a most terrible way, wasted the hair balancing! Dang."},

I lifted it to the middle of the floor, sprayed it with NEEM water, washed every leaf with Dawn water, sprayed it again and will wash the leaves again. It must be left in the center of attention until the mites have all gone to mite heaven and every little green face  and bottom has been washed again and again. Attachment to house plants is a thing is it not?  Trying our best to keep them thriving in an unnatural environment like any pet.The wild ones on the deck  and the borrowed dog from the neighbor are the BEST!

Dusty Miller shot right out of the pot and into the plum tree- so enthusiastic!Lazy morning after yesterday when I bloody well cleaned my bloody fright of a car! Washed everything inside with  Windex, Fabulouso , and not so toxic , white vinegar. Every surface  scrubbed and vacuumed, the mats, rugs , the back end. Dennis then took it to the big  car wash for the outside swoosh and polish.  Tell you what, I am so compromised from lack of exercise that cleaning my car nearly put me in the hospital. This must be remedied. Walk to the mail box is a start...Received a thank you from  Opal, in the post. The girl who lives on the mountain side where the party was had for her graduation. I gave her the little guy that I had felted and the white dog to accompany her to university. She drew their picture so well! Looks exactly how they look. Best thank you card ever.Stella said that she would be picking me up in the afternoon , and she did. We lunched , but not until we played bumper cars in the underground parking garage...Stella kept her cool although she did moan about  it being the dumbest parking garage on the face of the earth and should not exist.  We did agree.She ordered a spritz, her all time summer fave, but it was  not even mediocre, I ordered a margarita , it ,too, was sub par. When I first moved to this state I was shocked at the bar drinks and their lack of integrity!   And so became the habit of BYO bottle and spruce up the watered down so called cocktails at the bar. Rarely do I have a cocktail but when I do and for the horrific price - I expect to taste more than  watered down pop.Forget about the buzz.We sat outside in the breeze and  shot the breeze, as you do- Stella on her way to Finland next week- packed and  loaded-ready. She brought gifts for the orphans. little pink shoes and a camera.The twins had an idea - and that idea was to take photos ! So they did. Nothing was off limits, photos of the toilet floor, photos of spider mites on the ficus, photos of the place on your neck where perfume might be worn.They took photos of all of the animals that live on the bookcase. Some were agreeable. Another photo of Ernie, which she did not like- no biscuits involved.\"What's the point?\" Wanting more of a challenge they went to a board room full of old dentists and snapped a shot of them looking like a line up of Q-tips. Pretty much their favorite. Then it was time for desert and a raspberry. Lemon Lavender cake.And that was the day. Time for a cup of tea and more muscle wasting, in front of the screen watching \"Slow Horses\" , a British series about spies and crime - liking it mostly for the street scenes.  It is a series that makes one feel they might need a shower. Gary Oldman is lead and about as grotty as one could ever be.  (the middle front row Q-tip is Dennis in a T shirt, the only thing he wears since ever I have known him. Keepin' it simple)"},

The first year I did not expect her to make it in this competitive gull world, one leg mangled, but there she is! She has crow friends that follow her around knowing that folks give her the best tidbits due to her leg. This little finch sat on the feeder for over thirty minutes, I am thinking that she might have bonked into a window or something and is collecting her wits. This is what was happening with the baby-this video sounds like this baby's distress. HERE. New mother woes. One baby clinging to the the post squealing, the other dancing around the mother on the deck squealing,crying. Loud! Disconcerting- and our impulse is to interfere and tell the mother to drop her attitude and give those babies some milk. Maybe it is weaning time, who knows. Anyway, hearing babies cry does me in.  I went to the mall, horror of all horrors! The mall here has become a ridiculous mass of closed shops, third rate shops and empty space. No one wanted the mall in the first place! It took up all of a huge  well established nursery/orchard-  also took away a thriving downtown of sweet shops. The mall has never been cool...now even less so- on my mission to find shoes, I reluctantly went. A big NOPE. The mall even smells toxic. I then  went to REI- always a great look around there, tried some shoes that got great online reviews. Saved me from ordering them only to send them back.The shoes were disappointing at best. I did not come away empty handed though ,because REI! 40% off ribbed cotton leggings- bought a pair-  bought two pair of merino blend socks. Saving postage -  about to order some online. Best for wicking and temperature control, can't beat wool products. Sheep are gods.Baby , confused by Mother's behavior -  please explain?Notice the tuft on top of her head and her dazed expression?

Some say yes, I say , oh hell no.  We had a picnic in the backyard of middle son's garden, A going away party for youngest grandson who will be leaving in a few days for DC and a new job, It is exciting but we can not talk about it.

We will go to the Hunterian museum for sure- drawn to that sort of thing, we are. her shelves and closet are full of bones, skulls, desiccated bugs, stones, the cool stuff!

They are now trying to recruit volunteers to try it out in the deep end of the tub.  None are interested at this point but the orphans never give up. The bouquet on the work table today was collected this morning from what the deck pots have to offer. Sweet peas and second year carnations being the most fragrant. I ordered some eco friendly hair conditioner just to try, it came package in what looks like earth with a little tin of cornflower seeds as a bonus.Late to start from seed but they will be good for next summer.Anyway,  feels good doing business with conscientious industry. Too little, too late, you say? I agree, it just makes ME feel better and that is what ME is all about. Right?

It is a perfect illustration of \"The Salt Path\". Maggie Rudy, Portland Oregon, whose work is utterly charming. thank you Boud, I adore her work!  Still on the look out for shoes that are not clown shoes. I have two more places to go in town and so many more online...hassle,my feet have become unpredictable along with everything else in the world. Sizes are inconsistent, material used to make shoes sometime feels like recycled hammers. The orphans think that is a brilliant idea but , they are probably made of the same stuff and they do not walk far.

It is stamped on the bottom and signed by the weaver- The company branched out in to  all sorts of household decorations but their baskets remain the best.  They were a direct sales business- like Avon, Amway, Mary Kay, Tupperware- So that rather puts the price of a basket above what most are willing to pay. Plus they are not common, especially up here so far from Ohio.  There is nothing special about the basket that I bought- it is sturdy, well made a good size with leather handles - big deal, but I could resell it if I wanted to because of its stamp .  Longaburger Building in Newark Ohio. Click HERE. I have read that the Texas company now owning the building turned it into luxury hotel. Rather like  the cool old buildings in London - abandoned, have become Luxury flats for the rich. At least they are still standing- protected for another while by big money.I bought another basket, plus a little carved wooden man signed on the underside and stamped \"NORGE\"- Norwegian day at the thrift store-The little girls ding donged my doorbell this morning- little smiling, adorable  faces - a fist full of flowers that they picked from the back of their yard.  The cuteness factor is off the charts.

Pretty sure I have mentioned that before...In the parking lot at the thrift store I met an old friend- we gabbed about all sorts. She recommended a book to read \" The Salt Path\", by Raynor Winn.  I ordered it when I got home and here it is- that quick! I will be the first to complain about the injustices and cruel treatment of workers by Amazon- I will also bemoan the carbon footprint left by the company- I am all talk.  It is like complaining about the sugar content of the very large soft serve being devoured , dripping on my frock- eating the whole damn thing, I am ridiculous.  Most humans are.-0- I cooked all of the chard and it is delish! I love my old cast iron wok- brought to me about 40 years ago or more by a friend (boyfriend) who searched all over Hong Kong to find it and to bring it to me. Heavy awkward thing to be hauling all over the world- best gift ever and some of the best adventures were experienced  with that lad!  Still use the wok, don't know where he got off to, though- some say he is in the  south west desert somewhere, or in Australia.  We found poppy goo together- became fans immediately. Poppy goo from Nepal, so, you know, it had to have been a spiritual gift...Felt spiritual to us, anyway.  Glad it is illegal, I guess...the real deal, not the crap on the street that kills everyone- Poppies never meant to kill and I swear to you, there is nothing in this world as amazing and blissful and life affirming as a wad of organic poppy goo from the Nepali mountains. I have been so lucky in this life. Quality! Off to read the new book, which I am sure all of you have read already!

This is as light as the day will get.So much cold rain, the flowers are loving it.Chard grew about three inches in a day! The squash is also growing quickly, exuberantly! Oh, and here comes another baby , but I am talking to you so I can not take its photo right now. It was quick- now gone. A blink.I love how the Moms gather on the deck ,  snooze, air their nips.  The Society of Mother Raccoons , occasionally waddling over to the excess water in the base of the flower pots for a sip of rain water flower tea, admiring the plump nips of the others. Well done, little mothers.   -0-On Friday I got a haircut, hair is somewhat better, not in my face all of the time but , really, no one has cut my hair like my old hair cutter/friend- who understood my weird cotton candy hair. It is like trying to fashion spiderwebs into some sort of reasonable do.My Hair cutter/friend and neighbor who lived just around the corner from me, has moved permanently to Italy. After the surprising, shocking and tragic death of her young son she could not stay- only way to somewhat cope was to leave- learn Italian - buy a place there. Forever  heart broken...I can not even imagine -I do not want to, ever. As long as my hair is out of my face and not in my mouth and not flying in every direction, I'm good. The rain helps also. I looked online at old lady haircuts for maybe a reference of some sort- they all look the same. Bubble in back, long on the sides, organized into a helmet shape, they all look like complaining to the manger is their favorite hobby.  Anyway at this point , 76 , still breathing - lips that are nothing more than a thin  smirking line- appearance does not matter in the least. We are invisible at this age. One of the perks.On to better things- I ordered a pair of shoes that will come tomorrow. Hemmed and hawed over them, bought some that were cheaper, sent those back, bought some that were cheaper still and just shoved them in my closet. Trying to avoid the pricey ones that I really fancy...So, I will  try them on, and decide that the purchase is a dumb  and over the top- send them back and just stick with my old Hoka-One -One, hoping that they do not fall apart having worn them for six years-  OLD for a shoe. Shoes and hair. Nothing is perfect.In for the day- cold , raining and dark. So much house work to be done it is daunting- where to start, I wonder all of the time- so I  just don't.  New Rolling Stone came-  a few interesting articles, one stands out that rather pisses me off-  since  Maga (Nazis) are so well armed and not shy about shooting everyone that gets in their way, the left has now also armed themselves to the teeth- gays /antifa/ liberals/ students/librarians- adding gas to the fire.  Wild west shoot 'em up. Have the United States ever been rational?"},

Just saying...Oh, I take that back- it was invented by Miss Sonora Smart Dodd in Spokane Washington in 1910 - as she sat in church on Mother's day and thought to herself \"why is there not a father's day\" (every damned day is a father's day if you want to know....) anyway, that is how that came to be- took off like wildfire, of course it did. My Dad could not  have cared less about father's day, he knew he was a dad he didn't need a card to tell him. he was a pretty great Dad, irascible and sometimes ridiculous but never abusive or mean. He worked bloody hard for the dollar and bought us stuff - we were spoiled, I reckon. Lucky and spoiled. He had a \"temper\", they used to call it.  Anger Management was not a thing back then. Cold- cocked his boss one time with a baking tray- industrial sized.  That nearly landed him in the slammer but the boss man did not press charges, just gave Dad the boot. Mom could not trust his anger after that so the threat was real- if he ever lost it with us kids - she was done...He loved her more than anything so it stuck. Great that they figured that one out. Mom did the Momming and Dad did the Dadding, that is how it was until we kids were old enough for him to relate to and  to teach us stuff- like how to find rocks of value and fossils and play gin rummy and write a check and keep our powder dry.  Folks get all gooshy on Dad's day with tributes and praise- but you know what- it is just life, kudos for sticking around. Big deal I think. Now....Mother's day that is different!! Mother's are Godesses of life- holy cow, do you know how hard it is to make a whole human being with your own body and then keep it alive until it is old enough to do it on their own? Of course you do, bloody heroic I think!-0-Town from the top of the street today.  Nice zoom better than phone that is for sure- Thinking I may take my camera with me in the end. I do want a good zoom. It is clunky and the charger is clunky but zoom is so seductive....Hope you had a FATHER'S day. and this-Is what it is. Power."},

I won't , but I could.   The traffic is getting crazy, driving out and back was crowded and wild. It is like folks forgot how to drive in the sunlight, or something. Also Canadians are back, notoriously poor drivers, rather aggressive but I think they have to be to drive in Vancouver.There were traffic jams coming back into town, just too many people.The lake is crowded also, with lily pads, a solid surface, NOT good for lake health or for property owners but it is pretty.There is a forest of weeds growing in the lake that chokes off swimmers and sometimes boats. Unhealthy, there are people who  can come up from Seattle to do underwater weeding, professionals and are probably expensive but the weed problem and the lily pads compromise use of the lake as well as lowering property value, so there is that. Still it is lovely out there in Stella's little gem of a garden. Her flowers are at their peak at the moment and everything is perfectly lovely. We sorted out most of the ills of the world and tried to decide on what sort of hair cuts we will be getting for ease of travel. She is leaving soon for Finland for a rather quick trip- has to get back to Lucy , the pup.Today I will be getting a hair cut- always iffy - my hair is a problem and kudos to any one who can cut in nicely!Best hair cut I have had was in Palm Springs but that is kind of a distance to go just to get a hair cut- I actually gave that a thought but the lad who did the wonderful job is no longer there. My other hair cutter has gone to live in Italy- so ....my hair is getting weirder by the day- fine , thin, old, challenging.When I came home I bought more strawberries , local farm, delicious with so much flavor one might swear that they had never eaten a strawberry before- not a REAL one! Dennis can eat strawberries with heavy cream , these will not last long-making the most of the season right now.He has gone to Seattle and won't be back until late Saturday , blessed time alone in the house, keeping the doors open and the air breezing through.Last evening as I was watching something on computer, out of the corner of my eye-in the doorway- Oh, Hello.Ernie! Sweet neighbor's dog watching me,  when I looked up her tail banged the - happy  wag wiggle \"thank you for noticing me, got treats?\"  As it happened I did have  hamburger for her- I hope her family does not mind...She stayed for a long time. I tried to walk her home but she would have none of that, thank you, and just followed me back into the house, plopped down and closed her eyes. When I went out to water the deck garden  plump mother raccoon was waiting for me. I filled her water pan and tossed out kibble , closed the door so Ernie would not try to make \"friends\". When I returned after plant's long drink, Ernie had gone home. For a while there I thought I had a dog of my own... Good thing I do not-  would be tethered to its upkeep and well being, they are such emotional creatures. leaving them is like the end of the world to them- I understand Stella's quick trip and not leaving her pooch for a very long time. Dogs will gitcha!  Stella's bachelor buttons in a barrel by the road.  The road is like a speedway, her mail box is right there as cars lightening fast zip by, That is probably the only downfall of living by the lake.

Anyway, as is, it is  such a wonderful thing to have. Olivia will be their one and only.I spent a couple of days with Flora Jane, genius child. She is talking clearly and a lot, like a two foot tall adult. She can count to fifteen and say all of the alphabet- she is decisive and loves a good book- she loves life entirely. This is her BIG baby dressed up for what? I don't know...Emily is trying to interest Flora in \"dressing up\" but wise child is not having it.I agree wholeheartedly with Flora- dressing up is \"uncomfortable\". Fashion is for the others who dig that sort of thing. Flora is intellectual, curious about how things work and there is nothing quite like a hammer and and a knife (wooden) to get things done. When I was a child The story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf scared me so much. I pleaded with my parents to move into a brick house. Of course they laughed that off , especially since our house of hefty wood and concrete ,was anchored so well into  the hard earth that an 80 mile an hour incessant wind only rattled the windows. Also, in the story,  wolves get such a bad rap. When I told the 3 pig story to Flora she just looked at me like \"that's a silly story\"...still, I noticed a bit of \"hmmm\" so we will not retell that story to her ever again. She is right- it's a silly story with no merit.  In light of  brick houses , the orphans finished their pebble house for their dragon, feeling secure in the fact that  pebbles are stronger than straw.They added tiny straw flowers on  the edge of the roof after they had already taken it outside for this photo. It is now  complete.  One large bottle of tacky glue was used in the building of dragon house. The orphans owe me their allowance. ha-ha....lavender is coming on wonderfully probably due to all of the rain last week. The air smells like your Grannie's toilet water or Grampa's shaving soap. -0-Yesterday I went to a doctor's appointment , the fifth doctor I have been through - they all seem to retire early or i have outlived them all.  This new  one is a winner- she minds her own business but has  delightful curiosity and time to chat. I just wanted to check under the hood to see if travel was going to offer any health surprises, the answer is \"no surprises at all\" , I am shorter and more broad, comes with the effects of gravity and eating loaves of bread but I am just fine. All systems GO. Blood pressure great, no prescribed meds of any kind, heart good, blood good, just at the breaking off age for getting Mams so no more squish - terror of waiting for results. Same with colonoscopy, I guess it is reckoned that the treatment for cancer at some point in one's life is just too brutal for the payoff of a few more years to struggle through feeling like death would be a welcomed guest.  So, fine, knock knock knockin' on heaven's door, intact, well traveled, tread hitting the 2/32\" threshold, carrying on in my short tank body. It is good.Flora likes to take my picture....she took several but this one is my fave. Beautiful sunny day today, I am going out to Stella's for a nosh and a natter. Be well, y'all.  So much love!"},

She is wee- 4 LBS 10 OZ but is quite tall @19\". she will be a dancer probably , like her Mom. And her fingers are long so she can play the piano to accompany herself - Possibly  a performance artist! Speaking of performance-I watched TAR last night and am still wondering WTF? Clearly the acting was superb , Cate never disappoints. Mood  throughout was - um- kind of insane- Musicians take their world so very seriously. The ending sent me to \"google- explains- all\". TAR could have been better- a bit less cryptic, more in depth character study to give  viewer more of a \"feel\". As it turns out I did not give a damn about anyone in the film.Mysterious gnome appeared on Dennis's dirt hill yesterday.Not so mysterious really. Neighborhood gnomes and garden things appear in other's yards every now and then. Steve is the neighbor who started this giving spree.

Humans are so egocentric they do not believe  anything exists that they can not see or hear themselves . The orphans know that  is absurd but , having observed humans for a while now, not much surprises them. Still amused by the fact that humans think that mirrors are real and the reflection is them...hahaha !   Below is art by Flora Jane- I am gobsmacked by this! The flow and energy of it is what artists try to achieve  but rarely can because most artists are too self conscious or too ARTED out . Chinese calligraphy has this sort of energy& Sumi art brush strokes. The part of this Flora art that astonishes the most  is the orange rhythm section,    and the blue dry brush effect as well as the grey shadow under the black line.THIS- do you see its genius?  A week of  making new stuff.Olivia taking the prize  for getting born after such a nail biting journey! Flora also wins a prize for her incredible art and the faun for being born  bold and giving his mother fits. We all can relate to that I am sure! Olivia sure to do the same...She looks like she may be thinking about it.Sunday, all is well, relaxing,  new rule- always check the water in your water bottle before gulping- Employ orphans  in the  building  of a pebble house for  beings who move quickly.

Looks like Christmas in so called summer.The one amazing squash blossom from yesterday - curled tightly, soaked and shivering.There may be news of a baby getting born today- labor began last night so one would hope that things go more hare paced than turtle.I am feeling the urge to unplug due to political BS heating up and the folly of indictments, justice all that.  Emails begging for handouts$$$ and me feeling less inclined to donate as the days go by - emails piling up - I donated a one time generous donation to Bob Ferguson  yet I still get emails begging every damn day.

I took my bag of toys over which she was glad to see but added a new book in the bottom of the bag- she went for it straight away. \"BOOK!!!!\" scooted right over to my ample lap to  read .  Speaking of ample- I just read an article by Virginia Sole-Smith who wrote \"FAT\". I love her! Finally with her out in everyone's face and with TikTok  and this younger generation dancing and singing and celebrating their ample bodies with glee!  Fat shaming is such an evil- and I love how Virginia puts it all into the frame of human existence. Diet culture is as lethal as gun culture in this land, but more damning and less acceptable ( to be fat, I mean). That is when my expletives go to work- I drag out every single one I have heard since second grade and put some oomph behind them. I am old ( another bias in this youth culture) and fat ( shamed by friend i have known since we were teens, and  the husband) . It is all I can do to not murder them in their sleep.  I pretty much have ghosted my friend - murder is still a possibility for the other.... \"why don't you lose weight?\" ----\"Well, um, why don't you grow taller and get some  hair?\" That is how ridiculous it gets. So, I am ordering Virginia's book to put on the table by the eating place where Mr.Man will read anything that is set there. Education is everything.  Just a few feet from me- through the torn screen door, pleased with herself for helping with the \"art installation\" and proud of  not giving a shit.

{"title": "A great book, a party and Mars", "date": "Monday, June 5, 2023", "text": "Tau-tausI walked to the book store where our neighbors presented a reading, a slide show and a lecture re: the book finally in publication. Marjolein and Peter have been researching for well over seven years the life and times of this incredible man, Peter. Marjo, his daughter,  now lives in The Hague and travels back and forth every year to work on this book, and to take care of her parents and the garden. Traveling to Indonesia, as well , to gather information of the times of Peter growing up there. His family  left Holland in 1916 as \"missionaries\", his father,  a doctor of linguistics and  his mother, a well educated nurse, loved the people and the area- ideal- came to know and respect their culture more than their mission- then the war happened . Held in  six different Japanese internment  prison camps as a young lad, four of his family were lost at that time, Peter, inventive, clever and strong- learned six languages, German, dutch, English, French, Japanese and Indonesian, which helped him to understand what was happening around him as well as being able to communicate in a world war where languages varied. Marjo's time was limited for the reading - she started out with a bang! Toraja funerals! It was customary to keep the body of a loved one in the house for weeks, sometimes years. Tau-taus were carved resembling the deceased, a cave carved out of the mountain side for it to \"live\" with the others , up high, looking out over the villages. Funerals could last for years before the tau-tau and the body were placed in the chiseled rock grave. Excellent book, excellent life, stellar family. Peter just had another birthday, 91, a lifetime of  advocating for peace, a lifetime of incredible adventure, love for humanity and optimism. On the way to the bookstore I shot several experimental photos with four different cameras to see if I could narrow camera carry down for travel.There is no perfect camera. I want small with zoom ability- as you know Iphone and Ipad are too pixelated when zoomed their best zoom, and my canon is too cumbersome, great for zoom but fuzzy for normal shots. Dennis had a tiny canon about four inches by 2.5 - digital, but the delay is terrible ,  stabilizing, non existent,  if one holds perfectly still for about four minutes or so, the shots are clear.This is one-through the glass door about fourteen feet away, me not breathing for four minutes, trying not to tremble.This is another about the same distance, in low light, holding still for about one minute. So, you can see that it would not be the one for travel though its size is pocket friendly. (Marjo and Peter) Oh the struggle...plus finding the perfect pair of shoes is another. I have sandals sorted, German made Finn comfort- highly recommend for the most comfortable sandal ever! I can walk for hours in them. For winter- I guess back to  my very old worn Hoka and hope that they hold up. On Sunday our little Opal had her graduation party, her shoes are the best! I checked them out online- $399.00 , so I will just stick with what I have. Or will I?Time whizzes by!  She is off to Lewis and Clark college in the fall-  if you look it up it is dubbed a liberal rich white kids college a bit south of central  Portland- a relatively good adjusting college for youngin'. She can decide what she wants to do after at least one year there. She is a skilled artist and designer so I am reckoning that she will move on  after  equilibrium is established being away from home. setting the table...Amy and Opal went to a friend's peony  garden and collected about 150 blooms. the garden is closing down so blooms are up for grabs!Remarkably Amy found vases for all!Their house in on the side of the mountain above the sound. I knew i would get lost as I nearly always do, so I went early. Of course I got lost, went all the way up the mountain until my ears popped and the road became very narrow and scary, the drop off is significant!Finally found the correct road down the mountain farther and had read the invitation wrong- i was an hour and a half early. I am old enough now that I can blame age and i am blond enough that that excuse has always come in handy. Both are used frequently.Vinny on the patio looking regal. Best little pup - when he first came to the family , he was about three inches long- I thought he would get sat on or slammed into a cupboard- so tiny! He is now eleven and somewhat larger! The sofa on which he sits was carried down the mountain side by the wind and ended up on the main road below,  quite an impressive drop! Amy thought that some one must have stolen it but who would do such a thing- they live so remotely and the sofa is large. Crazy wind and steep mountain thievery.   I think Vinny has taken it upon his wee self to anchor the sofa , protecting it from another flight.Frightening drop off  and the swing chair over the  steep abyss, where Opal did her homework.  I.Can't.Even.That was the week end plus NPR live- watching in real time MARS!"},

A walk around the neighborhood , checking on people's gardens and flowers. There are many but it seems there are mostly wild flowers growing as though we are still in lock down covid days. Curious how those years changed everything for us- some for the better- like- staying home more, letting nature be natural.  Lupines and buttercups, foxglove and poppies taking over  where  there once were mowed lawns. Maybe people have decided that \"the look\" is not all that - given up control- it is easier than trying to tame the land . That can only be a good thing , especially for spring bugs!Walking in the  brand new sunshine is amazing, blinding- sunglasses are essential! A hat is too . When I got home I ordered one that actually fit my  micro head. That is another result of the covid years- too bad for brick and mortar but, tell you what- ordering from where I am sitting right now and getting the thing in two days is quite remarkable. So, now I have a hat that I would never have been able to find in this town.It is a good one and can crumple up to fit into a carry on or a pocket while walking. Springs right back into shape! Unlike the person wearing it. There comes a point when \"springing into shape \" is no longer likely. Walking in the sunshine , seeing in 3D like I just got eyes and am trying them out.For the longest time I thought my glasses were at fault but , no, it is just the light of day , rather lack of, that made me think that vision might be a thing of the past- like \"springing\". My glasses are just fine.Big cottage/little cottage...neighborhood hasn't changed much  although there was a large chunk of ground that has been made bare where the cutest little cottage and garden was. Right on the corner- blackberries all around it protecting it from intruders. GONE! just like that! Dimes to doughnuts there will be a condo built...Building in this town has suddenly  gone nuts- slapped together with no thought of esthetics , quality or environment. I would say \"butt ugly\" but I don't know about that expression...I think butts are cute and they are really great cushions. Without them sitting would be impossible - and then what would I do with my time???Sitting now , reading the book that I ordered from , yes, EvilAmazon...One would have to sit  to read this exceptional horror story written by  Daniella Mestyanek Young  about being raised in the worst sex cult imaginable , not as suicidal  as Jonestown and maybe not as widely spread as Mormonism , a cult is a cult- but \"The Family\" or \"Children Of God\" as it was known in the beginning really takes the cake for patriarchal insanity and sexploitation.  -God is love and love is sex and your body is god's and children as young as 6 months old can be married off to the old toot that invented this horror show- according to the \"family\".  So, yeah, disturbing as hell , this life of a young girl in this prison of depravity where beatings were daily , starvation and isolation , thought control , no reading, lack of education , rape  and orgies with children - WOW, unfathomable but there you have it. Reasons to read this ?  Question nature or nurture- that old argument and to question everything everyone who, affecting conviction or authority, says, especially if they are male. Though Daniella was born into this situation she managed to get out eventually , educate herself, enroll in school- she has  just graduated - a masters from Harvard and has a  family of her own.  Who knows how wonky her psyche might be- I have not yet read that far. I found her on a podcast being interviewed by an ex-Mormon woman- the opposite of the Children of God's philosophy-but  Mormon \"purity\" code has much in common- just opposite end of the spectrum - both are extreme. \"Uncultured\" is a gripper, very well written and flows right along, however ,  it should come with a warning to many of us who were  little girls caught in a powerless situation, confused, exploited,  called \"love\" and  OH the shame of it all. Patriarchal bullshit is the downfall of humankind. Perhaps it is more than that- why do we buy in? Fear? Most likely. It is complex, this being human on this planet event.  We are finally (maybe) coming to terms with the fact that there are more than two genders in our species ( except in Florida...)  That there are all of the in betweens - still dominant are the CISgender males - they do like control, they are used to it, it is their \"birthright\" , anything else is a threat to that, I suppose. Ok, enough of that heavy heaviness.  On to - STUFF.These are the things I found for a dollar in the charity shop-  and three little pigs- I had some that I got from ETSY along with the wolf but I gave them  to Flora - I was lucky to find these three for a dollar in the charity shop, the orphans love them.

Time waits for no old lady!  Last night I experienced another episode of sleep paralysis. That has not happened for a while . Terrifying!  Something leapt onto the bed at the foot , where the dogs used to sleep, so that was not alarming. But then a dark heavy body crept up behind me as I slept on my side, wrapped itself around me will ill intent, I can not holler, I can not move, It's big arm crossed over me and pulled me tightly to it (him) . He laughs /growls- like Roy of Ted Lasso, that sort of deep guttural growl. Small and paralyzed, enveloped into his heavy dark horror...my heart pounded so hard it jerked me  semi awake into that in-between space for a minute then, Fully awake after a few minutes, I jumped  out of bed, checked the corners of the room, and  walk through the house to shake it off , crying, heart still pounding. No one knows what causes sleep paralysis,   maybe anxiety or some other mental illness. During the day I am not aware of any wonky-ness but when I sleep I guess my brain  goes to work  trying to sort something out .  Unpleasant and frightening and no thank you!

Perhaps I am anxious about her future, who knows.  20 months old and she is way smarter than Kim and I put together, That child!  She sees all and misses nothing!  I did watch the PBS program  before bed,\" The United States and the Holocaust\" , which sent me into a tail spin.  That could have stayed with me in my sleep . I thought it important to realize some things about this land where we live- but tell you what...it is worse than we ever thought - were brain washed to think. Is it better to remain ignorant? It might be, for one's own mental health , but, for  big picture and forewarning of what is certainly to come, could be good to have a head's up....know what we might be dealing with- take note of the warning signs and red flags. ( run away! Catch the trade winds in your sails.)Anyway, if you want some  educating do watch that program , Peter Coyote's voice , as usual, comfortably familiar... I have not finished with it yet, Taking a breather and hoping that the big dark entity does not come into my bed tonight.More flowers in the brain!And Flora, the OMG genius child! Bound to contribute to  good dreams and restful slumber. I will listen to some good music as well. Chase the bugaboos away for fucking ever!Yes, Please.It has been raining quite alot for the past two days. Flowers getting soaked, sun comes out for one minute and everything shoots up and out and gets all fluffy with new buds. BEAUTY! Temperature in the house @62 degrees!"},

They came to the baby shower, as he is the Grand dad of baby still taking her time on the inside.  Her name might be Margo Olivia- not sure yet. When Brian got home and was unpacking his truck, Sadie was laying on her cushion minding her own little business, as usual. Out of nowhere, and very quickly ,a dog came upon her and shook the life out of her. No reason.I know that pit bulls get a bad rap, that their breeders have to be mindful, that their owners have to be super trainers, consistent and true. Actually one of my favorite breeds but they can be Jeckyll -Hydish -like a wild animal made domestic- never know when the switch will flip and their wild nature will surprise you. The pit bull was killed as this was not the first time he had gone into fighting killing mode. -0- On a better note- the Orphans elected a Mayor. He is from the bin at the Co-Op , at first reckoned to be a gopher but indeed he is a Prairie dog from Wyoming.  I looked him up.  A  capable Mayor he will be!The orphans had a casual ceremony - crowning him with a garden basket, giving him their only hoe, they had heard that he liked to dig (and also that the Mayor of this larger people town liked hoes...not even kidding.), and challenging him to make a good enough  speech, worthy of this honor.  He was spectacular, Especially the speech  in elegant Prairie dog  squeals. \"That will do\", they agreed and went about getting him ready for the formal evening event.There was a parade of marching petals and ants, music from the \"damned starlings\" in the roof. There was a proper speech of movingly expressive  squealing - there was a brioche bun from the bakery, large enough for the entire crowd. Orphan town in good hands. Welcome Mr. Mayor. Adults adulting may think that this Prairie dog  came to us for the sake of Flora...Those adults would be wrong.Mr. Mayor will be traveling with me when I depart for the shore of the Thames. I can not wait! Getting out of this god forsaken land will be just in time before I lose all of my bearings! All week I have been on my own, in my own little world- Dennis gone. Binge watching all 30 hours of Ted Lasso and some other things on Apple TV. Superb! Today, however, Kim called and filled me in on what has happened during this past week- none of it good- murders - gunfire in park and lake- Kim walking her dog on a beach minding her own damned business thank you, some old toot went up to her called her a name that we were unsure of while telling her to get off of the beach because her dog was not allowed. (?) Anyway , the name was \" Potlicker\" - never heard that one before, had to look it up. There was more news of the week but those two things are  stand outs.Staying at home seems like a no brainer these days- guns, shooting , killing willy nilly is such  a fad....  Getting out of this insane country is the best idea ever! September will come soon enough, I know it will- time seems like a meth addicted freak- a thousand miles a minute in all directions. Still , I would like to leave within the next twenty minutes.I have my Australian Student card!  Think I can use it? When we lived in  Thorne Road squats in  south London it seemed everyone  had a special talent for something extraordinary. There were plumbers, electricians , carpenters, teachers, a lawyer,  a couple of med students, and one guy who could make convincing Cards of all sorts! This card was good for student discounts, flights, museums and galleries, Plays and concerts, the cinema- student advantages for NHS,  it was GOLD!So, yeah, we stuck it to the man...I was 26.  Back home Nixon was hanging by his fingernails, VietNam  raging, kids / friends blown up for no reason or at the very least fucked up for the rest of their lives- all of our marching and protesting ending in bashed heads and jail time, sometimes death, \"four dead in Oh- Hi -Oh\"- Government  terror - which it has become again.  Time to bail! The future was yesterday...especially at my age.So , bah blah blah, no news there. I am sitting here now with the doors wide open, a Squirrel by my feet interested in my toes, a raccoon halfway on the inside rug by the door helping herself to  peanuts.  Happy. In this moment life could not be better.Feeling secure, in good  Prairie dog paws...."},

She made lunch of her choice, what she really wanted. it was a perfect day on the lake, in the sun. We had spritz! our favorite drink, in rainbow glasses.The flamingos have a new home with Stella. When I came back home I put more eighties bell charms on the necklace that was Erik's when he was three. These were a fad as big and short term as beanie babies but way less trouble. Taking up little space, more interesting, and fun to wear. Erik never wore it (I did)  but was thrilled every time we got a new charm from the bookstore down the street.He had just had his forth birthday when Dennis decided that his new obsession - \"Pursuit Of Excellence\", now called \"context\", was a good idea for himself, his staff and me.  We all drove south to Seattle for the long, weirdo workshops, ending late at night, driving two hours away from the city in  the darkness and sleepiness, only to do it again the next day, for a week. The only memorable thing about it , other than cult bullshit, was that out of 320 people in the group I was the very last one chosen for  teams of \"cunning\". A contest of competition and sly wiliness, \"intelligence\" they called it. Two teams of 110 people each and I was the very last one , reluctantly , chosen.After the intense workshops of \"Excellence\", sleep deprivation and hunger...Another workshop in the series was offered. The series was very expensive, Dennis picked up the tab - he \"believed\". So off I went to what was called \"The Wall\". A camp on an island where rules and workshops , cultish manipulations, and exercise determined our stay., you know , fighting your demons, understanding & taming them , pointing the finger at yourself....To  bring food issues to the fore, or whatever- really  cheap  minimal meals were offered,  water and oats for breakfast, an apple , string cheese and two soda crackers for lunch, fried rice mush  and veg for dinner. Not allowed to speak to anyone, we ate family style , not allowed to talk or offer the communal spoon to another.... the only time we could speak was when we were all in the lodge for \"work\" and could speak to the group when it was our turn. There was one hour of \"free\" time during the long day, where we were encouraged to sit in nature and contemplate what we had learned. Sometimes during that hour we were given an assignment-  write a poem about something in nature that reflects who you are- that sort of thing., or make a list of your shortcomings to be addressed...Anyway, I had never been away from Erik  for longer than twenty minutes. I left charms on his necklace on his pillow. He still remembers that time.Mother's day bouquet fading quickly. Some flowers bending right out of the vase, seeking their own. Dying tulips are so cool.I have a week to myself! I get so much done here when I am just me. Mr. Man has gone to Orlando for a hypnosis conference to take a \"Master\" class. Did he learn nothing from the \"excellence\" grift? Guess not.When he is gone I leave doors open and windows wide, air circulating through the house, feels lovely. Crank up the music, joyfully sweeping, polishing and cleaning. Squirrel destroyed the screen door. I thought it was just out of boredom, something to do, but , no, he had a plan... I don't mind him running around  my feet- I stay still and just watch as he curiously sniffs around.  Going to the dentist today, will miss Granny day with Kim and Flora. After my appointment I am free for an entire week- glorious alone time! Rare,  needed. Maybe art will happen?Cheers!"},

Our favorite Mother and sister mom to be soon enough- met Kim and I (grannies) at the restaurant above the pier for a Mother's day celebration- we are  amazing, if you are asking. Growing an entire human in our small frames- bones shifting, organs shifting, bodies changing utterly beyond recognition, to be  portals to usher beings into earth zone. Oh yeah!  To be a female on this planet gets all of the kudos. If no one is there to appreciate this amazing feat then we, mothers, will.  I am duly impressed with how our two girls are mothering, are  being, so present, wise and strong! The koi welcomed us , blew a few bubbles. they are so friendly, like little puppies wiggling curiously to see if maybe you might have something for them.After lunch/breakfast, which the girls bought !!! We exchanged flowers and went for a little walk down to Taylor's dock where sunshine life, with very little clothing, was happening as though people had never experienced sun before!  Kids on the outside of the  pier's barrier , jumping from a great height into the 50 degree freezing bay!  Swimming over to the floating dock, walking up the ramp and doing it all again. and again. Brains not yet fully developed, you understand. The young lad with his folks watching, jumped a couple of times - There he is - still alive, in the unfriendly water. Mother's wince- and then Emily tells us that, yes indeed, she had jumped from the pier into the freezing sound at three o'clock in the morning, darker and colder than anyone can imagine - probably fueled by some sort of \"beverage\".... Dear lord, I am glad I do not know all of the things...There goes another girl, SPLOOSH!These lads all jumped at once, a running leap.Once on the floating dock things sort of settle down.Some are sunbathing, catching their breath.And some insist that the water is inviting- in they go, bloody hell!So begins summer, I guess. And the days of crazy shenanigans for the young and insane. Mother's need not know everything....please.Mr. Man went south with his buddy today to a radio swap meet. He brought home an antenna , put it together so that he can finally call home? I dunno. Radio geekery.This little bouquet is from Kim's garden, smells divine! Allergies are kicking in. Eyes itchy and red, vertigo- so annoying. I took a benadryl because I bought the wrong antihistamine, Benadryl is crap, brain fog, snoozy, feels weird. Better than vertigo  any day- but not ideal. Bouquet from the girls,  the loveliest I have ever received, sorry that I could not do it justice with my phone camera. Sorry that I can not keep it forever. Such a wonderful day! If you are a Mom, congratulations for being so damned awesome!! I leave you with a handsome fish bubble in appreciation. Bloop!"},

The little rabbit in the front yard looked delicious to something, dog, coyote, hawk- something.  I counted seven flies dining, took a photo but am pretty sure you do not want to have that in your memory bank. So, instead, here are finches at the feeder. And a well contented raccoon drinking from my brownie pan in the glorious sunshine. Sunshine changes everything! The zucchini plants have grown 2 inches in two days. Zucchini and radishes, the most encouraging plants for  an impatient gardener...The basement looks mighty festive - Rhodies in bloom,  plump fern. I noticed this as I walked by the  downstairs window. An errant leaf stuck to the glass with a perfect little peep hole for zeroing in on the falling down fence. Someone ought to wash the basement windows. They are , as you can see, spotty and sticky enough to capture a leaf. I  have window washing equipment, washed windows for pin money, at one point, but of course all has been lost in the recesses of the mystery garage.  For years there has been the absolute worst stench coming from the garage, especially when the sun heats everything . Combination of something dead, petrol, poop , 4 day old diapers, sulfur,  rot, lethal  chemicals nauseating and eye watering. \"What the hell is that?\" I would ask every year. I would have searched but I have no idea what is in there and it is dangerous and if I start tossing stuff around  to find whatever, I am disrupting one egocentric's idea of order. Finally , his nose perked up and he went through the underbelly of hoarded shite- found  killer chemicals , bottle broken and spilled  and a gas can that had rusted through -the toxicity   of that combo was everywhere. Deadly, probably... there is still a lingering odor but do-able. Hoarders are  mildly irritating , dangerous probably, difficult always. The sun shining has caused shadows and interesting lights thrown around the wall. It is like a whole new world!Supposed to be a dry hot summer  so it is good that we have had  much rain and snow as a buffer. Forest fires becoming a yearly threat.Most people do not have air conditioning up here,  never been needed before, but now is essential. Another thing to acclimate to. On we go.  But for now, the sun is a wondrous thing. Vitamin D and warmth, through air void of  moist grey fog obscuring  edges and  vision, WOW.  Sun is miraculous!Spring is  Baby bear's porridge, just right.  Rhodies  blooming large. Every spring I say in astonishment, \"This is the best year ever for Rhodies!\" I would also say \"How lucky we are\", but y'all know how we pay for it in the long dark winter of our discontent...spring comes just in time- we snap out of it - become glad, less suicidal. Leaving you with some  measure of delight - Our most clever darling with  alpaca. Blossoming, Flora Jane full blown toddler, marvelous infant growing to be the most awesome little individual.  God, she is smart! We are in awe. Her parents are so damned cool. Skills!Flora at work...woof woof."},

Walking under them is dodgy but charming, cooing melodically to one another, catching up with the news I reckon.  Stella and i went to a plant sale down yonder. The sale was not a sale at all but rather a benefit for the school district, prices jacked up for the so called event. We only bought a few things, called them liars- and went to an antique shop on the way. tiny house with LOADS of dusty stuff, we were required to mask. Good thing as it was very dusty.This is the door to \"oh no, I have fallen and can not get up\". Stella going downstairs in the shop saying \"you better not be taking my picture!\" \"oh no, says I, I would never\". We went to Fred's to quell our now overly stimulated thirst for more plants and got lucky. The prices were excellent and the plants healthy! One can never have enough in the spring up here- growing from seed is iffy- a head start needed. Bubble machine on the deck for the party was quite a hit! The little neighbor girls brought their friends over offering picked flowers from the azalea bush in back of their house. They came in but only briefly, probably realizing that it was not necessarily a kid party- I gave them a hand full of Non Pariel  - and later the balloons to hang in their room. Steve thought that the flag that Dennis left in their yard by his golden flamingo was planted  by our other neighbor, so he left a garden gnome in their yard, leaving them confused and wondering. Steve also upgraded the \"fountain\" of run off from the hillside- the little plants in pots and butterflies are solar powered, the unicorn is real! The party for Cara and her baby was splendid- all of the food was perfectly delicious, none left over except for some of the fruit rainbow- SO much fruit! The girls tidied up after and left everything sparkling!Flora had a great time-  charmer of the day needless to say. She got a gift as well, a berry hat! She discovered that maybe the wish part of the dandelion is not the edible part. ( Photo sent from Em after she got home) All in all this has been a very fine week end, even though the weather was iffy and damp. All happy, in great spirits, fabulous people, delicious food and amazing cake. Who could go wrong?We took no notice of  Chuck's panto prance...that two and half million certainly could have done some good - but , no, must carry on with the charade. I would have been one of the protesters arrested if I lived there, pretty sure. Charles missed an opportunity to do something significant, to step out of the antiquated traditional BS that hinders progress and laughs in the face of England's povos. Disgusting and sorry, but \"Queen Camilla\" dear lord!  Get a real job! Working in a dairy perhaps...( shame on me, that was such a stab!) Here is a cake to send you off on in a better mood.... Long live those who eat this gluten free ricotta cake with mascarpone icing.

It is effectively hiding the terrible nest of wires in back of the see through table. It is one of the finest things I have ever owned. I thank my lucky stars for Mary ,  every day! there are not enough lifetimes for me to ever be able to produce that much hardanger.  Mary saved me from hours,days , years, of pricking my fingers and cursing at cloth.I did about two inches once. That's it.  HERE- you can see why...Dennis bought the flamingos to sneak over onto the neighbors lawn in the secret dark of night , a joke but I rather like them tacky as they are! So I will use them for the shower and then he can sneak them over to Steve's yard. I had to go to the dollar store to get a baby for the stork flamingo and I am not sure anyone will appreciate the decor as much as I... They are all tasteful and minimal...so I am pushing it a bit.  Wacky tacky old dollar store granny. (sorry, not sorry)I blew up so many balloons- seven popped loudly- I hit the deck! Five had holes in them from manufacturer defect, and three or four went scrotum. But all in all, I think there are enough. I can not do one more blow job, don't ask me to,I am done.I had purchased herb starts for one of the deck pots but will use those as well for the shower, they make a nice basket full of fresh smelling goodness. We are all about wholesome, don't you know...The girls will be here at 9:00 to finish doing their whatevers, icing a cake...cutting fruit and making salad- that sort of last minute thing. It is raining, of course, and tomorrow does not look much better from what the weather lord predicts.  The poppies have melted, petunias threatening to die...rain is good in pints not gallons. supposed to be a cursed hot dry summer - we will look back on these cool rainy days with yearnings.  Never happy?Maybe that is our lot living on this planet- there is no such thing as consistent perfection, and that, I suppose , holds our interest. I have the chairs set up like a damned intervention! But that is how it goes- ring around the big dog rug. It would be hilarious to prank some one- \"you think that you are here for Cara's baby shower but ...we have a van waiting right outside to take you to a rehab facility in Loma Linda, where you will be staying for the next three months.\" That show , so predictable, and short lived.

{"title": "killed by art", "date": "Wednesday, May 3, 2023", "text": "These two scissor-cut ornaments were in a flat envelope at the thrift store, never having been opened. I didn't know exactly what they were but picked them up for a dollar anyway.Made in Norway so of course they had to be something pretty great.  They were hand cut by Karen Bit Vejle, with her grandmother's tiny embroidery scissors. I looked her up- she does wall sized cut outs , by heart, one little mistake and the entire 6 months of work on one panel would be destroyed- yeah sure, I want to go through her destroyed pile!! Anyway, remarkable skill? Here is a link; HEREIt made me think of artists dying for their art- usually toxic chemicals in paints or resins-  artists ,too many to count,  have died from that, and there are a few who have died from large sculptures falling over on them. One Marco Gusimo for instance, who crafted a 100 foot crucifix in honor of Pope John Paul the two... it fell over on him and crushed him to death. Loads of performance artists get killed by their art- John Jaire Villamil's piece about Bogota- plastic garbage bag over his head , not sure how that is significant but he suffocated. Death by garbage bag! Clever.Another artist took a tiny sailboat out to sea- never was found.Pippa Bacca hitchhiked from Italy to the Balkans, rather, that was her artistic intent, in a wedding dress- half way  there she was raped and murdered.Giuseppe Francisci died from gasses while making glass and stained glass.Heavy metals in art supplies usually kills the artist, eventually , and of course there is always resin, fiberglass and formaldehyde, killing too many artists to list. I am thinking that Karen Bit's art form is relatively safe- does one ever die of a paper cut? Maybe by 1,000 paper cuts as in Japanese torture, but scissoring huge paper cut -outs seems a good medium to work with.And that brings to mind this- last night I  was compelled to look up local obituaries and  facebook to see if anyone had died, Sure enough one of my artist  friends from way back in the day, living in the harbor had died. He, too,  was killed by his art.  He carved internationally prized pipes out of rare wood and bone and whatever else  made a gorgeous piece- he did smoke them to make sure that they drew nicely even though his pipes were works that one might keep behind glass. Lung cancer that took off to brain and spine , he quit smoking after a heart attack , but did he really- sort of doubt it. He was a man who enjoyed a good cigar as well. Beware of your art!This is NOT coffee- Mr. Squeeze- The- Life- Out- Of- Everything  runs water through the grounds until there is no oomph left- he likes very weak so called coffee, Mr. Frugal. Shades of the depression era, I reckon. If he liked to drink tea , I am sure that the tea would be the rich color of air by the end of it. Waste not! I wasted some dollars on flowers for the party- baby's breath, lots of it!It does not stay plump for very long - light and airy- and sweet like real baby's breath  , turns into crispy little balls on the tips of thin stalks. I like it at all stages. Pointillist art?  After gathering flowers I went to the dollar store to get more of Mary Moon's cleaning supply- Fabuloso! The fragrance is so fresh I could dab it on my pulse points and call myself fancy-take -me-out-on-the-town Darlin'.  Tomorrow i will use all two bottles I am sure, There is much cleaning to do."},

Unusual at that time for anyone to come around unless it is an emergency.  I opened the door expecting a neighbor in need. No one there. At my feet a paper cone full of tulips and a wish , \"Happ may day\". I hollered to the bushes where I suspected the May Day faerie was hiding- \"Thank you, oh wondrous May day sprite\".  Brought them in to give them the blue vase treatment. The little lad down the street  was the faerie this time.And yes, the rains came. Petals of tender plants not particularly enjoying the down pour - yellow poppy - especially weighed down by the heavy drops. Petunias do not like the rain either, like soggy lettuce in the bottom of a grocery store salad,  wilted and discolored. Who loves the rain?Ducks . There were a pair of mallards in the back last night, something that has never happened before. The man duck watched - high alert- for  possible danger, as the egg layer scooped up fallen seeds and  the kibble softened  by  rain.  He is such a good man duck, attentive and sincere, protecting his woman so that they can continue making ducks in the future. And so it is in nature....sometimes. Getting the house ready for the baby shower - one step forward two steps back as  one spot is cleared another rapidly fills back up with shite from living...magazines, books, tools, work gloves, the usual.  Mud tracked in, crumbs from breakfast, splats from spilled coffee- I like to get a head start but probably should just deal with it the day before the party and make a rule for the day- \"Don't NOBODY move, or so much as breathe in this space!!\". I do not think anyone but me cares anyway. It is all about the baby and the mom and well wishing friends , who minds that floor is caked with god knows what?The orphans have been helpful, bringing to the table a bit of reality- NOT an angel from the heavens, the stork , the cabbage patch- but a howling infant that will not be consoled. The orphans fashioned a romper from a  1960's cocktail glass cover. That works to warm the infant, but still there are howls. \"Oh well\", they say,\" we will take it fishing, that should cheer it up.\" \"A nap\", I suggest, and so nap it is.Drowned petunia. I hope the weather improves for the party, ordering a bit of sunshine, please.  I have already eaten most of the Non Pariel, bought some more- will not open them until five minutes before guests arrive, I can not be trusted."},

This is her pleased as punch, regal expression,  French! The terrible plastic chairs that have dwindled from six to  three, having spent their chair lives being forts and GI Joe barricades and whatever else the kids came up with- been painted three times, this time the paint job is not  acceptable and they will be headed to chair afterlife when this summer ends.  They have existed on the deck for about fifteen years, not bad for cheapo plastic chairs! They are chipped and dinged and the paint job is really horrid up close - they are still great for butts and they did take their fashion sense from the poppies. So, not entirely lame.I scrubbed the deck with Fabulosa and white vinegar, following Mary Moon's lead. I can only find it at the dollar store - it must be toxic but smells heavenly and takes a year's worth of  bird poo, slime and dirt off in a few thousand swishes. I used a brush as well.I cleaned the bird feeder but the bottle brush got stuck and  broke everything. Off I went to Ace to get another. All of the bird feeders were poorly designed, our old one came from Audubon. Ace  had cutesy ones that are more for people than for birds. I bought one that is satisfactory until...Oh - look, Dennis fixed the old one ! He is a great fixer of objects- so now we have two bird feeders. The one I bought is very pleasing to the squirrel and the black headed gros beak.Chickadees and finch seem to like the old one better.So , everyone is happy!The purple finch is not at all purple.Looks insulted that some one has labeled him purple when clearly he is rose.Across the cul- de -sac our neighbor's tree is showing off big time. Pity that he travels for work so much so that he is rarely here to enjoy this perfect season of spring.  Well, I say \"perfect\" but two days of sunshine does not a perfect spring make!  Rain for the next few days, so sayeth the forecast Lord. I am pretty much over the dark rain and the chill to the bone weather- besides I got too happy about the sunshine and put my woolly layers away.  Tricked ever bloody year, I never learn. Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me all the time every time....Finches having a natter over lunch. So that's that, Prince Charles and Camilla will not be watched in this house as we find them unprepossessing, particularity the notion of  Tampon Prince and the  Rottweiler , as is their love story.

Until the damned coal train came- the tracks are right along the shore . Great for the engineers driving the train, it is  a beautiful run, but anyone eating al fresco or any of the millionaires condos above  get blasted. I stuck the flowers in pots right away , hope that the weather holds so that they do not get frozen. I wanted the deck to look reasonable for the baby shower a week from tomorrow. Though the forecast says rain on that day- folks on the deck may not be happening.These are the leftovers from last year. Chives about to flower, looking extremely cute with their little bobble heads.In the morning I counted ten  Lesser Gold Finches at the feeder and in the cherry tree. Just passing through , I reckon, lighting up the tree with their striking golden ways...They are called \"lesser\" not because they are less, as in inferior , but because they are smaller- they are short and round.They do not mate for life, every year is a fresh romance. Life span of three to six years. They do recognize human faces so be sure to smile at them and at least look lovingly and fondly at them, they are quite sensitive.This morning we talked about the plans for Cara's baby shower, she , in the middle, going to have a cousin for Flora Jane. We are all wishing that they would move to town so that we can adore her child as well as Flora Jane, I don't know...Flora is a tough act to follow.-0-Listening to tributes for Harry Belafonte, I remember how fond of this album I was when I was 19. I had five albums that I stacked on my stereo, this was one of them. Great study music, by the end of the album I would have at least made a dent in the mountain of work I had to have done by noon the next day. Every professor acted like his was the only class you might have to keep up with- you remember- so much reading, so much writing, so much research, so much coffee. Anyway, Nana Mouskouri's voice is another that makes one believe that humans might be OK....and that goddesses walk among us.

I rather like that idea of the old crabs living with the new borns.  A Camellia bush's blossoms on a  garden pedestal- like they planned it or something,  the rain and wind  made this lovely display. I thought that this was some sort of azalea or rhody relative, Looked it up on my phone- Japanese Andromeda, it is, but you probably already knew that.  A beauty.Flora Jane got her oaty beverage, Kim and I had americanos, plus a scone and a cookie.  Flora is interested in coffee...when we were not looking she did help herself to Kim's.  She may be a live wire tonight for her Mama. She has a mouth nearly  full of teeth now, I knew that you were just dying to know...and they are the most beautiful little mouth stones I have ever seen. Walked back through the neighborhood, utterly charming  it is too. Chatted with the neighbor about her garden - the guy that lives next door  makes me want to dump round-up on his lawn, such a meanie. Called the city to \"report\" the woman for a messy garden and a tree growing one inch over the alley way. What a jerk, The city did come and told her the job must be done or they will send someone to do it and send her the bill. Jerk is likely a Magat.No other explanation .I just got home and the door bell rang- the little girls next door brought me bouquets that they had picked. So sweet! They were so proud of this gift. Lucy, the oldest said that she loved blue bells, and as luck would have it, this morning I noticed one struggling through the front porch . I gave it to her. she thought it interesting how the flowers of blue bells did not look up at the sun, like other flowers. They look at their feet. Flowers, sunshine and little girls- so encouraging I think I may live another day.I awoke with such a sadness, for the earth and for beautiful children just coming into this messed up time- listened to Israel Kamakawiwo'ole for about an hour, heaping more melan on  my melancholy mood. So, going to Flora Jane's , seeing Emily and Kim certainly changed the direction of that! Whew! Good medicine! IZ  takes my heart to a place of utter beauty and despair. We were on Maui , I had never heard that voice  before. In a book shop  \"Aloha Ka Manini\"  and \"Kaleohano\"played - hit my heart like a cupid's arrow the size of a truck. Stopped me dead in my tracks, that voice!  I just had to find that man and give him a hug, all of my money, everything I hold sacred, THAT VOICE!!! Only to find out that he had died, age 38, just one year before. Music is magic- great music is transcendental. He does make me weep, and love hard and FEEL so deeply.Lovely IZ. The man of the islands."},

Fairy land! Speaking of fairy land, Stella has been helping her mice keep their house tidy, she works for them. The rewards are massive! The entire mouse house is upstairs in Stella's room of tiny magic and  joy.  While Stella is designing rooms for her mice I am minding the orphans,though they do not have their own house or their own rooms, They have the neighborhood. Remember I mentioned Steve's bird bath that has been  overtaken by creatures and the doll that ended up in a raccoons mouth? The orphans timed their fishing trip well as no body was there other than Mr. robot , He is docile enough, just stands around murmuring \"xxxzzzzt, rrr\".One fish caught and released, the same fish that is caught every time.This morning the gardener found a wee girl living in a walnut shell .Weather still too cold and rainy to plant anything- I have been clearing our drawers- Five of them yesterday and a closet today. Polished the wooden furniture , fed the leather chairs, grocery shopped, which was a mistake because I had not yet had breakfast- everything purchased was eaten in the car on the way home. I am out of control.Evening arrives and I start U- tubing lectures and the London guide, Joolz, whom I adore.  I think I have watched ALL of his guiding around the city as well as his trip to Pitcairn Island , where the mutineers left their captain and ship and lived on the tiny island until, I dunno, they perished from being piratey? It is a harrowing sort of frustrating trip and well worth the watch, Joolz is most entertaining. His tours through London are the best ever! Loads of information. he is way too talented and handsome and clever to be heterosexual pretty sure. If he is not gay, he really ought to be. He is a tasty dish.I got involved watching a debate last night- the one titled, \"Would we be better off without Religion\".  (Hell yes, I say) Religion came into being around 40,000 years ago as that was the time of creative explosion, gifts were left for the dead, burials happened...and after 40,000 years of god inventions, humans became hardwired for religion, ritual,performance expression, transcendental satisfaction.  Atrocities  committed in the name of  whatever idea of god is trending became the crux, the power, and not the glory.... So, in the end, 59% of the audience backed the evidence based consideration that we would be better off without religion , 31 % - the other side,  the rest, undecided. Critics generally agree that religion is outdated, harmful to the individual, harmful to society, an impediment to the progress of science or humanity, a source of immoral acts or customs, a political tool for social control.  The debate, presented on Intelligence Squared, is definitely worthy.As though that was not enough stimulation I watched Lawrence Krauss chatting with Richard Dawkins on the stage of the Opheum theater. Brilliant guys bouncing Neitzsche, Wittgenstien, JG Frazier ,etc- around like hot potatoes gone cold, gone mash.. Sleeping, after all of that ,was not an option. I cleaned out another drawer.  Not enough writing implements! Not enough safety pins!Just the right number of Dragon.AND the best news of the day other than little Tucker Crazy Pants getting the boot is this:Critics of religion in general may view religion as one or more of: outdated, harmful to the individual, harmful to soc, an impediment to the progress of science or humanity, a source of immoral acts or customs, a political tool for social control.Critics of religion in general may view religion as one or more of: outdated, harmful to the indmful to society, an impediment to the progress of science or humanity, a source of immoral acts or customs, a political tool for social con"},

Separated from its flock above the wall, managing to survive. This year the flock has expanded and is looking very well- loves the rain and cooler temperatures. Deer do not eat them, rabbits do not eat them, they are  the only bulbs to actually make it in our un-fenced smorgasbord.  The mystery of the ratty haired doll has been solved. The little neighbor girls  and their Dad have made a \"fountain\" from the other neighbor Steve's bird bath squirt-er thing. Steve supplied the fountain and the water hook up and some of the toys that call it home. The doll came from Steve. The raccoons love this little fountain as well, they kidnapped the princess , took her as their own, decided that she was too demanding and did not taste good - that is why I found her in the yard. The little girls decided, to make sure that that did not happen again,  put her high up in a tree with a giraffe to protect her, to everyone's relief. I am not sure what may be living or dying in the so called squirrel house. It is likely full of bones and not particularly welcoming. Flickers started to make a nest in our roof again, but the damned starlings gave them the boot and now are being the bosses of the world, as they do.The hole up in the roof needs to be blocked off- Dennis is forbidden to climb tall ladders over concrete, due to blood thinners and gravity.  I am too inept to do that task, so OK, starlings , you creepy little rat birds, you can have it.   We will deal with it after your little delinquents have hatched and are flying.One of my newly found college mates sent some photos of us spending days by the river when we were 18-19 years old. We did have a great time, there was beer involved I am sure. We were always together like one unit!The harsh , constant , brassy  sunshine of Wyoming , out in it all day everyday, has done its worst. Pretty sure this thing on my cheek is a cancer and I must go have it dealt with. In order to do that I must make an appointment with my \"care provider\" doctor, she has retired and there is no one with any room for new patients or the time for the patients that they do have. I only need a referral to a skin guy- but have to go through a load of nonsense to get there.  If I wanted to pay out of pocket without insurance involved I could probably do that...I thought...but NO, you must have a referral- Got you by the short curlies this so-called \"health care\" system. Little wonder why this country is so cranky.Here we are frying in the sun....no regrets, until now.The medical shite up here is aggravating at best. As an example, Kim's renter who rents her cottage by Kim's house, went to the ER for lung issue and a mysterious swelling of arm and leg, Put on antibiotics and shifted to intensive care, unable to speak or walk or anything that resembles life- they are dealing with her lung infection but are mystified by the crazy swelling...Stabilized her lungs and shifted her to HDU. Yesterday, the discharge person told her \"You can go home now, we will be discharging you with the IV left in so you can do your own medication.\" This  patient , semi comatose now,  lives in a tiny cottage with a bathroom across the garden, wood heat, rather primitive.  The girl can not even get up out of bed  now, let alone walk or speak.  REALLY? This hospital , Saint bloody Joe's, is one of the worst. Anyway , her doctor said, \"no\". She must stay for a bit longer, she is having some sort of surgical procedure this morning to try to figure out the swelling bit. Also this patent is young, and fit, a yoga instructor so the negligence of hospital staff is not ageism.  I am not sure what it is. So, stay well y'all. Don't get sick in Bellingham if you can help it."},

She slept another hour and a bit on my chest. I sang to her- got the notes to vibrate soothingly in my chest and off she went into dreamland with all the little finger twitches and kicks. Awoke not feeling well, and she did cry.Not sure what it was that came on so suddenly, Maybe teeth. This morning she is just fine- ready to go another round. Emily sent a video.On my way over yesterday I stopped by thrift store and for the price of a cup of coffee, bought the very old Swiss bucket, built shaker style,  and two original  Nils Olsson Dala horses. Charming! With underbelly stickers from Sweden still pristine , signed by the artist. Remember, it is not about need!  It is about treasure and clutter and things to keep dusted and oiled, it is about being an old granny with too much stuff that will make the survivors grumble- \"how could she live like this\".Flora will probably like these little horses when she is older, like MY AGE! That will be a long wait and I will be long gone. and who knows what the state of the world will be in by then- Climate headed toward a new age-  not really \"new\", but  more abrupt! In warmer climate  mammals become smaller,  horses became chiwawa size in paleo-climate history , shrinking down from a reasonable three feet high to pocket size.   Flora is evolution at work, preparing for a hotter earth, being small is survival. Plus being the smartest baby ever will certainly help. Rhubarb is growing in her neighborhood on nearly every corner. Sweet houses with small organic gardens , narrow side walks that are crumbling a bit. Quiet , well established, hip young folks doing their best to live small. It is good.A metal chair by the trash to be taken- If it is still there today I will have it, It is too good for landfill!  More stuff for the hoard? Off I go, another lovely day with smart baby hoping the bug has passed or whatever it was. Probably making more teeth- a hard job!"},

A friend since I was 24,  22 years older than I but we have gotten into trouble just the same as  a couple of  naughty adolescence, along the way.Under her influence , some bad decisions were made, and some of the best life changing ones , too.She said that she would live to be at least 100, everyone believed it , she had secret powers. Well, not so secret really, more up front and out there- more of an \"I get what I want\" sort of non secret! I have had some of my best times with this woman!  Not an affectionate person and a sort of MYOB  arms length friend, rarely engaging in your concerns as \"I have troubles of my own- you will figure it out, lets have a bowl of ice cream peanuts  on top and instant coffee- fixes everything\"...But sometimes , in a pinch, she might help , sort of. Like bring jello if one had a tummy ache. I have learned a great deal from her- no molly coddling allowed- pick yourself up and do the best you can- get on with it with what you have. \"If you do not even  have a dime for a cup of coffee- drink water, it's better for you.\"Sage...Pat at the age when we met in Port Townsend.Convinced me at this time to stay in the Ham instead, after the boat sailed away...and help her raise a pig, finish my degree, act in plays, sing in choirs,  do art, learn how to sew better. Good decisions.  I realize after her first stroke that I had lost her. Her sharp mind and wit and ability to reason- gone,  her demanding controlling manipulative personality remained,  full force. I reckon she had ADHD but there was no diagnosis for that in our world, so when the stroke robbed her of any sort of filter- well, you know- unleashed some shite behavior.   I did my grieving then, so last night at about 10:30 I got a text from her daughter in law that Pat  had just checked out altogether. We both sighed with relief. I am not sad. Pat fell a few weeks ago , had a brain bleed due to blood thinners and never really came back- or when she did she was utterly lost.  So that's it , Pat, off you go. Missing you but I have been missing you since the first stroke - no news there. See you later old friend, in the cosmos where we have always been. -0- Raccoon basking in  brief sunny sunrise, and then the rain did come down- buckets, bonking petals and blossoms off of the tree.

I brought it in and washed it- still looks wild and weird but that is just the nature of this object I guess. If the little girls do not claim it I will give it to the orphans.For the last two minutes of the so called daylight, this light occurred, and then everything went dark again. We are to have a few more days of this icky weather. I will be minding Flora, the smart baby,  for a few hours this week so that  will improve my soggy attitude. Sunday of nothing - I can feel the nothingness to the bone like a life suck. Dennis managed to get out and walk around the lake in the rain and mud. He said that since he has not walked around the lake for a good long while that- pretty sure -the lake has expanded and the path around it has lengthened.

Little kids loved him. I loved him, everyone did. The battle for gun reform continues but you know the gun lobby owns the GOP and most of congress. Screaming second amendment rights  twisted into their own  sick and insane version of \"guns for everyone, no responsibility no understanding no training no anything\".Bang Bang Shoot Shoot- happiness......My friend wrote this book about a man, a \"shooting gentleman\", who bred hunting dogs and did very well in his lifetime understanding  gun and dog. I am conflicted as I have never been a fan of shooting live things for the hell of it. His was \"sport and science\" though birds must have thought it was not especially sporty.

Fresh ones added daily.My friend sent a photo of the box of tiny dollies that she found in California in the sun, which had melted  in an interesting way....She arranged them in her wagon of shrooms and moss, to live out their little melted plastic lives  on the counter, being admired by all who see.There is also a melted giraffe in there for them to ride when they get tired of peering out at the big world. One of the dollys is  named  Henry, He has a place of honor and can ride the giraffe any time he wants- he gets first dibs and will be kept safe with his chums, in the soft moss, in a wagon, on the counter, forevermore."},
{"title": "venom, Yellow, ouch", "date": "Friday, April 14, 2023", "text": "Attention-grabbing: Since yellow is the most visible color, it is also the most attention-getting color. Yellow can be used in a small amount to draw notice, such as on traffic signs or advertisements.Difficult to read: Yellow is also the most fatiguing to the eye due to the high amount of light that is reflected. Using yellow as a background on paper or computer monitors can lead to eyestrain or vision loss in extreme cases.Energetic: Yellow can also increase metabolism.Frustrating: Yellow can also create feelings of frustration and anger. While it is considered a cheerful color, people are more likely to lose their tempers in yellow rooms and babies tend to cry more in yellow rooms.Warm: Yellow is a bright color that is often described as cheery and warm.   Accompanied by the synthetic sound of Cleopatra’s ethereal voice, this hypnotic yellow  environment devised from poisonous black  mamba  python  venom, evokes Cleopatra’s  death  and  acts  as  a reminder  of  nature’s lethal powers.Probably the strangest and most dangerous installation I have ever seen. I came out of the venom colored room blinded.  For real! It took about an hour and a half to regain my vision in the coffee shop. Three pastries and two cups of tea later I could see out of one eye, enough to catch a bus back to the flat. But on the way...THIS! I can not remember why the Piccadilly sign was more blinding yellow than anything in nature but there it was. OUCH.    https://youtu.be/eYSB737hPxQ  maybe it was the anniversary of Yellow rainbow? Whatever, that much yellow is harmful and I do understand  babies crying in yellow rooms- That day in London - one of the worst!What brings this to mind is- today while driving into town, a young woman was walking along the sidewalk all pink from top to toe, like bazzooka bubble gum , pepto bouncing along bee bopping to Pink. Generally that much pink is upsetting I find but just enough of a pink splash to make my day more cheerful! I came home , looked up the color PINK,  generally a soothing happy safe color which then lead me to Yellow- (bright dandelions along the way)...then I remembered my yellow venom experience so that is that. That is how the mind works , one thing leading to another.  Sorry, terrible isn't it! Terrible music to accompany this post- perfect!

I went straight to the \"ugly \" part. Appreciating ugly at a level of interest - non comparable value. Sometimes it is a struggle , immediately jumping into judgement and revulsion. That is normal. There is a reason for that in nature. Art may be a different thing, though. I know of an artist who sculpts fabric and found objects together which at first glance looks rubbish.  Closer inspection reveals the marvel of her work, the stitches, the rust and dirt, its life,  like poetry , aging objects- over all , from a distance, it looks like guts hanging and there is no color to bail it out...but, given some measure of study the works are mighty!

The cherry blossoms being blown to the neighbor's yard,  cold wind bending branches and making the birds work harder for a living! I saved the tulips and put them in a jar.In The Aesthetic Value of the World , Tom Cochrane defends Aestheticism, the claim that everything is aesthetically valuable and that a life lived in pursuit of aesthetic value can be a particularly good one. Furthermore, in distilling aesthetic qualities, artists have a special role to play in teaching us to recognize values; a critical component of virtgrounds his account upon an analysis of aesthetic value as 'objectified final value', which is underwritten by an original psychological claim that all aesthetic values are distal versions of practical values. This is followed by systematic accounts of beauty, sublimity, comedy, drama, and tragedy, as well as appendix entries on the cute, the cool, the kitsch, the uncanny, the horrific, the erotic, and the furious."},

I used the credit card to apply paint and mess around. and a Q-tip.  I thought that I had tossed these long ago in my getting rid of stuff frenzy.  Glad I didn't , they are a good reminder about using what one has on hand to create whatever. They are not meant to be anything other than playing around with a  broken credit card but I think , in spite of that ,they are OK. and the layering is rather nice. Interesting texture. As for artistic merit there may be none but it was fun to play with- up in the attic of the fancy Holland Park  house! Looking forward to another trip. I have been reading about air travel lately- clear air turbulence is another climate change danger!Climate change facts, here we go.It is a very good factual article about air turbulence, the dangers of and the possibility of NASA inventing a detector.  Adaptation is key.Stella is leaving for  Finland this summer for only three weeks, but she has a little dog who needs her so...short trip.

Bread addiction is my favorite addiction, especially since opium is illegal...Bread is a soother and makes me so fat that I could steady a plane in turbulence- pretty sure. I really do not mind being a fatty when I am alone. Other people fat shaming  ( as Dennis does) makes me feel terrible as if being a fatty is criminal and I have committed something worse than murder of a child or something.  Fuck that!Body shaming is the crime.

We have never been able to park a car in the garage- it has always looked like this, even after it has been cleaned up . For about twenty minutes it was! Every time there is an empty spot it gets filled. That is how it works.I could say that I am just as guilty of hoarding crap, but I am not. These paintings under the bed took up exactly 9\"X6\" X 1/2 inch. and now I am willing to toss them having seen them again. The last one looks like covid.Hoarding is a strange mindset. Maybe it is a fear of not having enough, a product of growing up poor and wanting? I must take that into consideration."},

When the mother flew off to get more wormy dinner for her baby, the little one waited for her but got bored . It stared to pluck all of the blossoms from the cherry and watched as they fell. Cutest thing i have seen all week. Pleased with its pile of blossoms on the deck- \"job well done\".  Stella and I went out for lunch. New ownership and a new decorator that , we both agreed, chose light fixtures that did not fit. Especially the large black granny shades over the hanging  bulb.  The seats are so soft that the table came up to our chins. BUT the chowder was great and at that height we could just scoop it in.Stella gave the orphans a whole bunch of new dresses, Vintage and hand made and cuter than they look in this shot of some of them, there were more dresses than orphans. They came with the usual thoughtful easter basket from our Stella, full of chocolate bunnies and eggs and an easter elf. She is too good that Stella!Night before last i tried to make hot cross buns.They are tasty but I forgot the salt and the cross part only worked on two  of them. Trial run.I will make them again tomorrow to take to Son's house for that Sunday when bunnies and eggs and chickies are celebrated. Hyacinths are up in the front yard. Purple ones are just coming up - that is your hyacinth report for the day.From the deck with my point and shoot, plump moon face sings its \"OHHHHH\" song. And then night fell.Not bad for a point and shoot. Even the sparkly bits of moon that are taller than the dark bits showed well. Came in as the night got colder- watched \"The Story Of Europe\" , a DOC presented by Sir Christopher Clark. He is a good presenter and the series was worth the binge though the acted bits of history were laughable- acting so poor one might think it was done by a christian film maker. The history , of course, is terrible and chock full of testosterone, ego-centrism, greed, religion and war. There are no female influencers,  yeah, a queen here and there but only for short spells, and they did not have penises with which to duel. big surprise! The patriarchy has damned near destroyed us  , give them another five minutes and the job will be done.   However, our governor has just done a marvelous thing- State purchase of three-year supply of mifepristone to protect access to medical abortion.  Perhaps in three years this nation will have come to some sensible realization that Roe V Wade was one of the best things to ever happen for Women's health and care.  If the orange thug is eliminated , marched through the streets as poo is flung,  and the states  of brain/spirit disease  (maga) , find a remedy for their illnesses, we might be able to live another day to enjoy cherry blossoms, baby bird shenanigans, and the round face of the moon.  I dunno, too optimistic?Also a  bit of  good news, basic flip phones  on fleek at the moment!  A backlash against cell phones owning our population especially the youth who have been made mentally /emotionally compromised, dangerously so, due to constant , steady use of cell  phones plugged into social media. Flip phones may call or text but nothing fancy, like making the user mentally ill, suicidal or feeling anxiety every waking moment.  Flip phone , deff my choice!"},
{"title": "Walk into town with me", "date": "Sunday, April 2, 2023", "text": "The sun came out in the afternoon. Knowing that rain would soon follow I put on my walking boots and headed into town. Down through the neighborhood, you may recognize as it rarely changes.Although there is a \"new\" bike in the yard where my friend has a tiny apple orchard and a prehistoric mystery plant that comes up, on its own, in a different location in the yard every year. And every year she exclaims \"What the fuck is that?\" The trans and LBGQ with all of the other initials- are also well represented through the neighborhood. Banners and flags, signs and memorials have sprouted in yards. As usual spring has a difficult labor. It was winter the night before, freezing , rain, frost, and wind, shaking things up and off of the branches. Petal confetti.The path leading to town took me right into the middle of  a celebration on the street. A street party -beer and wine, dancing, dogs, and music. I have not seen this many people in Fairhaven for , what is it now, three years? Immunity is up but the virus keeps mutating and folks are still becoming ill from it.  Nothing like the old days though- the existential  terror  has no power over us.Thank you Dr. Fauci and all of the geniuses behind the jab.There were more dogs in tow than people at the street party. I love this one especially, and at first thought it to be a Brittany spaniel. She is an English setter. Lovely breed. The only thing about both Brittany and Setter is that they need at least an hour (longer preferably) a day of outdoor running/play/bird chasing exercise. They are curious and get bored, so if the human is not up to intense exercise, the dog will find a way to take the house down. Walking along- J/J/ Donovan has acquired a new hat. A really nice one! Hand knit out of the softest wool ever. It looks newly made and was tempting to take - I did not, but the thought occurred.J.J. Donovan built  RR  access to get coal for another county to Bellingham or visa versa. It is a pleasant enough statue. I like that he is holding a letter to his wife._The statue includes a replica of an actual letter from J.J. Donovan to his wife Clara.  In the letter, J.J. is describing the four towns on Bellingham Bay:  Fairhaven, Bellingham, Sehome and Whatcom.  The town of Bellingham would soon become part of Fairhaven later that year.  In 1904 a City of Bellingham would be formed when Fairhaven and Whatcom were consolidated._There are three statues sitting around Fairhaven, and a large mural that takes up the entire side of a building, the artist painted himself into the mural at street level.  Startlingly real!A good portion of the mural is painted  as a white screen where, in the summer, people sit on the green and watch movies for free.I lived in Fairhaven well  before gentrification and so preferred the old Fairhaven!It is an entirely different place now, with money and glitz, way too many tourists and now GD parking meters!! That is the final straw!The phone box in dire need of attention and repair, still stands where it has always been. I think it is now just a pee box. It used to have a pay phone in it that functioned well and could call 911 if needed. One day we were having lunch outside on the grass , one of the little kids went into the box and damned if she did not call 911 repeatedly.  After that they took the phone out and it became the pee box it is now. I would love to rescue it, put it in the garden for the raccoons.Walking on, by the bay. Geese have come to boss around the ducks and gulls,and to leave massive poos on the silt. But aren't they cute?Walked up through Maggie's yard, full of blossoms. they do not last a very long time but in early spring they are a welcome sight! after no color at all, just long grey misty blah days suddenly - PINK!   Already petals  are falling downhill into the ditch. Seems that the flowers are so brief- their only purpose is to decorate the ditch.Delicate little fairy boats.By the time I got back into the kitchen the sky was as pink as Maggie's blossoms. Gorgeous  above our blossoming plum. The plum was a birthday present for Erik when he was 8 years old. He will be 36 in a few days!So, that was a day in the life . A very good April greeting with massive poos, music on the street, petals in the ditch. Another lovely walk."},

I had given her some baby things and she sent this wonderful little thank you. Check the size of the grapes! They are fabulous- like a whole different fruit! Dennis gets them at his church- Cost Co.I do love the fragrance and brightness of the daffodils, the whole house smells like a flower shop. The color is magnificent, especially in the Assistance League vase. The blue of the vase has just been waiting for daffodils, I do believe!A while ago I was playing with stuff on my table, stuck it  together, painted it, and for some  good reason it ended up in a bottom drawer , not yet ready for the recycle bin, I guess. I was experimenting with texture of tissue paper squished into  branches and layering. Unsuccessful but I did learn a thing. I learned that one can not put a branch  behind a flat painted face. There are some sections of this that I like so may tear those parts off to use elsewhere. Not today- the sun has mysteriously appeared after a night of blustery winter! Think a walk might be a good thing to do while the sky is blue."},

Trader Joe's has the best flowers for the best price, IF you can get in and out of the parking lot without ending up in the E.R.The flowers that look good sitting next to the flowers that do not, the ones that do not are from Cost Co.

He gave me three articles. This was one. His navy shirt from when he was 18 and very tiny. So that would be 1955 I am thinking-I would have been in the third grade. Anyway, I took it out of the pile of three and will be saving it for another 80 years, I suppose, as if anyone will be around by then, right?I did not come home empty handed.Taking things in was a great excuse to go back to get this thing that I did not buy the last time I was there- I had a think about it. My think told me to bring it home. It is made of  tiny tufts of fur (mouse?rabbit?dog? cat?) knit into this neck warmer. At first I thought it was feathers because it feels a bit like the quills have been left in. Closer examination reveals that the quill feeling is actually minuscule hide - tiny tufts knitted into wool, sweet. What am I going to do with it? Dunno but who cares- there are nukes floating about as well as  so much madness, and the earth is shaking us off- so, eat  all of the pie, buy a baby bunny neck warmer, live until you die!-0-Afternoon I watched our Flora for about five hours or so. That child is too much fun- into all things all at once but easily distracted if one thing is not especially good for an 18 month old. She did try to teach her toy Orca how to swim in the dog's water bowl ,  and , with excellent precision, dumped all of it- on her , the floor and everything within a six foot radius. The house is old, and slanted, made more obvious by the river flowing downhill toward the cupboards.  She was drenched - did not mind at all, but the dog was worried, tip toeing around with an \"Oh NO, am I in trouble?\" look . Here are a couple of her photos that she took with my phone, her favorite thing to dink with...Teaching the dog about - not sure- but clearly something that held their interest for one minute.  She has a few real English words now but still laughs when I make her dolly say Goo goo Gah Gah. She thinks that is hilarious. Her dolly is not smart.I called Erik while I was there to show him a little video of Flora in action. He got laid off yesterday so is home , making bread. He is eating it with tons of melted butter and rosemary, thinking about nukes and the madness of the world- Why not eat fresh hot bread with loads of butter? I can think of no reason not to.A fifty cent bag full of scrap fabric plus a generous piece Mexican oil cloth, bright and happy. I might make an uncomfortable cushion  for the little uncomfortable Mexican chair for Flora. It's a bitch to sew but now that I have my machines in working order I should get it done in no time. I have a jar full of swears to throw at this project."},
{"title": "downtown and a film", "date": "Sunday, March 26, 2023", "text": "A friend and I went to the movies this afternoon. We went to see \"The Quiet Girl\".  Visually superb, the cinematography is splendid,  acting believable , charming. The story is a rather sad/happy one of an Irish family with too many kids and a louse for a husband/father. One child, the Quiet one, is sent to live with distant relatives for the summer while the mother has yet another baby and the husband continues his terribleness . It is a gentle , subtle film and gets you where you live. We agreed to make up our own ending that satisfied us but still left with tears in our eyes.  Downtown today, partly cloudy but warm enough for just one jacket. Quiet Sunday, quiet film and a good natter with an old friend. A warning though , If you do go see The Quiet Girl, know that her father  probably has abused the child sexually  at some point. Bed wetting and fear of the night are the only evidences , as I said , the film is subtle.  It is one of those immersion film experiences- never in your face raucous American  turn-down-the-volume-bullshit.  Irish with subtitles and genuine attention  to the \"feels\".  Beautiful. One that lingers deliciously, Ireland's country side , farm life and clean water...and there is a dog.Squirrel on the deck just now. It looks like it has been in some one's mouth and had to loose some suit to escape.Trend setter, maybe? He might be the one who gets the girl!"},

Either they were concerned about the girth of the woman buying the bread and considering her health, offering holes instead of substance, or the bread was not proved properly- or this is their idea of hole wheat bread. Whatever, I did not feel that I got my money's worth, though the bread is delicious, the holes , no so much.The night before ,I went out , happy hour with friends. One gave me a gift of a little book that is wonderful, dark, funny, and particularly appropriate during these \"end times\", (they say)... Every page has something of significance especially in my age group.Being this age, as well as Mom jeans, does afford  so much freedom to just be.  Forthright honesty is a thing, no pretense or pressure to look a certain pulled together , non sagging way and there is more self expression allowed. Mostly because no one judges you when you are elderly. Unless you are GOP, then all bets are off.Thinking to turn pain into Expression...but with temporary , wash off tats, because I do not like the idea of ink under my skin.Crafts are a non judgemental, cheap way of attempting to ART in the world.  Whatever is chosen as a medium , glue, bat, spray paint, napkins, crocheting  bog roll covers, macaroni necklaces, whatever gets our minds going in a meditative way that  can only be soothing , out of the box, creativity. Decorating (bashing) a cop car in the dead of night dressed like a raccoon sounds especially enticing/satisfying.Going to drag show, a gay bar , a straight bar, improv theater, getting to know your weirdo neighbors, Dressing down, dressing up. Going to where ever makes me feel uncomfortable and sussing out why I am feeling uncomfortable, dealing with that discomfort in a finger-pointing-back- at- self way, for better understanding. Going to a gallery full of questionable art without judging. Sit with it. Get to know it. These are things I will do more of.AND I will sit in my underpants till nightfall...The little book is basically about - This Succinct , right on the money, with a twist at the end. The cockroach working at Starbucks featured on a previous page, lives through  to continue working at Starbucks. A charming apocalyptic book, hilarious if you are in that frame of mind.Stella and I went out to get our hairs cut and then to the Ferry terminal for fish and chips . The hair cutter's salon is fabulous, The owner is from Mexico so, loads of color and Day of the dead art. Mexican cheer and light , Best music playing, excellent hair cutter. Could not find one reason to complain. I took a photo of something in a magazine to look  up online when I got home. It is this: The reviews were positive, though, some find that electrocuting the face is  unpleasantly zingy! Well, yeah, face is freaked out , cringing away from this frog looking  torture device, curling up in a tight fetal position! What we do to fight the ravages of age! Oh , Us women folk , just let it fugging be... not twenty years old looking for a mate, for godsake, nor are we bound by rags like the daily mail to present our best at all times. Who the hell cares? Apparently folks who pay $250.00 for face electrocution do. Besides, in the reviews, there was no one over the age of 25 saying positive things about this miracle Zap.  Magazines for women produced by greed preying on vulnerabilities and insecurities -a woman's curse since we began wearing stupid clothing- Fashion and those damned air brushed movie stars. Stick to what's real. What is important. I will if you will... and we will not die alone."},

Charlie snoozing on the sofa which is OK because he is the non allergic sort. He is clean and smells un -dog, and has very good manners. You may remember when Charlie stayed with me for a hundred walks a day? He is staying with Emily while his humans go for a swim in Hawaii.The sun came out,  LOOK! Charlie in the back yard, loving springtime just as much as any other guy. Flora has the coolest toys...I am envious of her toys, and when she outgrows them I may have to persuade her to let me borrow them . Although , she is expecting a cousin to get born  this summer - Charlie's humans are going to have a wee girl. Flora will pass on her stash to the new baby, probably.We went for a walk to get  a warm beverage and a ginger scone. Charlie watered the gardens along the way. I shared my scone with him and he agreed that it was one of the finest in the land.Flora was not terribly impressed - more interested in oat milk vanilla drink, Such a comfort and probably a lot like mother's milk. She is no longer nursing, so I imagine that warm oat milk is a soothing  substitute .-0-Today was senior day at the thrift shop, 30 percent off. I bumped into a dearest friend  whom I have not seen for a long while. We used to live together, work together and our boys played with each other when they were wee- born only a month apart. Our pregnancies were a surprise- we are older moms and really did not intend to have children at all. But there you go- both of us - all at once! Something in the water.Lucky day!  I came home with ... things.Cheap thrills. I can always take   back from whence it came without feeling regret.

Anything we could come up with  to avoid  P.E. and still get credit- Goals! We will get together sometime early April we reckon.  It will have to be a quick reunion/lunch so that Mary can avoid driving in the dark. It is not a pleasant drive . I refuse to drive to Seattle for any reason. Mary is a trooper, I say! I am very excited to  catch up on fifty years . If we can do that over one  lunch we are more amazing than the speed of light!Curious how I am collecting old friends all at the same time . How fortunate. Must mean that I am going to kick the bucket soon and must reunite a crowd so that my send off will be a well attended party.

Allergies are a thing- I have a friend who built his house out of true logs and then discovered that he was allergic to trees...Too bad, he had to plaster over the entire interior losing the esthetic of natural wood. I am sneezing but that is not unusual.  Genetics not allergies...Gardens protected (ha-ha) by fisherman's netting and bunting banners.It is cute but not terribly effective against garden raiders. You can see the deer in the shadows making a plan. I have posted Figaro before, he is the silliest little Corgi  who thinks he is BIG and ferocious. He is not. He is just protective of his garden. I have long admired his garden which his human has kept for years and years since back in the hippie days. The soil is like rich chocolate cake and he can grow anything and everything in that smallish space. He grows four inch long plump mulberries which I have never seen in this town.His  human was making breakfast on Monday morning, his other human had gone out of town to care for ill relative for a few days.His gardener human hit the floor , heart attack, died. Figaro stayed by his side, of course, for three days before some one checked on the human because- no activity...Then the other human came home. Oh dear! Surprises like this are shite!  I walked by Figaro's garden, as I was cruising the neighborhood,  he did not come up to the fence to tell me who's boss.  He just sat by the door looking over yonder in a far away stare.

So sorry...\"  -0-Came home and decided to go through my friend's art that I have in a portfolio, he had Parkinson's /dementia- thinking that maybe I could frame one and put it on the wall where the monster TV used to be.Instead I found a few that are hilarious. This one for instance!I think that his technique was to throw some paint down, scribble a bit and then come up with what it represented.(Golfing with your own skeleton, after stepping in some one else's picnic) Certainly worthy of a frame but alas is too small for the wall that I had in mind.I sticky tacked this one to the wall just to see if it might work. I decided that it will not fit the bill. Keep looking- some are very strange and why he thought they were exceptional may be due to dementia. They are all priced at $80.00.I managed to transport this hefty stationary bike from the garage up the stairs and into the room . It weighs a ton, but I moved it in pieces and VOILA! Dennis put it together because he is good at putting things together and I am SO not. I am good at lifting heavy objects! So now I have a recumbent bike, very quiet and I have ridden it twice , winded after fifteen minutes. That is how soft I have become.  Legs like soggy noodles. I will improve,I promise myself. Anyway, it is a good thing to do while I watch something on my computer- I watched all of Philomena Cunk episodes as well as the entire Winston Churchill movie, the old one with Anne Bancroft as Lady Randolph Churchill- Long and over the top  dramatic, hero worshippy but  a good one to ride a bike through.  Now I am baking a chicken. a bit leery of chicken now but will be mindful with this one.  Ain't got no time fo salmonella. By the way, so far I am very impressed with Harry's book!

They were moving around like ants scurrying to take everything to bare ground under the direction of the bossiest man ever.I think that this was in my subconscious mind due to a conversation we were having at Son's house yesterday- Dennis has plans for the yard, HIS plans, son asked, \"does Linda know about this? does she have any say?\" I answered that \"no, she does not.\" Pick your battles, friends...Above is the house  that burned down last night. built a few years before the one we live in, similar design, early 70's.I walked up to take a few shots this morning, The gas guys were there trying to find leaks.that is the roof melted over what used to be the bedrooms.The living room where he had his telescope to look out over the bay. three cars and a boat- BOOM! We don't know how it happened yet, just that the house is utterly destroyed and the people who lived there stood on the front stoop in shock , frozen, until neighbors dragged them out of there.  I hope that their insurance is sufficient! I decided to wash all of the floors today- on Mary Moon's recommendation of using Fabulous o and white vinegar. Oh yes, it does the job and smells wonderful. Thank you, Ms. Mary!"},
{"title": "FIRE~", "date": "Sunday, March 12, 2023", "text": "This just in!!! Holy cow, Awakened by a loud boom, thinking it was a bear on the deck, then a lot of shouting, got out of bed to see the neighbor up on the street above us has his house on fire. big time. Dennis is walking to the fire now. I will not wait up for his report. It is  11:00 pm, well past bedtime, even a fire this close can not have power over my bedtime! I would rather it have been a bear on the deck, but we do not get to choose, do we.Fire brigade dousing it now, Water sizzling.  Sparks no longer flying, Good thing it rained so heartily today!A short notice day. Our grand son's birthday sort of party a few miles south by the sea on a rainy mid morning. There were four eagles In their tree, a couple of biggins and two babies. We kept the dogs inside, not that the eagles would be interested especially but the dogs would bark them away.Daughter- In-law and son did put on a pretty great spontaneous party for the lad who is now 24! One orphan stowed away in my bag, found a strawberry cookie and was sure that all the fuss was about her. Beans, the dog knew better. Party was , of course, for him and his mate Coco. Sometimes  Beans is mistaken for carpet and the foot that falls on him is surprised to hear a \"YIP\".We all did eat too much, lounged around and five of the pilots went downstairs to the control center to simulate flight on an even larger machine than the one here. There was one crash and one emergency landing on a rooftop. No one died.This is nature's car wash on the way home- all the way, Rain did not let up even a little bit.After the wipers cleared the wind shield, I clicked my phone to show you the road and the splashiness. Particularly dangerous around the huge rock sides which can and do tumble on occasion. I did make it to the Daughter of Norway meeting yesterday. About as stimulating as your Granny's underwear drawer. Not my tribe, though I may join just to support them and make stuff for their fairs. In our town, growing up, every group of folks had names that I suppose would be considered xenophobic now, but , back then, were terms of endearment. Scandinavians were four cornered hat wearers/blockheads. Italians were \"Wops\" - with out papers -but really it comes from Italian \"Guappo\"-definitely a slur. No one knew that though. Italians were just \"Wops\". Mexicans were \"wet backs\"...implying that they entered the country by swimming across the Rio Grand- which of course they did not do...but that was just a term used , friend to friend...I am not even kidding. No one knew any different or any better it was just a way of describing someone- like adjectives- \"A blockhead toe head, pale eyed  Swede married her  handsome wrangler wet back fiance at the church this afternoon...\"  My Dad was the king of Archie Bunker-isms - we grew up  blockheads, a badge of honor , every other ethnicity had their names and unless there was mean spirited thinking behind them everyone was fine with their ethnic nickname.  A town where Women knew their place and girls threw like...girls.  Boys were naughty because they will be boys. It was the fifties, for chrise sake. Well, the fifties are well and truly over but some things die hard.As an introduction to the  Daughters of Snoreway, I had to tell a bit about why or how I was connected to the country, I did mention that my family had a fair share of blockheads from Norway and Sweden without even a glimmer of thought, just on automatic... the room went quiet...I had managed to offend the entire church basement full of elderly women. Whispering to one another \"did she say ...BLOCKHEADS?\" \"Yes I do believe she did\". I guess they thought it a negative thing but how could they? Weren't they all blockheads and proud of being from blockheadland?  They were gracious and did invite me to come back, though, so maybe they just knew that I was a throw back but it shocked their sensibilities. I hope I only offended, as ignorance can do, and did not hurt anyone's feelings. So that was that. It is still raining , very cold, and I am reckoning that one must truly be a blockhead to live in this area- in the truest Norwegian sense. A compliment, actually,   a great area in which to wear Dale of Norway woolens and eat butter. Perfect."},

It is always empty by sundown. Last night there was a hornet on the sill. alive but not lively- sort of frozen and wondering if it had the wrong date. \"Yes\", I told it, it is still winter- go to sleep, or just die now because you are a hornet. He is still dopily meandering along the sill. \"There is no future for you\", I told him. Pretty sure I will find crispy dead him on the floor this afternoon. I found this list in my Trudy discoveries, we had to come up with a way to fulfill P.E. requirements so we invented a softball team. We called ourselves the sidewalks because every other team walked all over us.We actually played one real game. The results were predictable....Then My friend and I decided that we wanted to go to Hutchinson Kansas on an airplane with the basket ball team and the only way we could do that was to be part of the cheer-leading squad, but there were already cheerleaders that knew  moves and yells and chants- we knew nothing. We just wanted a plane ride paid for by the college, and to get out of town- we invented Pom Pom girls- We got outfits and pom poms ,also paid for by the college, and a sort of dance , called ourselves the Pomettes or something like that...and off we went. We shook poms at one game, danced around a bit, then hung up our outfits forevermore. but at least we got our first airplane ride to another place. Hutchinson, oh wow, exotic! This also counted for P.E. credit... I popped in yesterday to see Emily and Flora, Flora took several selfies with my phone and then started scrolling and pushing buttons- pretty sure she may have ordered something from Amazon , clever  child!Where did baby go? This little girl is growing licketty split! She is the smartest person I know. And the most beautiful.I may go over again today- but first I am going to go to a meeting of \"The Daughters of Norway\"...I am not a joiner or a meeting goer, but Dennis thought I might like it because- Norway? His friend's wife will be there to greet me, set up by Dennis. I will go , I am reluctant , I do not like this sort of thing at all! I doubt that they are going to take a plane ride to Hutchinson Kansas any time soon so what is the point?I got up at 4:00 am- I would rather stay home and take a nap or dink around with whatever comes to mind. (grumble)...Time to go, I am going now, I am just about ready, I am nearly out the door....oh wait, I forgot something, Ok, now I am going, just about out the door, leaving now...it is getting late, maybe I should cancel, don't have the number...ok , I will go , now I am going....see you later. I am out, nearly there."},
{"title": "Salley Mavor comes to town, magnificent!", "date": "Friday, March 10, 2023", "text": "Salley Mavor's exhibit, up close, the real deal. The only problem was that they were all framed in glaring glass so photos were difficult,  the clarity of the work probably looks better in glaring glass than non glare. I don't know.  I am sure the choice was made knowing that.Check out Salley's blog/web site/ and especially her film that won awards and was controversial after the orange butthead got elected.  It is brilliant!! As is all of her work and how she does this tiny stitching boggles me mind!! My photos are not doing the work any favors, just giving you an idea , I suppose. If her exhibit is anywhere near your area, do make a point of going to see it. Study it, Marvel at the tiny-ness ,detail, and skill!See how she stitched this magnificent rug?!?a closer look...You can not tell from my terrible attempt to photograph them but they are all 3D, intricate, masterfully stitched, every stitch perfect! Tiny. How???? Looks to be done by magic elves!Ok, I will not insult her work any more with shoddy photos. There are many links to go to to see how she does this incredible art.  DO watch her film, it is so good!! Liberty and Justice. You will recognize all of the characters! I am off now to take a photo of the wasp in the window, it is not very lively, freezing actually, but it is alive and wondering what the hell kind place this is."},
{"title": "taking photos in the quilt museum", "date": "Thursday, March 9, 2023", "text": "Some of the quilts/wall hangings  that made us crawl, clinging to the rail! Feeling dizzy and ill after viewing too  many of these beautifully made quilts of urp up chuck. That is me looking like I am about ready to toss cookies in the gift shop before exiting. I didn't, nor did Stella, but we felt like it.  Stella gets up close to see the tiny stitches and to gather her wits . Up close the works do not seem so whirly. Overall it was just too much!  wall after wall of bright busy zaggy work.SEE what I mean?? This quilt thankfully was broken up by the doorway, it really is a crazy thing and throws you right off balance!The narrow hallway also helps keep the viewer on their feet while looking at the wonky , off putting, piece. If you fall over the wall catches you. Thoughtful placement!These last  ones are safe enough,  a close up of the tiny stitching in a quilt made in the 1800's. The florals and soft colors were a welcome reprieve ! Vintage warmth of  hand stitched comfort, familiarity, nothing glaring back at you, felt nurturing.We had to linger on the porch outside for a bit to get over the dizziness.Snow drops in the garden.I will post photos of Salley Mavor's work in another post . Too many photos for this one. Besides I would not put Salley's work on the same page as the up chuck quilts or the vintage quilts. Salley is in a league of her own!ahhhh, that's better.....that's a quilt I could wrap around myself , feel the love  - a wellness quilt burrito, a sort of back to the womb-Mama- loves -you feel.Morning from the kitchen window , sunshine on  Canadian rocks.A beautiful day to go out with our Stella.We went south to LaConnor to the quilt museum to see Salley Mavor's exhibit and to have a day out in the sunshine. I also left some old wall sconces at the antique light shop for his to do whatever with. They were removed from Dennis's office long ago to make room for better lighting in that old \"office\"  house built in the late 1800's. Great, that is one box of stuff gone. The quilt museum is stunning, Three floors of fabulous quilts, needlework , old charm the interior of the house has been taken back to original gorgeous wood, no painting on the sills or moldings.View ,from upstairs , of LaConnor and the slough.The kitchen and dining.The exhibit was mind blowing- Top floor, Salley's work.The middle floor, the work of a skilled artist that put geometry to work in fabric creating designs that are astonishing. I did not get the artist's name because , Stella and I both, affected so much so that we had to get out of that exhibit. The patterns and bright colors sent us both into vertigo land as we tottered out of there, dizzy and nauseous  and down the stairs feeling unwell.  Odd how patterns and color can send you into a spin.The gift shop is wonderful in itself, I bought a length of black watch green wool that I had to have for the color and the wooliness of it. Anyway, I will post some photos tomorrow of the exhibits. In the meantime go see Salley's work, she is also on my blogroll. tiny stitches, perfect every one!We ended our day in rain, went to the coop for lunch. Everything has changed since damned covid - the deli no longer serves hot meals, I ate a cold burrito, it was delish and I do not mind cold burritos, Stella warmed hers in the one tiny micro wave at the end of what used to be the salad bar.We had ice cream- couldn't resist- fresh strawberry with balsamic- Stella had a massive scoop of salted caramel coffee.  across the street is one of our favorite antique shops, we did go in and I did buy... things- One box out and one box in...that is how I do.  On we went into the weather and home again jiggetty jig. Days out with Stella are always the best!here comes the dark."},
{"title": "how to buy an apple, old photos and a miracle", "date": "Monday, March 6, 2023", "text": "There are two ways to shop for apples-  go to the Coop, buy local organic and choose carefully which apple to bring home - sort of an adoption process. Bring it home and set it on something pretty until  ready to eat. Appreciate it's beauty, its fragrance, its shape,  and the little imperfections that say \"I grew on a tree in an orchard with butterflies, fairies,fancy worms and magical beings .\"Not waxed or altered in a any way, just a beautiful apple. Dennis's way is to go to Cosco and for the price of one magnificent Co-op apple he can buy eight industrial apples in a box with a warning on the side. He can not  eat apples so I know that he had me in mind when he bought them, which is thoughtful....or is it. Benefit of the doubt...yes, thoughtful. some folks just do not appreciate or bother with the aesthetics of buying an apple. This morning I went through a photo album that is returning to dust- found it under the bench holding the ficus, a few photos in it from long ago just barely hanging on.  We were 18  years old, going to college in Northern Wyoming- we drank beer and took photos. We participated in children's theater for fun, not much else on offer.I was Toto the dog in our little production of the Wizard of Ox. I made a fine dog. Surprisingly had many lines that dog's do not usually have because I was the go between, sitting on stage  explaining and setting up the next scene, to bewildered children.In another play I was the child being pushed into show biz by my mother, Trudy. There were five of we girls that went everywhere with one another, did everything together and no one had a real boyfriend.  Boyfriends ruined the mix.We did theater, we drank beer, we smoked camel straights, we ran all over the dirt of Wyoming and sometimes we had sleep overs at Trudy's Mother's house, A tiny place with built in beds like the old country.  Best of times.Here are four of us lined up on the stairs. Trudy at the top.  We did a  bunch of plays and were usually lit  while doing so. The amount of beer consumption was great! Trudy was awesome- I sort of worshiped her if you want to know! She had it all going on!We  graduated and went hither thither. I  went to California  one day, and found Trudy in Santa Barbara  with her new husband, We had dinner and I thought they were without doubt the coolest people ever born.Their friends were coming over with their Wok to make a curry- How exotic! How worldly! How non- hamburger! Her husband was also a musician and a poet, he wrote me a poem...I went back to the ranch where I was living/working and they went, I  know not  where. We lost touch entirely. Life happened and you know how that goes.So I was thinking about Trudy and wondering , after all this time, over fifty years, where she ended up, if she was still alive even. I googled, came up with zip...Well, then, I guess she is lost...I continued to search not willing to accept, an address came up, a phone number came up- I called but it had been discontinued, the google images only showed women with the same name in obituaries. One address was particularity interesting- Bellingham. That can not be ...I could not find the owners of the property  or an email, so I got in my dykemobile and tootled on over to the house, knocked on the door, a very suspicious person came up to the door window and asked what I wanted. I said \" I am looking for , her name, from Ralston Wyoming\", I said who I was, my old name. and she said \"just a minute\"... Calmed her dog and let me in! My TRUDY! It was She! And her husband was there and they are still cool! OMG!Holy shit, what a thing! We talked for way too long and got on just fine and she is still the most splendid  human in the universe and has been in this same town as I , for seventeen years!She has worked (managed) the whole food organic  bakery that we have frequented faithfully for years1 I never saw her. I am gobsmacked utterly. Anyway, we sort of caught up  but to cram fifty plus years into three hours is a reader's digest version of an entire  lifetime...Still reeling.At home now, fed my one legged gull, Peg. ate some corn chips because you know, just not fat enough...and looked out at the sky and the sweet mysteries of life!  I marvel! Small big little crazy world! What are the chances? The odds? WOW. Crumbling photos lead the way, I should say! And there you have it."},
{"title": "Ragfinery shopping, Rosa the dog and orphans celebrate Fresca", "date": "Sunday, March 5, 2023", "text": "I went back to Ragfinery yesterday to get two things specifically - they were still there! One was this tiny brazier for teeny tiny boobage, vintage nylon likely from the fifties. Never sure what to do with things like this , just know that -too hard to pass up because of its construction and cute-ness factor. Howard Hughes had to construct a bra for Jane Russell and used bridge building skills to do so. That created a whole industry for in your face , proud , don't mess with me, tits. This little brazier , however , missed that memo and remains shy and humble with the simplest hook in back, so easy to slip into the undone position. Remember those days? Of course you do not because you were not even born yet. This  tiny embroidered lace is at the hem of a christening slip. In exceptional condition- just a couple of bucks. Finally I went in  to buy  these harem trousers because - color! Screaming blue silk  that I am sure to use for (?) something. When I get one or both machines back I will sew again, I promise myself. I have  loved sewing and creating with fabric in the past and since my eyesight is compromised , hand sewing leaves much to be desired. My stitches are  hen scratches , less tidy even , than stitching up the wounded in the battlefield - hurry- under fire!  Pretty lame.I made a poncho for one of the orphans- the other thought it \"terrific\".Erik texted that he had gone back to the old house to puppysit Rosa while the household went to Vegas for a birthday celebration. Erik chose not to go, pretty much over that sort of \"fun\". So Rosa got to have Erik all to herself and  Erik is glad to have moved into his own apartment, leaving the chaos of life with four others behind. Erik is more tidy/particular/organized. As you can see, it would not take much.I cropped Rosa out of the chaos- black and whited her- she looks saintly . All praise Rosa! Her people and the other pup will be home today - Erik  can get back to his controlled environment and Rosa can get back to being babied by everyone who adores her. Today is also Fresca's birthday and the day of her party. She is vacationing from  blogworld at the moment, for  mental health and creative urges but is  still on IG.I sent some photos of the orphans and friends celebrating Fresca on her 62nd Birthday.The orphans had cake and a can of whipped cream that went sideways...not realizing that it had to be pointed upside down to prevent the cream from shooting out into space. So, let's all raise a glass to our Fresca, a splendid birthday and many more with a pinch to grow and inch. It has been inspiring getting to know her.PAR-TAY!!!!"},
{"title": "That insane trumpian woman, avisit to Ragfinery, old sew and sew", "date": "Friday, March 3, 2023", "text": "Today I felt 100 percent and did a whole bunch of running around- Of course I had to hit the Assistance league where this dolly stands at attention, she has been there for a couple of weeks which is unusual . the turn around at the AL is quick. But now I understand why this dolly has not gone home with someone, and why she gives me the willies....  You be the judge! From there I went to Ragfinery , a  small warehouse affair with the most amazing assortment of all things fabric. They are on IG if you are curious. Going in there is like walking into a dream of possibilities and temptations. Everything so affordable you can not possibly walk out without buying something .I took Millie along because it was raining and she has the gear for it- she met a friend . her friend is a mish -mash of different dolls who have been injured and reassembled as one.  Repurposing.I wanted to buy a whole bunch of stuff, So much of it  is so excellent even it you don't sew the quality of the \"rags\" is so fine! I slapped my hand away  several times and only came away with two pieces of oil cloth for a dollar-fiddy total, no tax. The orphans wanted to test it to see if they could get oily walking on it. They did not. \"Disappointing,\" they agreed.I finally took both sewing machines in to Social Fabrics,  Miss Molly- for servicing or for scrapping, not sure which. Both of them weigh a ton and damned if I did not manage to carry both at the same time from the back lot around the building and up the stairs and down to the shop, without killing myself! I have great upper body strength , my legs are wimpy. I bought a recumbent stationary bike...it was delivered yesterday and is waiting for me to put it together. First I have to shift things and make sensible room for it and then I am off to the races. No excuses, like -I can't go out today- too cold, too wet. too snowy, too hot, too dark, too whatever the hell cry baby thing I can come up with.Must get in some decent form for my trip, and for the rest of my days on this planet of gravity,   for a long walk around London for the last hurrah, probably.  Thinking about it all the time.Stella will be leaving soon-ish for Finland . Getting our travel jollies before we are unable.  Ain't nobody getting any younger. Today is as young as I will ever be! Strangely , that does not suck, I am loving this age."},
{"title": "car dealership cooking, curious fawn and a bug", "date": "Tuesday, February 28, 2023", "text": "First thing in the morning I went to the car dealer to get a new battery. I barely made it across town with the  jump. Greeted in the waiting area by  massive television screen blaring  heavy metal cranky blurty  guitar  riffs while show casing  manly men in Carharts and leather, backwards ball caps, cooking with blow torches, chainsaws, hatchets, manly implements. I learned some things. You can add vinegar to mayonnaise and call it white sauce, you can clear a field, truck in tons of hay, light it on fire and roast enough chickens to feed a few thousand \"hangry\" folks. You can build a log house looking thing, make sure every log in the county is used, and make sure it is large enough to fill a parking lot, torch it, and wait for the embers. Load up an entire steer sawed in half  toss it on the embers with a dash of salt. That's dinner folks!    I did fall in love with this 60's vehicle and offered to buy it for that 60's price, but they said \"NO Ma'am.\"  OK then, I will just take my battery and go. Battery still on warranty which was a nice surprise , instead of spending $250.00 I spent zero, just my precious time.  Afternoon we decided to go to the theater to see \"Living\" , sweet little film , Bill Nighy, Britain after the war. Typically British in the good sense, everyone polite and caring for the most part except for the stinker working head desk at public services. He is a pickle! UNTIL....The acting is flawless, the characters relatable, and Bill Nighy is wonderful as always. He looks like a character Erik would use in animation, severe slash for a mouth, crippled hands, upright ,so much so that bending is probably never an option. His trousers never need pressing.Halfway through the film I started feeling less well. I hung on thinking that I only need to use the loo and all would be better. I did do that-  a  bit better, then off to the grocery to get cat food. While talking to the man in front of us I felt off , like my head was circling the man buying the hershey bar and my hair was lifting him up to reach the cash register because he was only three inches tall,  the minute we got home I went to bed. If you google salmonella it tells you basics, like no big deal you may vomit, have diarrhea, a fever, cramps- sounds do-able.  If you have ever had a period you are well versed  and can handle it.What they leave out are descriptive adjectives and, that when everything gooshy in your body  realizes there is a bug they all get the hell out of there fast and at the same time! It is violent and you will upchuck all the way back to last thanksgiving! Everything that erupts , for hours, is a  trump orange color due to the bacteria's preference for \"vile things.\" Your face will become a red marshmallow from all of the pressure exerted and your head will pop.  You are WAY sick, no fooling. This went on all night, by morning it was just massive orange diarrhea, having run out of orange vomit, every ten minutes or so- and a headache that pounds like the Manly Man's guitar on the highway to hell . Too bad, you can not take a head ache pill, your devastated system will not allow. You are wiped out and stay in bed all night all day and all the next day, slowly rising on the forth day to shake it off ,  unable to lift a kitten, so weak.On the mend. Two bananas, a hand full of grapes, and a cup of tomato soup just now, days later...feeling almost normal. And water, buckets of water!The bacteria can stay with a person for a few days  or  a few years...it only takes 100 hundred of those cells , which can fit comfortably on the tip of a ballpoint pen, to destroy you.This is the fluffy fawn looking in through the bedroom window offering comfort, or is that judgement, hard to tell. Bottom line is this: Do not leave your chicken soup on the counter too long, forget about it and stick it in the fridge. Do not eat that soup unless you have boiled the bejesus out of it. I reckon I am off of chicken soup for the rest of the year.  Now there is snow falling and it is very lovely. I am going to live to rue another day! Cheers y'all- stay alive. I am off to take a nap after my nap."},

So large I had to stop a couple of people on the walkway to make sure that they noticed. We stood and marveled, had a nice chat, we are neighbors, we do not approve of the crazy high tech parking meters newly  installed in Fairhaven. We cursed the genius  who stuck those weirdo things in there and the board who allowed it. They are dumb. So rare is a sky like this that is is like a wonder of the world. I want to roll it up and wear it around my neck, or a bracelet. Silver energizes.It started to get darker as I approached home but still - there it was- a bit of blue! The storm must have changed direction. We still do not have the promised snow and wind.I passed the dog pub, music blaring, no pups in the yard at this time. There are a few wonderful things about this town, this is one.A place and yard for dogs to play while humans down a pint and a nibble. Dogs must be vaccinated, must be docile , humans must be responsible. No mayham in the Ham!This is the first day of LENT. I observed Lent when I was a child and I was so very faithful! A promise to my best friend,  Dead  magic Jesus...I kept my promises though it may have been difficult at times. I stuck to it. My family just gave me a lot of  eye roll and side eye and a few exasperated tsks. They allowed me to go through my little girl fantasy, wearing white lace gloves, a straw hat, pink fluffy dress,to walk to the prettiest church in town , to talk to my invisible friend. It was a game. The question was asked, \"What will you give up for Lent?\" A commitment was made- and I did not eat chocolate until Easter. Quite a challenge in a house full of chocolate, Bowls of it all around the house and in  cupboards, I was eight years old, chocolate was  my breakfast!Will power for a godly reason carries a lot of oomph. Especially as a child believing  that belief. Fairies , also real, Santa , of course! And the curse of stepping on a crack! Maturity and a look into a science book has been helpful to drag me out of my childish beliefs- I just wish I had some measure of solid resolve to Lent something for the good of all- Now I am too much of a  hedonist to  wear the hair shirt,  to give up a loved thing for an invisible dead guy on a stick. I do miss the songs..."},

I put finger puppets in the monkey bowl, and entire set of Old MacDonald's farm. Flora may be amused, she may not. Never know.A very old beat up well used Mexican child's chair. Sturdy and hunky. Usually they have rush seats but this one is wooden. Could be that the rush fell apart and was replaced with wood.This chair is larger than ones I have had in the past. Maybe for a larger baby/kid.It will certainly suit some bears that are roaming through the house . I did look in the doll bin  at the store and found a pilot bear which I put in the basement airport. Dennis has not noticed it yet and may not. He is mostly concentrating on flying through the county.Rarely do I see a good toast rack. this one will do, especially since it cost next to nothing. Only problem is that one little silver foot is missing, so the toast might fall over.I am thinking it might be well used as a cage for something wild or a cage for some sort of tiny taxidermy.Finally  in my world of hunting and gathering,  polka dot tray, Portugal, love the glaze and the semi raised dots.

The luckiest deal was that Delta had two first class seats, non refundable , layover in LAX for three and a half hours, for less than comfort or premium by two thousand dollars.  I hit the \"buy\" button thinking this can not be true, yet it was true so YAHOO! Also  found a tiny flat in Dulwich on Northcross road, which is a laid back , out of the city, neighborhood. This will be a different sort of stay in London.

I will be there for nearly 5 months, through all of the winter holidays coming home mid January if the weather permits and if the plane does not blow up. Do I feel guilty for being gone for so long? Not at all, I just hope that all remains even keeled without my ballast. Speaking of...I must shed about a hundred pounds before September rolls around. My phone's facial recognition does not even recognize me anymore. Off to a great start- breakfast this morning - crumpets with cream cheese and marmalade! I am so committed to weight loss, right?Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life ... Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. (Steve Jobs)"},
{"title": "art day in the Ham", "date": "Sunday, February 19, 2023", "text": "By appointment only, in the oldest brick building in Washington state, built during the gold rush , used for court house, jail, taxidermy- now a renovated museum to house the art of Helen Loggie. The little building has long been a favorite little gem, in the \"sketchy \" part of town, I am amazed that is still remains upright.Most of the window glass is also original , all wavy and irregular. The floors are stunning old growth cedar. Hefty beams. Because Washington is a relatively new state it is unusual to have buildings from mid 1800's  hanging around. This one was built initially to sort out gold rush business but , because gold rushers were supposed to register in Victoria, they had to up root their houses and cart them to B.C. No grand houses left behind, just this little brick building.  Helen was born in 1898 to a wealthy timber baron family, in Bellingham.They owned property here and on Orcas Is.After she came back from studying art in Europe , she decided to settle here and focus on her true loves, Trees/art/etching/. She is-has been- the star artist of the San Juans. I walked past her house every day on my way to work, she was still living then and shouting at children who would ride their bikes over the very large roots of her trees.She never married, her wealth never ran out, she lived to be nearly one hundred. a blessed life of privilege and passion.Her technique is most curious. She never used \"shading\", rather,  used varied thickness of pen or pencil to achieve depth and texture. some drawings took well over a year to complete. having finally completed a perfect drawing would then etch - wax on copper- every line redrawn precisely.  magnifying glass and stylus used by Helen. She had done a fair amount of oil painting as well. Below is one  of Mud Bay in Chuckanut village where I lived in a cabin after having moved off of the boat in the harbor. This view is so familiar to me I nearly passed right by the painting.There is more art in the basement, bars still on windows from when the jailed hooligans of the day lost their freedom. There is a small kitchen as well, but primarily it is an archive of all of the Bellingham news papers , some got flooded and were rescued by diligent historians. It took a few years to dry them out, flatten them and put them in large file holders. The collection is massive and fragile.A large printer from the very old Herald days , in a corner for inspection and wonder.So, that was Thursday in the town. On Friday Stella and I went to lunch , sorted out the world. She has a new hobby. In the evening ,with nothing better to do, she will follow  threads of \"discussion\" online. You know how that goes- people get stupid in a hurry. Stella leaves one comment - \"shut up\" - and then leaves the thread. Still laughing  days later, hilarious Stella!She is on her way this summer to Finland, her mother land , for three weeks, never long enough but she has a little dog and not enough cash to stay longer. I think she should move there, she could as she is all the way back into the beginning of time- Finnish.  It is where she belongs.Leaving the museum. My car parked behind the Light House Mission, which was for years the only roof and soup that bums could take advantage of. The rules were strict serving up  a lot of GOD talk along with the soup, the facility shoddy, it finally closed a couple of years ago. No longer an option. And here is a posy at the entrance of the place where Stella and I enjoyed a three hour lunch.  Snow is coming next week, surprising buds again.Seeing art in the ham....and before you get mad at me for being insensitive:\"A hobo is a migrant worker in the United States. Hoboes, tramps and bums are generally regarded as related, but distinct: a hobo travels and is willing to work; a tramp travels, but avoids work if possible; and a bum neither travels nor works.\""},

I obeyed the sign and walked slowly, down through the neighborhood and to the path leading to town. Meandered through town a bit, bought a baby present for our neighbors expecting a grand baby in the next ten minutes. He is a fisherman so I got a fish teether and a hand crochet starfish. There were so many things in the shop that caught my eye.  Kits for making tiny houses and tiny rooms, with chocolate eclairs on the counter. So adorable. I mentioned them to the clerk and she rolled her eyes and sighed. \"Yes, they are adorable- but try putting them together! SO frustrating- when  finally  done, you feel empty,  you have lost all  meaning in life, all encompassing project that owned your soul, and  you wonder WTF?\" I won't be buying that  any time soon. Thanks for the review... I walked to Taylor's  dock, The wind, cold and biting, gave me hives.There is a bench in the sun that I have not seen before, I would have liked this guy, and so would you, I guess....Boats anchored close to one another bouncing around, facing into the wind. No one going out for a sail today, thank you!I walked back into town, saw a tiny shop that I had not seen before, Nice guy , just opened during covid so has had a hard time getting going. He was in the process of cleaning chandelier glass. His aesthetic is dead animals, moldy worn dirty things , calls them antiques. Right up my alley, I could not afford the bear head but did buy a mink skull to keep company with the other bony heads on the piano. From there I walked along the bay to watch the ducks freeze.Through the woods , up the hill, and back into the neighborhood.I thought that I had not even walked one mile but turns out it was three plus. Shoes , not the best so it is back to my ridiculous looking HOKA  shoes that I wore last time walking all over London. Never a problem with them but they are highly unattractive- monsterish and weird with  boat shaped roly souls. It is not about \"Looks\" though is it.  There is a lot of freedom that comes with old age! I am loving the Honey badger attitude I seem to have acquired.Favorite narrator!Both places in London that I was considering are no longer available.  Pity...I have not booked a flight yet either. Maybe it is that magic thing that happens sometimes, spoiling things because there is some major trauma coming and you must stay close to home to save everyone, because - life is like that when you  adult. OR maybe it is that a more perfect place will show up , cheaper and cuter? Yeah, maybe that."},

Two nights ago he , with bat in hand, had to talk down a tweeker at the back door wanting his \"bag of weed that Pete had stolen\"...No Pete, no weed - it was intense- such a bad neighborhood. Erik's skills put the fire out and the guy went away. Then last night he had to climb over \"CRIME\" tapes to get into their house as a guy was murdered a few steps from where the kids live. Anyway, He has completed his move today and we can all sigh with relief. Although I am concerned for his housemates  and their pets. It is not safe. Portland sucks! I watched our baby girl for a couple of hours on Friday, Delight!  Never enough time spent with her. Growing SO DAMNED FAST!!!I found the glass heart in a drawer, and it fit so perfectly in the deer vertebrae- nestled right in like it belonged. Valentine for the top of the piano. Polar  jet lag bear with orphan- Bear borrowed  clothing from someone else around here and looks mighty spiffy we all agree.  I made jet lag bear when I came back from London in 2019 . No pattern- no machine just cut out bits  that looked bear-ish from an old cardigan , stitched them together maniacally  and then went to bed for a week...The bear had been born!I am having difficulty booking a flight online, keep getting the boot , and can not secure a place to stay until I have dates. I called triple A , which I have used successfully in the past but due to covid they have closed their office here and are just booking cruises and package resort  deals .  Tomorrow I will hunt down an agent and  get them to do the work for a fee. September seems a long time from now but you just know it will be here liketty split. I have a couple of places in mind one specifically and especially -  Chiswick. Outside of the city center about 20 minutes by tube.  Pricey but I am reckoning this is my last hurrah so- fug it. Take all  my money!  The other place is in Paddington, right in the heart of all things London. In a house with a man and a dog. The dog is the main draw.  Anyway Chiswick is charming, right on the river and close to Kew Gardens where I would love to spend all of my days!   -0- Sunset, on my way home from Flora's house, just barely squeaking through.  More rain, and more rain.

Pink is always first it seems. Orphans wanted to go to the little library on the street- they had  a book in mind something like \" All of the candy for a penny\"... that book does not exist.  There are no library books with candy in them,  disappointing. There was a tiny painting which was nice, and a string of light up hearts, which made the library not a total loss. You can see by the donated books what sort of neighborhood we live in....Down the street gnomes were playing \"Chest\". Orphans helped them both to win. They have their own rules. Everyone is a winner and no one dies.The other gnome who is a very old man, still trying to get his wheel barrow across the grass- been doing it for years...had to stop the orphans for a quick conversation  about the admirable qualities of Sisyphus and how strong he must have been. The orphans did agree.The man on the little tractor thing gave the girls a ride. He then said that they were adorable and they said back to him- \"No  YOU are!!!\" Riding the no- pooping- dog that is tethered to my friends  berm. It is an old dog - the ride was not as fast as one would like. A glove was found, Maple tried it on , determined it was more of a sleeping bag than a glove, which she did not need. It was left behind for maybe a mouse or a squirrel to use. Mail boxes are endless fun, Lots of sliding. Lots of climbing and hiding. They must have spent at least 7 seconds on this one alone! Then they found the  fence post with the wonky mirror. They asked me to take it home with me so that they could have it always.  \"No\" I said ,\"It belongs to the owner\". We will just have to walk to the fence post more often.They walked on without the mirror, without the glove, but found a fancy stick to bring along. This is the stick of \"because I said so.\" They claim it has mighty  powers. I did agree that it has  deportment and authority. Orphans looked amused/satisfied as they generally do.  I have not walked for so long I have forgotten how to put one foot in front of the other- and sort of stumble lurch  and trip forward. It is shameful- I must get out and use these things. legs? Yeah, legs. and the paddle things, feet? I think they are. I managed to find my walking shoes though, that is a plus. Tomorrow is another day , I must get out and walk. If it is not raining tomorrow I will walk far- memory will return and I will cease looking like the ministry of silly walks.  I have made that promise to myself."},

It meant more to me than to the school so...I love this book- it makes French language easier than any other book I have found- elementary to be sure! And if you have been staying awake at night, singing Fais Ton Dodo , wondering about the translation , here you go.  Also I loved this book when I was fourteen- like a ticket out of town and someday Maybe I would actually go to France. Several trips to and through France, when I could be the boss of myself, determined that I do not really like France. But I still love this book. The flowers died very quickly, only a week old. Petals everywhere and one dried blossom, I scooped them up and put them in the bowl on the table while I washed out the vase. Accidental coolness. On my way home from Flora's house I stopped in at the Assistance League with purpose in mind. Looking for yardage to make a thing. There was this viking bowl for two dollars!  Yes please, I will have that- beside it, is the only thing I brought back from Norway- a stone from the shore. Flora likes phones and cameras. This is her selfie .This is her second selfie. The kid's got skills! Much of the day spent figuring out the diaper business for dolly.Head wrap, yes...arm wrap, yes. Dust cloth, yes. Diaper on baby's butt , nope. She talks to her babies and says GA GA GA GA- she also says \" I ya ooo\" Which is \"I Love YOU\"-her vocabulary really is growing and blows me away when she says something clearly , knowingly, like she is teaching me. I now know \"car, tree, hat, Papa, owl, apple\" - pretty soon I may be speaking English  fluently.I take a bag full of toys when I go over, pack them back home after Flora has had the entertainment of emptying the bag. Electronic toy is just OK, not fabulous. Flora would rather have human interaction and that is how it should be! Her imagination is superb.I was doing something with my back turned for one second and I heard Baby girl saying \"yum umyumm\" - I had half of a chocolate chip cookie in my purse,  in the double zipped pocket! Miss Flora sussed that out licketty split.  Man, she is fast and clever. I convinced her that  cookie was not a good idea and gave her nut butter on seed bread instead. Agreeable little pixie! What am I doing with half a chocolate chip cookie in my bag? I went to a friend's house for lunch , she baked them and fed me so well in her new slick- trendy- gorgeous-  television- worthy kitchen. I have not seen her for many many years , we drifted apart as people do. Pretty amazing to re-unite over lunch and art, Her house is a gallery! It is the most perfect place I have ever been, I think, besides all of those other perfect places that are not my house! I just can't seem to help myself- two more sawdust Polish dolls arrived in the mail. Think I can stop now- twenty is enough ? My friend's house has a theme, an aesthetic of good taste , complimentary colors , light , soothing , artsy and  interesting.

I may remove the bow tie and just have him be wild and naked, I prefer naked & wild.Under the bed I found a box of paper mache , made in Germany, walnuts, pine cones and balls. Previously I felted bug families and put them in the nuts. I had forgotten that I still had some.Unsuccessfully I tried a tiny paper house with moss and stars, E6000 glue, a few berries,  nestled in the nut. I don't especially like this idea and will move on to some other failed idea soon. Playing around, I will come up with something eventually. The outside of the nut is better if painted. plain mache grey is kind of cool but looks too much like a dust ball.Anyway, that is how I wasted time yesterday afternoon. Spoke with the lad as he walked to his friend's house to deliver a birthday present to \"them\". \"How many people  are having a birthday\", I asked. You would think that I would be used to hearing that pronoun and stop thinking of \"they\" as plural. Old person hurdle to get over, fighting change is predictable with old futs. While listening to the city council meeting, as people introduced themselves , having announced  their names they automatically clarified which pronoun they identified with. It's a new day!

BUT frozen seafood just does not do it for us so I cancelled our next order and closed the book on that company.  There is nothing like fresh caught wild seafood right off of the hook- we are spoiled that way.Dennis had a boat that he bought from a friend as the friend's wife took me out to watch the horses eat carrots- pretty sure she did not want me to voice my opinion . She hated that boat and wanted to get rid of it quick. Anyway , Dennis bought the boat , a glass ply stinker. We took it out a few times and usually caught Ling Cod off of Patos island.We anchored in Inati bay where shelter was good. When this photo was taken, we had not caught anything and resorted to potatoes for dinner. Anyway that boat was a POS. Lingered in the driveway for years - a tree grew out of it - the children used it for a club house. Finally , not that long ago, someone took it and the trailer for free- who knows what became of it. Point being - fresh caught wild cod/salmon whatever is just hard to beat even though the fish company from Alaska tries to keep  their fish as fresh as possible, it just is not...Plus it is very expensive. Not as expensive as buying a shite boat , however, but our boat fishing, clubbing ling cod until they are no longer thrashing days are over. Sad, not sad..."},

He was sculpted by house builder Steve Badanes -- who had never made a statue before -- two of his University of Washington architecture students, Will Martin and Ross Whitehead, and his then-girlfriend Donna Walter. Badanes's design for head-and-shoulders sculpture won a contest sponsored by the Fremont Arts Council. The shaggy troll, 18 feet tall, glares southward with his shiny metal eye -- a Volkswagen Beetle hubcap. In his left hand he crushes the rest of the old-style Beetle, which originally contained a time capsule of Elvis memorabilia; it was removed after the car was vandalized and the California license plate was stolen (The crushed car and out-of-state plate were meant as protests against \"outsider\" development). There are plenty of places to pose, and interaction with the troll is encouraged as long as you're respectful.  (photo by Soxygal) The community pays tribute to the troll every October 31st with a mobile \"Troll-o-ween\" party, starting under the bridge and wandering to other funky art sites and events in Fremont. Of which there are plenty: Fremont is also home to the largest Lenin statue in the U.S. Every few years something weird happens in the troll's vicinity to bring it back into the news. In 1998, for example, a man shot a bus driver and ran the bus off the Aurora bridge, crashing on top of an apartment building adjacent to the troll -- for a while you could still see evidence of the impact. In late 2013 over a dozen bloody sheep skulls mysteriously appeared in a yard adjacent to the troll, perhaps the remains of its midnight snack. -0-The orphans decided to take our troll out for a breath of fresh air. He can be cranky but for the most part he watches over the orphans. I think he was the third object I felted in my felting life and he looks so much like my Dad that he will stay here being a grumpy caretaker. I got a bit carried away and used a lot of my wool. After this Dad troll I resorted to smaller trolls, easier, quicker - fast sellers at the festival of light fair. Wool went farther for a dollar.-0-Yesterday Flora was busy in her office. All the while taking care of her two kids! She also sorted dinosaurs and read  a few books.She is a gal on the go!I was mistaken about the vanilly baby- Flora already had a small baby that smells the same but even more strongly of vanilla. so, The French Bebe went to stay with its little sister and Flora Jane.  Her children are well behaved but a handful none the less. French bebe has blinky eyes - miraculously and bravely the bebe does not cry or flinch when eyes are examined by prodding poking fingers.  The dinosaurs adorned the  top of waffles. We have had two family parties at the waffle/brewery. I collected the dinosaurs and have plenty. Organizing her office, Flora put them in the jar, took  them out of the jar, stirred them with a toothbrush, dumped them on the dollies, taught them how to say \"shit\". I would say the dinosaurs had a great time. Flora doesn't say much, but she does say \"shit\" very clearly. Endearing. She's our girl!I will be going over again today and on Friday. I hope that Flora can cope with old granny energy. She does not seem to mind - she knows that I am hers one hundred percent and will allow all sorts- like going through my purse with all of the zippers. No worries, I put things in purse that are for her and hide the other stuff behind my back. She knows  but is kept too busy to mind. Rain forced them back inside, where  cranky troll likes to guard the living room.  He moves from room to room and has chosen the living room as his favorite. Rain is NOT his favorite."},

Any answers? I am feeling something that feels like desperation. Maybe I just need to go for a walk in the weather  \"dressed up in leather with a cap under my chin.\" But - ewww- it is so uninviting out there. I actually looked for old lady  health resorts online.  Costa Rica, California, Mexico...Florida! Looking was enough - spiritual, yoga, drinking green slime, eating one almond a day ,meditation, walking a labyrinth -not my cuppa.  GOOP popped up in the search. I have known about  GOOP for years but, really never looked at what Gwyneth  was up to other than the notorious  jade egg.\"Yoni eggs harness the power of energy work, crystal healing, and a Kegel-like physical practice. Insert the egg into your vagina and feel the connection with your body by squeezing and releasing the egg.\"   Fancy that lifestyle? Possibly, if one had  loads of dosh and wanted to jump in that game, similar to a very expensive religion that promises  eternal youth and a oneness with  the  Universal  Hen, one could follow her. Anyway, GOOP is finally losing money and losing the gullible to other  flim flam. There is always something going on that provides \"the answers to  your dreams, your insecurities, your everything\". I will say that there is one GOOP device that looks rather sweet, It is  soft and heart shaped and has  buttons for varying levels of buzzes, Cute...yeah, I'll have that- for how much did you say???  Oh, OK never-mind. In the end, no resort/health spa, no goop life, no walk out there in the shite weather...I will go through some closets and eat the rest of the Christmas biscuits, because I only gained twenty pounds over Christmas.  That will make me glad for twenty minutes I am sure. No telling what I may find- The YMCA disco GI Joes have pretty much made my day."},

Cooper's hawk, a breather", "date": "Friday, January 20, 2023", "text": "CUTE! This morning out of the corner of my eye-  larger than a towhee , more graceful than a crow, with a very direct stare. Coopers hawk on the rail looking at me,   like I might have a mouse in my pocket.  Hawks rarely come to our house.  Such a pleasant surprise to have a new visitor. He watched for a while, interested in what I was doing, it appeared. I had no mouse in my possession, other than computer mouse, not tasty. Dang. He lost interest and flew to a more promising field. I was looking up Homelessness, tramps, hobos and bums.  and came across this excellent site:Hooverville in Seattle.https://depts.washington.edu/depress/index.shtmlhttps://depts.washington.edu/depress/index.shtmlThe difference between homeless today and the homeless of yesterday-  homeless of yesterday tried , at least in Hooverville. They built a functioning community, helping one another, building shacks  out of the cast offs from the \"haves\", from the garbage dump close by. They looked for work, they worked  for a penny or a sock, for anything at all.1930/31 was unkind to just about everyone. The folks in Seattle,  Scandinavian immigrants primarily , tried like hell to make it work, to stay alive, to be productive citizens. Success. However, as seems to be consistent in human existence,  when a group  deemed  as \"the other\"  their efforts become  guaranteed failure. The city burned Hooverville  to the ground....twice. Many of the menfolk worked on the docks , very little pay if at all,  a fishhead , a bowl of soup...maybe an old worn souwester to wear in  Seattle's  relentless  foul weather. They did all of the things to be right and true in this foreign land of opportunity? \"Burn it down! Eyesore! Go away!We want the  pretty, NOT the pretty dirty.\"The homeless situation  is very different these days -mental hospitals non existent, cheaply made drugs  burning holes in brains, ridiculous truck loads of guns/knives/ explosive devices  on the street,  folks trying to stay warm making fires in ally ways , established businesses burning down as a result . Fentanyl cut into  drugs . The homeless population has no where to go and for the most part have mental issues scraping souls  down to splinters.  Reagan and capitalism  saw to that. Republicans - consistent are they not? This is such  old news,so  what's my point.  Point is- IDK- come out from under the covers long enough to see  our sorry  country  and where it is headed, complacency is a trick.  Make a plan for yourself. These past two years have been a sorely needed breather having gasped  through the orange gas, but that is all it is, a breather. Complacency trending.... If you are lucky enough to have a home or relatives with homes, hang on tightly and donate what you can to mental health facilities - (talking to myself here). Circle  wagons , live smaller. Bring the chickens and goats in as well. Huddle.    Preach it Sister!  ------Can a Great Depression happen again?Could a Great Depression happen again? Possibly, but it would take a repeat of the bipartisan and devastatingly foolish policies of the 1920s and ' 30s to bring it about. For the most part, economists now know that the stock market did not cause the 1929 crash.------I think we have the recipe! Yesterday and today the sky miraculously cleared. Light wonderfully  blinded us ! Fabulous, just as I was about to kick the stool.Cheated death again, thank you Mr. Golden Sun!!  Stella and I  went out for lunch, a celebration!Crab melts and salad, I have eaten better  crab melts but there is nothing quite as good as the company of Stella- could eat poop and it  would be just fine, in the company of the gal with the best ideas.  We ran out of fucks to give, we gave them all, like machine gun fire.

If one utters complaint against another on a day like today, it is fodder for Nordic suicide ,depression , divorce, murder, the eating of loaves of bread not out of hunger but comfort.  We ride it  out as always during this time of the year, making a vow to not repeat it next winter, plan a trip outahere.  We promptly  forget that vow as soon as  the sun comes out. We  stay, do it all again, make a vow again, forget, we hold on... Time to  also hold our thoughts close and say nothing. If we have learned anything from previous winters we realize that nothing can be done  but to hold fast quietly.  Say nothing. Make no decisions. Do not follow impulses. Answer the door, offer tea, keep conversations minimal and inconsequential. Winter, like a  mean drunk, can not be held responsible.  It is us. What occurs in the minds and actions of humans during  this paucity/ dearth of light lacking optimism, challenges the bank  of wisdom,compassion and gentility. It is difficult to not take it personally, in your heart you know that it is just the godamn PNW  disagreeable winter. So you say nothing and hope like hell the other person is on board. -0-Cop Watch Portland, bailed Erik out at the city counsel meeting today , All volunteer group of very savvy well spoken people , grassroots, holding the police accountable, speaking truth to their vile lying  slime. The attorney for the police has a voice  on the counsel- reviewing the events she lied again,  and left the counsel members doubting the night of horror,  UNTIL, to the rescue The man from Cop Watch spoke to the counsel, reiterated the events as they really happened, reiterated the lies from police and scolded the city for not holding cops accountable, for not training them better, for not adhering to law...And then he showed them the video of the assault- no question!!! The attorney for the police minimized Erik's injuries , said he hurt his knee, fall down go boom ....Oh man, caught her in her web of evil right there.  The Cop Watcher then listed the injuries, the trauma, the bogus charges and lies and told the counsel that they need to do better- to be better and to hold bad policing accountable especially a specific officer who has a stack of complaints of brutality against him. He is the one who got promoted and praised by the force. I do not know the sum of  the settlement, it is not much and probably less than they claimed it would be , but it is over and ended in a spectacular way with Cop Watch, on record, exposing the city and the police for the shite that they are. Not an entirely dismal day, there is always something that shines through, well not ALWAYS- no such thing as \"always\", is there. We live in change, movement, that is our home our universe- just stfu during the darkness of winter. Memory is a problem to being Zen-like, even when spring bursts hearts wide open,  memory has had time to root. Meanwhile....carry on. And keep it to yourself unless it is to save a  life. That is the one exception. Gin is nice....this just in if you want to read the entire thing about the \"incident\".

Not sure what is coming up here, I think Dennis planted milkweed  for flying insects, or some kind of wild flowers. When he is not fat shaming the nation (including his wife) he is rather productive and caring .

The homeless situation is draining the city as well. So, that's it pretty much. Portland has taken a severe dive into apocalyptic Anarchy.  Anyway, it is over , moving on,  though a bit broken  in spirit and in body having been the target of police brutality/ racism/nazi amerika. Rude awakening to say the least, however, all of this bullshit has not  put justice on the back burner entirely. There is still some fire and fight left in the lad.

This is OUR weather- this morning it was 60 degrees, overcast , the rain came but not furiously. Dark , of course. but the bay looks so lovely in its soft stripes and moodiness. Aren't the colors delicious? I went to AL , knowing that I may come home with an object or two...Yes indeed, rarely disappointed. A matte pottery vase probably from the forties, and a section of  branch, hand carved into three joining sections ( bowls), Beauty! On the way home had to stop and get fresh flowers for the new old vase. Organic wild  free range chickens were on sale, if you can even believe that! Was the grocery doing us a solid or just trying to get rid of diseased bird flu  chooks? Dunno but one is roasting in the oven right now. I have spent way too many hours looking at places in London and near by - have decided that AirB&B is  scamming, they have become way too  greedy, as seems to happen with all things . Their fees are crazy, plus if I want a chunk of time the  places I would consider  are already semi booked for autumn. VRBO is just flat out ridiculous. So, this is what I will do- stay a week here and a week there in affordable hotels. which will give me varied neighborhoods to wander. I will not have to book so far in advance either. Plus moving around will keep my pack light. I will only come back with photos. (right)At AL, I bought a pet for the orphans. They have been jealous that one of their sisters went to live in the Gator infested waters of Florida. This is perfect.In the post yesterday  from  orphan godmother Fresca, came some jolly sheet music , Maple ,   having never seen sheet music before  was pretty sure that someone had flattened little round bugs in tidy rows. \"Clever\", she thought, as she went out to find some to flatten.  So another day another dollar at AL. The skies are back to Pacific northwest  soggy flannel. Cara Cara oranges are abundant in the market now, like dessert- so sweet and juicy- gator approved.  All is well and cheap hotels are the answer! Keep your powder dry!By the way, Jack Ryan on amazon prime is a good watch. Binging on that dude! Staying up way too late but , you know how it goes. binge worthy series are one delight that we can get away with, being grown ups and all....No body tells us \"time to go to bed\" , or \"turn that damned thing off!\" John Krasinski is soooo good, as is Wendell Pierce.

This 4:20 is AM, not a time for anyone to be up except murderers, stoners, and new mothers. I ordered this Timex because I had lost my other watch  , though super cheap,  this one has bigger everything, My eyes appreciate the enormous face and the military time as well as a light up in the night feature. My other watch was not really lost, just misplaced, but I am glad because  el cheapo Timex  is everything a visually impaired gal could hope for! My eyes at 4:20 am, could not determine if my cuppa was full enough...it was. (not shadow- that is coffee) I thought that maybe I had enough uninterrupted time to replant all of the sprouts on the sill, but then realized that the potting soil was outside in the rain and  temperature below chill and the little clay pots were in the mystery garage somewhere.  Onward to another thing to do in the dark.Early in the afternoon, while running errands, hunting and gathering, I went to the thrift store which I said I would boycott just on principle- looking for , um, what was it that I was looking for???I forget- but this is what I came away with, who could resist? Plus it was senior discount day- bonus. I bought the larger baby doll for Flora, as she is now in the mood for baby dolls with blinky eyes. The little cloth doll is a Waldorf doll with hand knit cable sweater, clean as a whistle, never played with. The little black dolly has stuffing coming out of legs and head. She  is a darling and well worth saving.So, at 4:20 am, I sat with this baby doll on my lap , looking it up online especially since a woman as I left the shop said,\" That is a very nice doll- I collect dolls, rather USED to, I had to get rid of 400 , only kept 200 as I have moved into a condo, It broke my heart.\" (only kept 200!!!) This baby doll was made in France. Les Plumini, 1999, a company that prides itself on not using phthalates , cadmium or other harmful substances. The doll is cloth bodied and cuddly, wears French diapers and had a french onesie that had seen better days. I bought it a new outfit for a dollar. Sitting on my lap, in the dark quiet , I felt  a 4:20 a.m. peace.  I began to wonder if I was experiencing contact munchies- kept smelling cookies , vanilla cookies, getting hungrier by the minute, got up to rummage through the kitchen, put the dolly on the chair. The farther I got from dolly the  more the cookie smell waned...I could not find this doll online anywhere, just  newly made ones, though  did find an obscure description. \"Doll smells of  soft vanilla, a comfort  for your child\"....Well, that puts the kibosh on giving this baby to our baby! Emily is allergic to fragrances, all sorts, Plus I am realizing now that everywhere this dolly is,  a strong vanilla scent lingers. It is kind of icky , like the feeling you get having consumed way too much buttercream icing on top of fudge on top of a peanut butter toffee chocolate chip brownie- you know that feeling...It is a wonderful doll , just right for cuddling  and in perfect condition. However if 24 years of being in the wild has not weakened the vanilla  cookie smell , nothing will. Dolly is cursed. Poor thing. It is too cute and forlorn to give back to V.V. so I will just let it rest here until I get a taker. Could be a family of covid victims who have lost their sense of smell, or a family of folks having no noses. In the meantime, dolly sits with the rest of odd dolls, on a bed in a room with the door closed- could put it in the bathroom in lieu of air freshener...there's a thought. Dolly does a service!Daylight finally came- raccoons on the deck having a nosh and few grapes. One stayed behind and took a long nap. Airing out the unders.It is not unusual to have three pregnant raccoons on the deck ,  all napping at the same time, usually in this position."},

The sun eeking out from under winter sky- we know it's there, just a peek , though. Nothing for the sunscreen salesman to get excited about. When I got home -a parcel from my Norwegian cousins in Oslo, on the table. This rather magnificent large book illustrated by Norwegian artist , Lisa Aisato, \"All The Colors Of Life\". Every page, is wonderful- too many to show you. Beginning with childhood, the sweetness of it is overwhelming, continuing on with every stage of our lives, every joy...  The losses, the heartbreaks, the mending....Growing up   to be fabulous-Included in the parcel, art from the children. Oline is six and her little brother is three.This onion is older than the artist of  \"study in blue\", I reckon, but I ate it in eggs this morning anyway. A few years ago there was some nonsense going around about old onions becoming toxic after they had been sliced. Like the claim that cold water boiled faster than hot...who makes up this shite? I am alive to tell you that the old onion has not sent me to the ER....yet.  Still waiting .If you get a chance to follow the link to Lisa's paintings , you will not be disappointed. I can at least share that with you, but not the chocolate, best in the universe, so creamy it made my lips soft- I could only talk like this- \"bbbblbbblablib, llllbbblablibla.\" And I am not even kidding. The orphans found Grannie pants and wore them for the day, going everywhere the other went. A child lives here.... Fresca chose The lady with Ermine for \"toys recreate Paintings\"on IG, the only reason I joined  the Zuck.I used mache puppet, old rabbit, beads made from Christmas chocolate foil, some odds and ends, and think that it amounts to a pretty accurate representation of one of Leonardo's best. Can't wait to see what others are going to come up with, usually they are so very clever - just makes my day- sparks creativity, playful adulting.I tend to be way too literal but Fresca is the all time champion of thinking out of the box. Zombies will likely eat her brain first because - so good.Sunday is Dennis's birthday, I bought Spotted prawns for him. Nothing that can be stored in the garage, only in the person."},

So tiny so perfect, she thought of everything, the View of Windsor castle out the window, Hat gloves crown purse, Paddington, corgi.... There is even a bottle of gin on the shelf- candle sticks in the sconces, book lantern and tea table with cake.Pure genius! How does she find these perfect items and put together such a remarkable , too real box of splendor?  She stays up late at night, can't sleep, was her answer.  Well GREAT, says I- reaping the benefits!Inspired once again to look for a place to stay in London- it has only become more pricey. Impossible- to stay in a decent enough place in a decent enough area  would cost the price of new car. Of course I would want to stay for three months , maybe longer, I mean if I am going to fly all that way over  big water,  holding my breath the entire way , when I land I may as well make it worth while. Of course three months is never long enough but better than not at all.I could split my stay- a nice place for a little while and a shite place for the rest of the time- I would be out most of the time anyway- feeding the birds , tuppence a bag, sweeping chim chimmenies, - the usual londonny activity. By the time September rolls around I will have decided- September is the best month, October is not bad at all and November is starting to get festive- Christmas in England starts early and is so well done, the streets , the shops , the cakes, loads of zillions of years of tradition.  -0-But no Queen."},

To recap, as we do, the past year has been settling. Staying put, Dennis with health issues, nipped  in the bud but did require some attention and - staying put-ness.The black monolith is gone. Erik carried it to the THING room in the basement where Dennis has all of his air/space and radio gear. In the process of downloading flight simulator, in which he is the pilot and virtual traveler, he has been  well occupied. It is the real deal and could keep him piloting well into the next century. Pretty sure the space left from the removal of the big black suck will be filled in short order. Dennis has meteorites and geological wonders to shelve.I asked Fresca, before Christmas, if I should probably clear off the fridge door. Less clutter is better...she advised that NO, there are still some bare spots that want to not be bare. I left it , no one noticed or said , your refrigerator door  is too messed up, at least not to my ear. Quite possible they may have scorned my fridge door out of ear shot.The grand daughters have always thought this house was fabulously bizarre. Keeka told me that her room is just like my house and she loves it. Ok, then , that is all I need ....She has a closet of shelves housing bones, animal fur, dead birds, rocks.She is full of color, that girl! Bright!Maddie,  is hip and somewhat predictable, though she is the one who is flying around in a metal bucket in the sky, she is more dove grey. Nothing genetic, as these are my step son's children, not a drop of  my  blood in the works.Pity that I can not take credit for anything other than a cray refrigerator door.The lamb that came with the smirking cat in the mail, had a terribly injured foot. Nat straight away got out her fix everything kit , stitched the foot , Others helped calm the lamb and cheer her on, while foot became somewhat better. marginally mo-betta - still recovering from surgery , bundled in cheese cloth from Mary Moon's Fruit cake, they all go for a stroll across the table. Donkeys pushing as best they are able, straw and mohair moves slowly.We will be keeping the twinkly lights and candles until spring I reckon. Light is essential ! this is where the monolith lives now- the bridge? The command center? The retired guy's dream? Almost, he would rather have his plane for real but health of the man said, NOPE. And THAT is a good thing!! He can crash or fall from the sky without injury or metal bits stabbing him.  No blood, no fuel, no jet lag, Brilliant invention.On we go - another episode- New year -  a contrivance but we like to mark things like that- we humans. Keeping track in our calendar , clock way.  Have a great twelve months and a rabbitty year of the rabbit.

When we all got out of HS jail, and became who we were, he turned to jesus - totally ruined his sense of humor and ability to dance.  Euleta and Lindsay remained awesome.Lindsay and I - both so lucky to have escaped the suck of that little town , finding our way here- so lucky we have remained good friends - living next door to one another is just the icing on the buttercream moose vanilla cake.  Euleta lives one state away from  suck town, she is safe! Grateful to have not been married,babied, mortgaged, right out of HS, stuck in the dirt and wind.  Wasn't she a dish!!! And that guy sitting next to her has always dreamed of Euleta , unrequited love . C'est la vie, that guy...One last snap from  the olden days. Triple trio singing alto, just to prove  that  once upon a time I did sing and I did know how to backcomb, and I had eye brows from Woolworth, like a normal person. It was all short lived! And that is life! Short!"},
{"title": "sing to live, flying baby, gender fluid gods", "date": "Tuesday, December 27, 2022", "text": "\"Alas for those that never sing, but die with all their music in them.\"                 Oliver Wendle Holmes.I got up a five A.M. on Christmas day , put on traditional Christmas carols , and sang harmony to my heart's content. Peace and quiet in the dark, no one around to hear  or tell me to STFU. Singing stirs me. We grew up singing all the time, my mother sang everyday all day and sometimes danced alone in the kitchen. My brother had a lovely voice, too. I got by- but when I discovered that I could harmonize to almost any song , I felt clicked into place. Nothing like hitting the notes right on target harmonizing with a friend who sang melody. When Erik was a baby I sang to him , when he got older he was annoyed so I did'[t sing anymore. My throat closed up, vocal cords shriveled. Now that I am ancient , my un-exercised voice is not as confident as it once was. I  need to get up every morning at 5  and let her rip. Christmas carols are the easiest to harmonize with , lungs and vibrations through my head are grateful for early morning notes- anyone within hearing distance, probably not.  Christmas detritus- we finally had our party yesterday, boxing day. All went well. Everyone glad, house looked acceptable, food was terrific, so far...we may hear of food poisoning today from all diners after having waited so many days to actually have our Christmas dinner.  I ate everything and lots of it- I am fine so maybe everyone else is as well- but then I am a tough old boot, could eat nails and feel OK.Emily and Flora came over after we had torn packages apart- she taught her baby how to fly with the greatest of ease! Flora was the hit of the night , no doubt. So many people, so much noise, and she just rolled with it. Most well adjusted baby I have ever met!the kids settled down to play a brain game of CODE, - quiet concentration after the cacophony of the previous three hours!  They played in bad lighting, because they can- youth!!The evening was not without one bit of drama that occurred toward the end of the night. Someone let the pooch out on the deck while the raccoons were having their Christmas supper. Everyone screamed bloody murder at the raccoons, we may have been reported to the police I am not sure. Anyway, dog is fine, raccoons scampered away , confused , we did manage to spoil their night - they came back this morning. All is forgiven. -0-This afternoon the post man actually came to deliver that which has been held up due to weather.My Friend of NYC fame sent this card- a lenticular gender fluid white Jesus / white Mary. Delightful!! That is that, I just removed all of the hay stars,  took the tree down, swept the needles and put the tree on the front deck. I thanked it with all of my heart and am now moving on to dismantling the table and all of the lights- well, maybe not the light...until spring or until they burn out, whichever comes first.  All of the red is gone, enter PINK!Dennis is out in the world , he just sent a text of a thing he wants to buy that is way to big and ugly to put in place of where the monolith was.  (  now down in the basement thanks to Erik's muscle power. ) I texted back NO PLEASE NO!! He backed away from it thankfully. Good thing he had the sense to ask! The men folk do not have shopping skills, I reckon."},

The others could not make it out of their drives. The  transformer blew and our house became a cold  dark tomb. Bread rising on the counter, no way to bake it. Christmas eve cancelled- if everyone can make it on boxing day we will frolic  and have old food that should have been consumed today.  Pretty sure that I won't be doing this again. Pretty sure everyone will get ptomaine poisoning. Lesson- never plan a thing AND  do go to Hawaii in November , do not come back until spring!Empty chairs, empty house , dead power. happy christmas everyone!  If all goes according to so called PLAN- Erik will drive up tomorrow and the rest of the kids will drive up on Monday...maybe. The snow and ice are gone, the mound in the front yard covered by tarps that looked so acceptable when it was a snow drift, is now back to its brown and blue  homeless weirdness- I better eat another hunk of Pulla, I am feeling cranky."},

Yep, paper plates with stars on them , Christmas crackers with cheap silly prizes in them. Our railway car dining experience. I have said it before and I will say it again- A man built this house with no idea of how to live in one! Chocolate bears tucked into the napkins with a fork- in case they feel stabby in the night.  Cedar from Stella's yard, smells delish,  felted balls on a string.  There will be candles but not  right now, melted wax is not my favorite. I made sauce for the cordon bleu and sauce for the Swedish meat balls- cooked salmon for cheesy spread- vacuumed, cleaned off a counter that has not seen the light of day for a hundred years. Did laundry, I dunno the day is gone I have no idea where it went.The flowers on the deck? All of the plants, every tree branch, is covered in ice.Like glass globes. The cherry branches are so heavy that the bird feeder dropped three feet!It is drippy now though, so this freeze will be short lived and by tomorrow afternoon it should be back to normal, drippy Pacific Northwest. Temperate.Possibly Everyone will venture out If they don't at least all of this \"let's have Christmas dinner at our house\" idea forced me to clean the damned house and put stuff away, (in boxes under the bed, in boxes, under other boxes...) We got so lazy during the big deal existential covid crisis - sort of locked into  that mode.  It's all good now though! Then christmas bash will all be over quick as a wink- on to another year y'all. I intend to make a mess  and do crazy art in the corner.I gave my Crystal wine glasses to daughter in law because I do not need a million lead crystal beautifully cut wine glasses for the rest of my time on this earth- I found enough wine glasses hidden here and there , mismatched -  cheapos- but as long as they do the job that is all that is needed. They are in keeping with paper plates! I do not have a dishwasher so....Ok then, that was the day. I am off to change sheets, fold laundry, take a bath with suds and wonderful smelling salts. Best idea of the day. Happy Christmas ! AND thank you so much for the birthday wishes I heart you."},

I doubt a sumo could budge him but the wind- no contest!  In spite of the shite weather and  frozen streets, Emily and Flora came over today with a birthday bouquet, sweetest thing ever!  Flora explored, I had a basket of toys handy but she was more interested in pot holders- the oven was  baking squash, No problem she put the oven mitt on and knew exactly what to do.  Flowers for my birthday. Emily is so thoughtful - and in this weather bringing her baby , She's my girl!!The neighbors brought over their usual Christmas bonanza of various cookies, home made chocolates,  cranberry bread, braving the snow and freeze. I just say \"NO'...It is not like I do not have the gear for this nonsense weather, I do. I am just being stubborn about it. And lazy- it takes time to get all of that equipment zipped, buttoned, stuffed.Monkeys around the tree looks like christmas morning when I was five. Nostalgia - a twinge of sadness- because everyone is dead.   I am turning 76, on the slippery slide to the grave, myself. I hope that I blow up instead of dying a slow - running out of gas- death. I looked at a photo of my dad the other night just combing though stuff and suddenly tears welled up and my throat got all plump with emo...that has not happened since he died- even then I did not get emotional about losing him. Suddenly here I am - experiencing the \"feels\". For no reason other than this time of year, I suspect.  Nat delivered gifts around the house- one to a bowl full of babies and one to our favorite christmas guy. This morning the sunrise was pink , and still, and a towhee was singing like it was springtime.  Mysterious and lovely. Lucky...because moments later the sky turned to be white and the bird stopped singing, probably dropped dead from the chill. I don[t know how the raccoon are fairing- I am sure they are huddled up together in the forest...or in someone's attic, which is always a  not so pleasant surprise. Ok, so Here's me, being 76 tomorrow.

Lucky for me a friend's flight was cancelled, she was stranded in Seattle on her way to Vancouver BC From northern California. She rented a SUV with snow tires and four wheel Dr. and there she was, at my doorstep. We had tea and a banana, caught up and then she was off to drive north in an automobile that can handle the weather. We go way back , when we were in pregnant lady's jump around class. Our boys have known each other since the day they came out of the chute. Strong bond!Anyway, that was delightful - I hugged her many times and  for too long - you know how it is when someone hugs you for a bit too long, awkward,   try to make a polite escape but the hugger won't let the huggee go? Yeah, that was me not letting go. I think that I have forgotten how to hug in the acceptable -social -norm way. She nearly ran to her car, looking back with an expression of  \"what the bloody hell is wrong with you, woman...\" I probably won't be seeing her for another five years or so, enough time to  reign in and hone my hugging skills. The wind/snow built a little temple in the plum tree for the elves and snow faeries. Snow  makes pretty good sculptures It is really beautiful out there. The snow is light powder, easy to shovel, easy to sweep away with a broom.It is solstice, Orphans decided to get a tree and decorate it . The best part of any celebration, as you know,  is FIRE! The search was on for marshmallows and sticks with little success. Ginger snaps were found- appeasement for now. Nat did present a tribute to Pagan Santa Jesus, his mom and the sheep, and welcomed the days that will be longer \"forthwith\". Everyone clapped and said HOORAH. And now it is time to clean the bathroom, again. I have been thinking about Christmas dinner so much that I am sure I have overlooked important stuff. I have not gone anywhere since the big chill and do need to get more provisions- Tomorrow, maybe. Weather forecast is iffy. The lad coming up is also iffy. Who knows- The worst of times the best of times -  another christmas/birthday/blizzard/magic/ginger snap day."},

No Flora today, damn.This is the dark morning , still snowing, listening to Peter Schreier ,  Christmas in Germany. Christmas choirs singing language  not understood by me, is lovely.  Songs for the snow, the hibernating animals, the freezing- hunkered- down birds, the sleeping trees.Pagan days!Cars in the drive, not going anywhere today- the snow keeps coming down and is reckoned to do so until 7:00pm. Deck muffins. Not as muffiny as they will be - snow piling up - every ten minutes the muffin grow a bit taller, poofier.Great day to bake all of the things- maybe write very late holiday cards.Christmas with snow is just fine! It is supposed to melt by then though,  rain , freezing rain , freezing fog  will dominate the remainder of the holidays.  Driving in freezing rain can be treacherous but we are somewhat used to that. Slippy slidy. I am sure that blogs will be all about the weather today! The arctic blast dipping into the southern states that rarely experience cold. Gallons of hot tea - wearing everything in the closet with blankets on top- easy fix. WOW add three  more inches of snow from when I began  this post! Still snowing.

Sweet sweet family- Ernie still  poops in our yard,  landmines everywhere, the snow makes it impossible to determine where to step. I was also baking- more Pulla but this time i got a bit carried away with the sugar drippy stuff so they are not very pretty. The house smells amazing and the oven has kept us warm all day.I made Swedish twists as well. Cinnamon, loads of butter, I hope that they are OK, I have not tested them yet. It is my Swedish grandmother's recipe, pretty sure that I do not make them as well but who will know, right? No old judgemental family members still among the living to offer advice...and scorn. Today this happened!! His name is Finn and he is really smart already, just out of the oven already speaking all of the vowels very well. Janet is a brand new granny!See how the snow is not going to stick and how really fresh it is out there? I put lights on the damned monolith - I think it helps but this room now looks the color of a frat house on the week end.  Party on Garth! The grow -light contributes its flamingo disco glow, creating purple. Purple is a healing color, scientific fact! Purple light kills viruses, I know this because Dennis had a webinar today with doctors and people more advanced than doctors- probably  the women folk...anyway it has been determined that indeed purple keeps virus on the doorstep on the unwelcome mat. One of those \"believe it or not\" moments! He also learned that Mothers have been right all along about going out in the cold ,getting damp and catching the reason for NyQuil's existence. Muffled noses keep the mucous from drying out, the mucous is an anti-viral savior  in our very own noses!  Blurry Swedish lads dancing along the very frozen window sill, feeling quite at home. I have a few more things to bake and then I can think about the rest of it - gifts? maybe...Cleaning the bathroom for guests to use- the guests that will be here are such  well scrubbed folk- cleaner than we tend to be- germaphobes? yes, some are indeed.

I have not been able to find really good fruit cake for years. The eighteen dollar ones from a local-supposed -to -be superb company disappointed me so much that after I ate the entire ring of cake I wished that I had bulimic skills .  Thing is  I paid too much for a shite cake - kept eating it insisting that it had to  be good.... for eighteen dollars, must make it so. Idiot....Mary Moon to the rescue, my god! It is the best fruit cake in the entire world, better than mom's , better than English or Australian cakes, which are mighty good! I stayed up,  watched  several episodes of \"Money for Nothing\" , made tea, had another slice, and thanked my lucky stars for Mary Moon! If you are not familiar with \"Money for Nothing\" it is  British television  that is wonderful. Designer person saves rubbish from the skip , takes three of the saved  projects to different design experts to up-cycle, resell - takes the profit to the person who took sad old thing to be dumped. The profits are generally sent off to charity of choice by the previous owner- a win win win. The designs and solutions are clever, cool brilliantly done. Saving from landfill, recycling, and giving to charity all in one, Sweet.  Anyway, back to the fruit cake- I don't know how she made this heavenly/tipsy/fruity/nutty loaf- her skills are above and beyond that is for sure-  fruit cake is my all time fave and this is making me giddy glad!  The gladest. -0-I am letting the soft animal of my body get softer and rounder and more involved with loving what it loves! Life is short- shorter, larger sizes are fine with me.  Emily's bumper sticker- the best I have  ever seen, besides the one that says \"Tell your dog I said Hi\"!    I took Erik's old baby over to play with Flora again, poke the open/ shut eyes, find the nose, remove the diaper-Put  diaper  on old baby's head and face where it ought to go. That is how it is done and  you should know that. Flora knows that laundry, underpants, any cloth that happens to be within reach belongs on head or semi wrapped around shoulders for a sophisticated runway charm  look. Head is best of course. Flora is most certain , her knowings are strong,  her sense of style outstanding.   Great parents , great  Flora Jane, thee child of the century, more clever than all of us put together. I suppose everyone feels this sort of  hyperbolic heart explosion re:  beloveds- (BUT, just sayin' if there was a contest ...um. this one -winner winner chicken dinner!)  The lad will be coming up for Christmas , finger crossed, shaved  Portland hair cut, questionable  tattoos , a nose piercing that looks like a booger-  Can't wait to hug him and hide his keys so that , \"uh oh\" guess he can not drive back to the city- got to live in the basement at Ma's house, *snap*- pity!! The weather could be a problem, so says Don Day, our favorite meteorologist, brought to you by Chugwater Chili. I thought they would send proper cooked chili in a bottle but it is just chili spices so...meh, and nah.   We , all  under the same roof for Christmas eve, are sure to be noisy and to  wish  Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.  May overwhelm Flora.  Another year, done. Flora and fruit cake- life could not be finer!!( photo - Erik and Em Christmas eve long ago)Another slice of Mary's fruit cake , a cup of tea, and that's it for the day, or until 2:00 am,  Happy.

It will be a long wait. I have never make cordon bleu before though I have made similar just without the posh name- It is just a Schnitzel originating from Switzerland, the blue ribbon school of cooking. Fiddly but easy as pie...I ran out of expensive Emmentaler so scattered Colby cheese around to fill in the gaps - Cheese leakage- that would be  Colby and the reason one should just go buy some more Emmentaler...Cheaper than a trip to Switzerland to pick some up but, still, pricey.

She saved a squirrel's life right before my very eyes- A few tiny chest compressions, a little prayer to the Squirrel god, which , I thought, was her god too-  the little squirrel popped his head up , said thank you and Scampered away, to get caught by her cat another day, possibly.Out of the blue one day while driving through Denver- she honked at some people to hurry up crossing the road and then said the most racist thing I had ever heard, the only racist thing actually,  in a snarling, mean way. WHY did you say those awful things, Auntie, to those people you don't even know, minding their own business??? WTF auntie?I did not really know how to respond so just sat  in my  stupor of WTF-ness.That did it for me. I divorced her pretty much, from  intense adoration- to confusion - how can this be? From then on I did not believe her - treated her with  suspicion, kids are not stupid.  Where did sweet auntie learn to talk that way and how come? Even more odd is that she was a Christian Science practitioner, the one who guides others , the one who tends to your bedside as you are dying.God's girl!

She left home at age 17, went to apprentice with an antique dealer who promoted her talent as a singer and cabaret performer.  You probably know of her, I did not.  I found some trash checking through  the bins at the university art department. My favorite trash! This book of Suzy fell out in pages. I used some in collage. Did not have a clue who she was.  Here is a BBC link to her life story , condensed- and HERE is what she sounded like. I have chosen a couple of drawings - I like drawings best, they are quick and expressive, besides the big oils are what get most of the attention.I got lost in the google universe this morning looking up Suzy and her shenanigans. Came away thinking that she was one very clever egotistical creative soul  who died, lacking.When she died alcholhol and weight gain had over taken her as she walked alone , in a magestic suit, along the beach having lost her voice and her looks and all of her friends. Also , in the trash bin, Were these student drawings on large paper.Studies in veg?One quick un -finished building looming  out of the green, the only watercolor in the trash that day. I kept it for the good quality paper that I could re-use, but obviously did not. I like the water color and think that if I could do as well I would be sad to find it in the trash.   I had an \"oh for fucks sake\" moment this morning, nothing to do with art, more to do with hoarder. Enough already!My chest is still thumping with frustration.  The hoarder intended to make this room, the only room where we hang- into a flight simulator room. He bought the parts to build a huge flight simulator- that is fine, well and good...but in the middle of where we live? Living with other people is sometimes hard.  Please no, I said, you have an entire room , the largest , downstairs for your \"hobbies\"  ( which has more become another hoard). Dear lord, won't you buy me a house of my own? A studio at any rate, a place, a room away from this madness. THICK! dammit."},
{"title": "Shite Christmas presents from a child", "date": "Sunday, December 4, 2022", "text": "When I was a child I made Christmas presents , mostly because my brother had robbed my piggy bank which was not a pig at all but a  metal stage coach- free from the bank- with the intention of \"savings\"- save so much a bank account might have to be opened. Why else would they hand out stage coach banks? I made a calendar for my parents - it took forever, at least four days. Some of the months -  predictable and OK. Some were like I had been possessed, no middle ground. Mom kept it, and now I have it in the down low cupboard. I only just thought of it as I was looking for -something- I can not remember what. Thank you old age!! Skunk, fuzzy tail done by accidentally putting something on top of it before it was dry. The numbers were difficult, precision has never been something I triumphed over- It is a large-ish calendar. A good enough gift I suppose. Better that some of the gifts I gave them. They were very polite and gracious about receiving gifts from the trash of my mind! One year I made a stuffed rabbit for them- It disappeared rather quickly after Christmas- \"Why isn't it on your bed?\" I asked- \"Gosh I don't know!\" was the reply.  Fair enough, I thought it was pretty amazing- it was a questionable rabbit. The hand stitching was gappy - brown and green- I painted a face on it resembling road kill-  Sail rabbit with rosy cheeks and one ear.  One year I made for  them a cow, out of an old hand bag. It did not get great reviews, and after it was unwrapped, it also disappeared.  Hmmm mysterious, I blamed my brother because he was  most likely jealous of my skills , probably, yeah, pretty sure.... I guess the calendar was safe enough to keep - milk toast.  Nothing too weird.Bottom of barrel with this post, sorry. Scroll away."},

No thank you, covid, flu, diseases of humans!There was a dolly, A sad baby, in  a barrel full of doll parts, legs and arms and a torso - Oh dear, it looks like murder. Of course I brought him home with me. He looks like he is still in shock. What an ordeal!I waited around for Santa to show up  but realized I was about a century into the future. Oops. Sometimes difficult to get this time travel thing honed!At one of the artsy places I met a couple of artsy friends whom I have not seen for so longggg. One thing I thought was  clever and edible- earth in candy- jordan almonds, chuka cherry, rock candy beach pebbles with sea weed licorice.I got another fridge magnet as well.

By the time I got seed out for them , they had flown off to Mexico, I think. I posted this photo of fluff on Instagram as I now have an account in spite of my resolve to UnZuck my life. I did it for the orphans,  for the inspiration and to see what Fresca and Sarah are up to. Fresca said\"puffer jacket\". Yes, yes it is.After my down  town  adventure,  being accosted by beggars and trying to help a drunk guy back on his feet, I came home, nice and warm.

Below  is what it really looks like if one has more than a cardboard camera.We watched \"Good Night Oppy\"  last night. Truly gobsmacking, the tech/science/genius of getting two rovers to scoot around mars taking photos of a most spectacular planet- soldiering on for years beyond their sell by date! On the front step ,  Mars so close- we, so tiny, comfortable in our caravansary, do not have a clue of our place in the great up yonder.  I do know this , however, there are treasures to be found at the Assistance League on Senior Thursday! On my way over to Flora's house I stopped just for a look. I came away with this magnificent hand stitched quilt. It is a holy relic!     Fabric of the 30's,  hand stitched perfectly, looking as though it has never been out of the cupboard. Lord knows that I do not need another quilt -but, you know,  it is rarely about NEED at this point . I thought about for a while ,  maybe  three seconds! Sixty four dollars with the discount for senior Thursday- no brainer.  I marvel- I know of no one who has the patience, attention span, skills  (or eye sight) to make a quilt like this these days-  or the delicious fabric for that matter. Have you shopped for good cotton fabric lately? It's a desert out there in fabric land. Here it is, nearly midnight, I am wrapped up in this quilt feeling the age of it , comforted. Like a hug from all of the grandmothers , dead and gone- like a burrito of ancient wisdom , me being  bean goo in the middle.Speaking of Grannies- this one got to spend some of the day with the happiest child  known to humankind. Today she taught  monkey how to wear a necklace around its arms and legs  and head all at once - only for special  dancing monkey occasions,  it is a difficult look to sustain (suffer).     Flora Jane is  indeed the fanciest dancer and a  very  good teacher of things- monkey feels lucky and  especially glad that there are very few dancing monkey gigs.  We all are! EYELASHES!!! Brilliant eyelashes!As a child  I had a wish, I wished that martians would take me on an adventure to their planet and beyond and  in the magic of outerspace my eyelashes would grow- to my  knees- and I would have to scissor them. I have no eye lashes , we always want what we do not have,  one of the rules of being human. Pretty sure that Flora has not been close to Mars- but Mars is coming to her with it's special powers, especially tonight- go - look? Just above that chunk of cheese in the sky. MARS. A sweet little planet that used to be a lot like Earth- Earth now becoming a lot like Mars rather quickly. There is no going back."},

Lovely generous gift for  Bebe from a stranger, sort of, but maybe not...Blogworld has no strangers! Thank you Jan F. so much! This is the best ever! These are the Christmas stockings that Flora's Granny Kim felted, using wool from her sheep.  Kim is a felt artist! Kim is Emily's mother.  Makes art hats that are also practical, Warm - water repellent as wool is.  Her wall hangings are incredible as well. I am a hack but Kim knows her wool , measures and felts solidly. Great work. We were both at Flora's yesterday until it started to snow. Because Kim lives out in the county on a small farm , where snow is not as friendly as it is in town. She left, I stayed.

They are showing up in unusual places, all sizes. I made the bar keeper, Suzon-\"The woman at the bar is a real person, known as Suzon, who worked at the Folies-Bergère in the early 1880s.

The stratosphere does not mingle so  all of that water and ash stays.

This old coin is a five pound gold coin you are probably familiar with since it is considered the most beautiful coin ever struck. Queen Victoria - from Wikipedia- \" The depiction of the young Queen as Lady Una (a character from Edmund Spenser's poem The Faerie Queene, from 1590) was seen at the time as a bold design decision as it was the first occasion when a British monarch had been depicted on a coin as a fictional character.[2][1] Queen Victoria, as Una, is depicted holding a scepter while the lion, Lady Una's guardian, represents England.\"Orphan and lion with felted crazy dog pretending to be the frolicking lamb of innocence.  I like another artist interpretation of Una - one that was not a coin but is a painting in Scotland. Una is very brave to have a lion as a friend, braver still to kill the dragon that wanted to lunch on her parents. My Una is felted- the first felted thing I ever did when I was teaching myself how to stab wool. Twelve years ago I think. I have kept her because she is anatomically correct with body hair and everything lady garden - will spare you that visual. Janet has some fine art that has been in the family for generations, high rent stuff that needs attention. She picked me up and we went to have a professional framer look at what could be done because of acid burn from faulty framing in the past.  I learned a few things about gold foil and duct tape- cardboard and acidic paper. We spent a long time learning stuff and then leaving a couple of art works with the framer to do magic. Not quite ready to come home- we went to the dairy for soft serve. We broke the law for not paying for parking ...All good, no ticket! I hope your Tuesday is as fine as can be. Go play with dolls or something, be inspired.

Possibly when Ernie is dead and Flora is thirteen...Ms. Flora has realized that her tongue can move independently and can make fabulous sounds if done correctly-  perfecting her drumming skills also- getting ready for tour (her world tour is 3.5 rooms at this point) Get your tickets now- selling like hot cakes.Time to scoot- big plans for tomorrow-  Tuesday, lots of life to live , diapers to fill, books to read, scones to scoff."},

He made stuff for me all the time- I  took it for granted, as kids do, appreciating his skill and effort  never occurred to me. I mean, don[t all dads make stuff out of rocks?  I was impressed with his ability to look out at the vast expanse of dirt and sage and spot a possible gem, cut it and make a thing of beauty. \"Keep your eyes open,Sue- find something good\". \"Um, no, it's just a bunch of DIRT, Dad, I want to go back to town and get ice cream or something...\"Two bracelets - hearts made when I was about 13 and the other made when Dad was an old guy losing his vision and skill, both bracelets  lying  in the bottom of a box along with Coins I kept from when I lived in Melbourne ages ago.

Aware that there was money jingling around in there , never mind that it was just a couple of pennies that wouldn't buy anything. Aren't they cool, though? 50 pence with an older queen, magnificent! Charles is going to make money much less attractive. The back of the 50 P-  roo and an emu and all of that fancy stuff in the middle. A very pretty coin also with some heft to it!  An american quarter at the top for comparison. Going though boxes will never end- the amount of boxes that we have! Slowly , very slowly whittling down the hoard. Sometimes being grateful that I did not just chuck it all, and sometimes wondering What the hell! Who wouldn't want to keep giant money around that is totally useless?

{"title": "SUN, here comes the SUN! Orphan day.", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2022", "text": "SUNSHINE today! Shining through the window above the piano - autumn tree in the background. Colors!In the yard every thing looks amazing in the sunshine, it is happy making every time.Everyone seems friendlier, I have not had Squirrel come right up to my foot like this since Pants died. He was the most friendly,  came in and sat right down or jumped into the ficus to relax. Ernie comes around when ever we are out. She lives next door with the two little girls. Ernie is such a good girl. Loves a good scritch,  and having  a poo in our yard.Our compost is of special interest though there is nothing there for her. Tomatoes and egg shells are not really worth the sniff, but sniff she does and wag- I do love Ernie. The best part is that she lives next door. The bouquet of trees across the street in the sunshine are like a celebration all by themselves! What a nice planting.Speaking of celebration- today is Orphan appreciation day,  invented by Maple,  to honor the best orphan of all,  Juanita May, the most darling.Her father died as a result of a horse's hoof meeting with his head when she was five , her mother died in childbirth when she was ten or eleven. She did not go to an orphanage but stayed here and there with old aunties and grannies, having run away from a bad man who claimed to be her loving step father- he was not.  She never spoke of her childhood- I found information from other folks in the family. Mom did not want to make us sad so she just never said. Her story  would have undone us I am sure, so - smart mom to keep it to herself. My orphan fixation has a source. The orphans donned their Orphan uniforms to gather and celebrate the day. They found a photo online of their old orphanage and the friends  left behind, being sure that they would all find themselves well and thriving in loving homes. ( they lean toward the romantic) Tilly is the one missing from the celebration because she lives in Florida now- taming wild reptiles, tasting martinis,  and eating sour dough bread from Mary's oven. Stella made the tea party table, there are vegetables added because vegetables give you super powers.Cake is  also effective.After the tea and festivities and a quick speech by Nat honoring Little Juanita , it is  library time. Nat reckons it might be a delicious idea to eat a cookbook. Marden loves her  Sarah knit red socks! Rubbing the face of another with said red sock is part of the ceremony.  They wait patiently in line for the special red sock rub.The sun continues to shine throughout the day. Either it is a sunny illusion or it is actually warmer out there ! A walk - yes, I need a walk! I need to walk for days! I am rusting."},

Trying to make room for Christmas. Above is the large compote I bought at the Assistance league- It's a doozy! It rings so clearly when I flick it with my nail,  weighs as much as a two year old child. It could do some damage I am sure. When I bought it, the woman who took my cash  said \" well, only people our age appreciate these finer things, young women just don't know...\"  I said \"probably\". My mother had a collection of hefty cut crystal, mostly from Ireland, and when I was a young woman, I did not think much of it. so , yeah, I will stick with \"probably\".   Lemon oiling all of the chairs , three at a time because our kitchen is very small-  doing it in the kitchen so that the oil does not end up all over the place . I am not the most careful oiler of chairs. This house is built in a way that I can only guess it was some man's  bad idea- tiny kitchen, no laundry room, no work area- the sort of house where you might stack bodies but as far as any sort of living breathing hub- it is NOT!I managed to put a string of lights up- OH that is so FESTIVE, Linda!!! I cleaned the corners and shifted some things to make room for the tree , which will go where the toy basket for Flora is.  It will be a small tree. Small and tall would be perfect.Another photo of the compote because she is such a pretty thing!  LARGE she is.I have a smaller one as well that will fit beside her . It is not as sharply cut as this one , and may feel inadequate. That won't do.  This Christmas feels like it is  an important  one and every compote that participates must feel important also!An unwritten rule. Looks like the corner is getting all Sven Svenson, Oly Olson  for The Holidays. EEK-sorry for the flash, nearly put your eye out! It is dark here so without the flash it would just be a black blob. The rose bowl will have fairy lights in . Fairy lights are just the best invention-  put anywhere and everywhere  to bring needed/craved light into  corners. Another \"if I can't see you, you can't see me\" shot, just now in the dark. There are three little babies on the deck- I  want to squeeze them a lot,  and call them my own, and name them all Boopsy. So cute I scream - \" I can't stand it- you are too damned cute!\" - scares them a little but they do not run away.-0-In the middle of this day of cleaning and clearing I got a hair cut - went to  a place I have not been  before, located within a stone's throw of our house.  From the sidewalk there are stairs that go down and down and down. There is a door- and more stairs that go down and down...\"Bet you do not get many wheel chair folks here...\" No, was the answer, but no sorry acknowledgement of that failure. Adequate haircut- It took her all of  three minutes to cut my two hairs. Will I return when my hair grows back- looking rubbish? I will not.  I will go where  Stella goes, her hair always looks like a movie star's. But then, she could cut her hair with garden shears and it would look amazing. Good hair!I still have loads of cleaning and clearing to so, Three days is not enough. Dennis will be home tomorrow."},

This holy family is indicative of  just how awful everything is, for profit.Could they be any whiter or any more terrifying?  The basket is nice, I like the handle and would have snatched it out from under the  Jesus child , who appears to have impure thoughts,but it was NFS due to its job of holding the beloved plastic ,dough white, ridgid  scary baby until someone actually forks over the extraordinary amount of $50.00 for the family. Great Halloween prop I suppose but not for $50.00., not for any price really.I went to the coop , got cranberries and oranges to make to take to Middle son's thanksgiving dinner. Drove by the container village .New giant cup on top for the D.I.S.H foundation container. Dignity, Independence, Sense of purpose, Hope, for the intellectually developmental disabled to learn cooking skills and marketing and all that entails, it is a great program and the final product is delish! Also pretty great that the old Rail shipping containers are being repurposed. The one in Brixton is brilliant. They have done it right -  one of the first to make the old containers work well.FANCY!

Anyway, it will be good for travel , slow but adequate. The snow flakes are multi flake, hooking on to one another making HUGE flakes the size of fifty cent pieces.Like a ticker tape parade, It is not sticking- too wet. Trippy snow fall ! And this is what is happening indoors, a new bloom taken with IPAD camera. Pretty good- good enough.I am never quite sure what to make of people who claim to have special \"seeing\"  abilities. Immediately my brain blocks them- \"wacko charlatan\" and I give a wide berth. So, the woman I met at the Scandinavian fair reckoned things about me , though we had not had a conversation, just standing in line...  Out of the blue, big smile on her face she claimed that my mother was very close and that she was with me during some recent trauma -  I could not think of any \"trauma\" off the bat, so I just said \"Hmmm.\" I gave no indication that I had had surgery- how would she know-  then, on my way back home , I put the visor down to block the sun , it has a mirror on it which pointed directly to my messed up  neck. The scar is becoming very visible and the flesh around it has succumbed to gravity , cut muscles during the surgery has made my neck look  like wadded up nylon stockings that got too close to a flame.  Of course-Obvious! I think that folks who consider themselves as \"special seers\" are simply hyper observant...confident  and bold enough to speak it. That said, how did she know that the  surgery episode  felt like all encompassing love and well being for a few seconds lifted me right out of this mortal coil, and put me  on  the road outta here- feeling fabulous! Is that what folks mean when they have near death brain activity that feels like  the most glorious light  which corporal  body melds into and becomes all twinkly? Dunno, I mean Opium does not even hold a candle to that high ! Hospital drugs are mighty fine but not that good!  It was  very brief . When I landed back in bed \"mother\" was my thought, as well as  \"I want to do that some more, please! Kill me now!\"....I thought. If that is dying , oh boy, what a treat! And was George Floyd seeing his Mama when he called out to her? Probably.... Anyway, I liked this woman immediately, A sweet happy kind person. We shopped together , appreciating all of the same things enthusiastically.  She was like a comfortable bedroom slipper , like an old friend. That in itself is interesting as I generally avoid  getting  chummy, especially with a stranger! We talked for about an hour and a half after I walked her to her car so that she could show me some little pewter objects she bought earlier in the day.  Truly it was like catching up with a pal I had not seen for awhile.  She reckoned it nothing particularly odd that her experiences are well, ODD. . It just is but she said that she was nudged toward me by something other. Ok, well- whatever, \"nice to have met you. Stay well.\" She gave me her number and said to call sometime, I said \"sure\"...won't but that was nice of her and the universe \"nudge\"....maybe. Who the Fug knows, anything can be true , anything can be  \"I WANT to believe\"- and as false as a big daddy in the sky.  We know nothing. Perhaps people who observe so well are just  really good readers.  I met a good reader and it was -good.-0-And this just in- Barbie Jeep Racing. To compete in this sport, you’ll need steely nerves, plastic wheels, a steep hillside and a refusal to grow up. “Barbie jeep racing” has gained popularity as a zany offshoot of offroad festivals in several states.

I got there 45 minutes before opening and the line had already formed around the building. I forgot my mask, the crowd was close. Fingers crossed that the virus was not floating around. I bought stuff, big surprise. These wool roving cards were made by two little girls and they are just brilliant. Three dollars apiece. So under priced- when I went back to get more they were fairly well sold out. Of course they were! I came home with treasure- an antique Dala horse and a more recent one, a knitted mushroom and gnome, straw weaving, this one is rye from Eastern Washington. The wall of Solje (SOL-ya), brooches was amazing, dazzling, bright and shiny- I bought one to go with my little one and that will be all I need to wear for Christmas to look fancy.  The prices were remarkably affordable- as it always is at the Daughters of Norway. Online one might pay a fortune, I have looked, crazy expensive.The baked goods were abundant sold out the entire two walls of goodies immediately as that is where most folks head first. There were no dried goods this year, usually I buy two bags of yellow peas for Norwegian soup. Not today.Wanderlust- Sand in my shoes, itchy feet-  the long dark winter has only just begun. The Scandinavian fair took the edge off  a little bit. Plus three new-to- me orphans arrived today. They helped cheer me up  while I fiddled with the  IPAD trying to do tech things by myself - I have a salty vocabulary wanting to get exercised- I had to go out and clean up the dead veg  in the pots on the deck to get my mind right, came back in and fiddled more, fiddled well, finally. Tech really is not my friend, I sound like Lupo the Butcher  when trying to figure out tech shite. The camera on this ipad is twenty times better than anything I have had so , when I am ready to travel I will BE READY! Better be soon, no body is getting any younger.This is my sparkling  Solje- Tough choice they were all wonderful.Not a bad way to spend a Saturday. I met an intriguing woman- I have to let it settle before I write anything about that meeting, it was so unusual. Home now, lasagna in the oven, about to watch more of Whitstable Pearl on amazon video, stay up late, and hope that the virus did not ride home with me.

As light as it gets which is - dark.The rain has returned feeling like things are getting back to normal after a long dry, hot  Indian summer. Living in this area is challenging as far as  health goes.  MS and Parkinson's disease , crumbly bones, immunity issues, diabetes and heart problems are all considered to be results of lack of sunshine. Not to mention serotonin and circadian rhythm becoming compromised. We were not meant to live indoors in the dark. Back in the old free spirit days we lived outside for the most part because outside was just as comfortable as inside, where a glass of water froze solid overnight on the kitchen table. That is not terribly unusual, I suppose. Point being that even the dark sky outside had enough vitamin D power  to keep us well. Now we stay in, and it is doing us no favors. But, you know how it is, we look out the window and say\" EWWww , no thanks, Mother Nature, not today.\" I will stay in and eat all of the  bread.  This , click here, is a short article in the Smithsonian regarding  darkness and the effects on health. England has more light in the winter-  tropical in comparison.  Little wonder that I feel happier there, tea, biscuits, sausage and mash , art and history at- every -turn. It is entertaining to be outside in London, no matter the weather.The darkness creates  illusion- mirrors are not so scary and a self portrait can look magnificent. When I get up in the morning and wash my face I look normal, because it is dark,- I am, in reality, in light,  far from anyone's  idea of normal. \"Holy cats! Who is that?\" Also the dust in the house is invisible. Bonus! A screen shot of Nancy back in August that I found \"honest\".  It is early to be putting up fairy lights for Christmas but that is what I am going to do today If I can see well enough through the darkness to plug them into the socket.  We  so appreciated the bright days of summer- San Diego weather without the crowd /cars/  pollution/high prices/big bucks/ and more crowd. It felt as close to utopia as one could imagine. Nomad lifestyle suits us- especially since we have no livestock or ag to tie us to one place in time. Another reason to be pumped about Keeka's little Aristocrat. She has the right idea!There is one listed on Craig's list in San Fransisco for 10,000 bucks because, the ad states ,\"It is worth it.\" Here is what one person has done  with theirs, there are many that have been dolled up on pinterest. Would be a great addition to the vehicles in the drive- use as guest house or studio or get away from each other for five. If Keeka becomes discouraged I have offered to buy it from her- no problem.

Posada was a controversial and political cartoonist that was liked by the people and who drew and etched skeletons (calaveras) in a satirical way to remind people that they would all end up dead in the end. It is said that he drew the dandy-looking female skeleton with a fancy feathered hat because some Mexicans had aspirations to look wealthy and aristocratic like the Europeans at that time. A satirical drawing to remind people to be themselves and to stop trying to be something that they weren’t. No matter how rich or poor you were, no matter the color of your skin, and no matter what society you belonged to, you would all end up skeletons. This was Posada’s message with his many caricatures of cavaleras sketched doing various daily activities. One of his most popular sayings was “Death is democratic”. \"The one and only La Catrina that I have left has seen better days. I did have about ten at one point. All  in different  dresses but same style. I kept this one because her foot has broken off- and also, I am fond of her.-0-Autumn is beautiful right now, just before the wind takes it all away and  grey settles in.This is our enthusiastic weeping cherry.

There are colors that I have no names for- what would you call this color? Every year I drag out the \"compost\" painting that I did when Erik was in middle school, and every year Dennis says \"oh that is nice, where did that come from?\"  And every year I remind him...Seven deer in the yard this morning. Frisky, leaping and getting very close. A young buck  is chasing a very young doe around and around.  He nearly ran over my neighbor. Marijo has returned for a couple of weeks , visiting her parents. She comes twice a year though I think it will be more often now that her parents are in their 90's. She left the USA for Holland about 25 years ago , for better health care. Better politics and better life in general. Smart girl. Steve asked that I post the glass thing  I did in a workshop at Erik's middle school, having posted Janet's , which is far more interesting- I have posted this one before ,probably. It was inspired by the \"WATSU\" that Janet bought for me for a birthday long ago. I was very impressed with the WATSU. Heavenly- traveling back to being safe and warm and supported in amniotic fluid.  Anyway... it was fun making these- simple, and , as  stated, this one looks like broken glass stuck together, which it is. Watery colors are nice, though. Day of the dead- I will give my Mom's ashes a Mum, her favorite flower, and Dexter's ashes will get some rice and chicken, his favorite.  I will help him eat it because , you know, no teeth."},

I tend to take my money and stuff it in the mattress, Dennis stays, as he has always done)- buy new products today , like Iphone, Ipad, stuff where China has a monopoly- tomorrow you will not be able to afford them.

It wore a zillion stickers of blue grass festivals , has seen some good times. The seller/owner said that if they removed all of the bluegrass stickers it might fall apart.  Grand daughter, Keeka,( Jessica) has traveled extensively alone in her  Cooper  everywhere she wants to go- which is EVERYWHERE. Adventurous little soul. Everything in her world is small and manageable, She moves like a sprite, all 99 pounds of her.The sale went well, the lad selling it was awesome. Builder of beautiful things, garden, house, landscaping the side of the forested mountain. Sensible. Two of his friends were there also, being remarkably helpful and knowledgeable. One lad, that I truly enjoyed chatting with, lives in Bellingham in Emily's neighborhood. He grew up in Benoni, just outside of Joburg SA. He also found himself  in Wyoming working at the refinery six miles from my home for a spell...we laughed , knowing how shite that was!We shared our terrible stories of the terrible places in the middle of dirt and wind . He reckoned Benoni was similar to Rawlins- we agreed that we  had a leg up on living on this planet- If you can handle those  soul sucking  areas, and actually make an escape, you can handle just about everywhere else- Mars? No problem! Everywhere else in the world looks do-able and pretty  great! He also lived and worked in London for a while, after leaving South Africa- for good!  Lovely lad- he and his wife have decided NOT to have children, being fully aware of the dire earth situation and what little time we, as humans, have left on this space rock. We laughed that even apocalyptic days would be a cinch  having grown up in the places we did, but no reason to inflict that sort of survival on a youngin'. They are considering adopting ready made, off the rack, children and  will not contribute to a way- too -many -humans situation.   ---There she goes , out of the woods, down the mountain, mini cooper pulling her old/new digs.

How many times can I say \"thing\"?We followed behind to make sure there were no freeway issues, she scooted along perfectly.  You can see that the Lil  Loafer has been put together with screws rather than rivets which is  great for taking apart to fix. Absolutely LOVE this little \"thing\"...thing is good.Storing it here until next week end when she will come back up and retrieve it. Her Mom does not know about this new plan of hers and  will be freaked, for sure. So, breaking in the idea slowly will save her mother from blowing a fuse and possibly exploding -or just melting,  seeping into a crack in the floor.  Mother's worry.  Wallace, the dog, and the two cats can not believe their old friend is driving away- dang, that was their club house.

It was built in the year 2000 for the world's richest folks however no one lives there now. The houses/buildings/mansions have been abandoned due to faults - like leaking pipes, flooding, leaky roofs, sloping floors , wobbly foundation. Unreal!  From there she went to the mountain of the second brother where witches were buried and where the gallows were at the base of the mountain. She crossed a barbed wired fence and was stopped, asked for papers, and instructed to leave the mountain quickly. Her home town a war zone. so frightening and so sad.

The little candelabra was provided by a woman traveling with us who turned out to be a child in a woman's body , but way more irritating. That is a story for another day and one you probably would not like to read.  Pumpkin cat.In Hampstead with Olga and her humans. We walked to the heath on a lovely autumn day. Olga was very patient waiting for Sarah and I to finally find our way to the flat and then settle in for a cuppa with Dave before Steve , drumming his fingers, and Olga, jumping from foot to foot got us out and up to the heath. Very patient folks!After that it was just another London day- you know, the usual....people walking to work...hanging out in vans, dressing remarkably well.Sarah ate some kind of mushroom...She became tiny.I have about 4 million shots of my happy place. These are just a few at  the end of October. Sarah getting some distance.Great British frugality, making it work. Repair re-use, save. learned from experience, especially through two world wars. Probably will come to that again. Buy quality wool, DIY. I stopped in at an exhibit of a stitch in time .The entire display was stitchery, all sorts.This white jumper was a grannies, saved through four generations in a most artful way.  And  other stuff....There were cloth sculptures, stitched heavily. Amazing work - there were microscopic stitched works of goat gut vellum. Lord, who has the eyesight for that?? Some were so unbelievably fine and some were sassy.  I could go on for days with photos from that exhibit alone. But this is not the place- who has that sort of time?I am so pleased that Apple products make it so easy to marry their devices together- it is one big apple love fest here on my table at the moment! Olga defying gravity."},

Every year the kids went out for Halloween and every year came back ill. We could count on it, building immune system- getting ready for winter chill. This morning, just now, on the deck railing, the little family of mother and three babies leap frog over one another, probably just to amuse me, viewing through the window. After that fine performance maybe kibbles are on order. Yesterday I went out to the weirdest location to find Christmas Crackers.  At first I went online to see what is available- discovered \"Olde English Crackers\" warehouse is right here ! Just a little way out of town  in a nondescript stretch of strip mall looking warehouses and business buildings, very nearly invisible with a tiny sign indicating \"this is it\". Inside is stocked with English crackers, some expensive with \"better\" gifts inside and some the usual  fare from England. The lower shelves are the ones hand crafted by this company individually made, shaped differently from the English crackers but of better quality. The price is indicative of that as well. The man there, his business, said that if it were not for Amazon , which he loathes, they would not have a business so - make friends with Satan sort of deal.  We chatted. He lived in London for eight years working as a researcher for The Natural History Museum.  His children were born in London but he failed to obtain dual citizenship for them- of which he is very sorry. The political climate is fubar in England but worse here. Plus...Guns for toddlers and monkeys second amendment bullshite. Anyway good talking to a real human instead of Amazon."},

I went to a store that replaced K-Mart. I bought a flower pot but it took forever because the new shop is unorganized and did not have the pot in their file. No price. I reckoned then , that it must be free. I reckoned wrong.They have all of the junk Christmas stuff up and running.  Horrors- although the gay tree is enticing.When I go to Flora's house I take a bag full of \"'things\" and then I bring them home again. Number one because the \"things\" are generally not the sort one would want taking up space in a tiny Waldorf household. This was Erik's very first Dolly, which he named \"Eat-a-Cookie\". Flora , fascinated by the dolly's eyes that open and close using her tiny thumb. Gay slinky was a hit.I went over early so that I could catch up with Emily  before she went to work. She was a bit shaky. She is in a  young MOM dance troupe , they performed the night before but Em did not go because her hip is still whacked out . Her friend danced , had a great time, her husband picked her up, on the way home a drunk driver nailed them. They were able to drive home, thought they were OK,  and went to bed. She awoke to a terrible head ache, went to the ER and the damned ER said, \"you're fine, go home.\" . She collapsed in their living room  - could not be revived, dead. She has 24month old twins and a seven year old . So, yeah, Emily was a bit shaky and sad and in shock. Drunk drivers are not forgivable, not ever. The damned ER is like going to a house of horrors with five year olds tending the injured. I stayed with Flora Jane for six hours- wore me out fairly well, though we managed a nap on the sofa, baby girl asleep on my chest where my heart pounded like a happy hammer. You know that love is just a four letter word until a baby happens...Chests  explode .Dennis came back with a mug from MeowWolf and a tale to tell. His first observations were that Meow Wolf is for eight year old boys,  he did not realize the art of it and the complexity of the games throughout , the clues - he mostly just saw lights and weird shite! No surprise, the man is consistent, anyway he was glad to have gone- closest thing he will ever come to interactive art or mind altering Owsley. Nice mug.In the post today a nearly shredded frock for Bernice came. Fits her in her frumpy raggedy way. You may remember Bernice, in case you need to be refreshed- I found her in a trash can in Port Townsend when I was very  young. She had no face, was fairly well beaten up with sprigs of green/brown yarn sprouting out of her head. Trashed.Poor thing, Brought her home , washed her gently because of fragility- she was already very old, embroidered her face with sewing thread because that was all I could find. Used buttons for eyes that I found on a tossed garbage shirt. Her  orange hair was free from the yarn bin. Bernice has been with me for over fifty years. A calming influence- been played with by many children, drug around through the pig pen, dipped her hand in a pot of paint, seams coming undone. Her new frock is from the 30's , in the same condition as she is. hang in there Bernice- we are not done yet.Dennis willed his body to science- I really hate that idea so talked him out of it- he rescinded his gift this morning and told them that if I die first he will still be a donation for med school. If he dies first I will plant him in the lovely cemetery and get a wonderful stone for him- something from meow wolf.I will continue to visit him- one sided conversations are the best!"},

I don't know many who do, Addition is more intuitive/ instinctive. She does not like anyone to leave. She has yet to meet the Jehovah's witnesses.Her favorite book is the sounds of barnyard animals - pig and cow especially. Complex characters.Smokey sky in the pumpkin patch, Sunglasses help keep eyes from burning. The pumpkins make good pals, quiet, polite, patient, they can not leave on their own, and I think they are not interested in doing so.  Flora can leave them but not the other way around- so it's all good. In the parking lot at the bakery, where I bought savory croissants stuffed with Gouda and roasted turkey to take to Flora's. On the way home the sky being weird,  dark but sunny.  Not sure what it is doing. My disposition today is that weirdo sky. Must be change of season. By Flora's house, this cool tree offers a small jungle of climbing around, in and out the trunks, a good game.  It looks like the tree that we had in the back yard when we first moved here, where the neighbor girl had her fort but also where a cougar had it's nest! Down came that tree.    Hope for Ukraine. Always on my mind- BLM always on my mind. Manifested in photos that are mostly accidental takes!  Speaking of BLM- the lad phoned from Portland this afternoon. After 2.5 years of anxiety,pain and expense the city finally settled. A pittance really ,  the attorneys taking the lion's share which is expected, it is over , finally. and the police in Portland are just as horrific as ever. They are pissed off at Erik for settling, he must watch his back. Messed up town, Portland! Erik is planning his escape. Maybe the weirdo  sky is ambivalent because life is -  or could just be October witchcraft."},

Autumn is lovely. My brother and my mother , both born in autumn, owned the season, my mother decorated and  my brother shot deer and elk.. Our house growing up changed decor with the seasons as was done back in the olden days of the fabulous fifties. Autumn was the most colorful and outlandish, Mother really nailed it big time. Cornucopias and dried leaves and lanterns on ever surface, Not a space left un -done. She wanted to dress me in orange, I complied but   I thought that I looked too much like a pumpkin. Vermilion was better and rust was nice for my pale, mealy,  colorless, see through complexion. Mother always looked amazing in autumn colors- Brown hair and dark eyes - rosy cheeks and fire engine red lips. Such a beauty! She was Juanita.The rain has come just in time, overdue, in fact, the forests have complained and caught  fire.No one  else is complaining about the exceptional fall and summer we have had. Sunshine in the Pacific northwest is rare and marvelous. Chill in the air, the house is cold- the deck of flowers and veg will want cleaning up this week but for now I am clinging to the very last of it. The deer are back - I startled one in the back yard this morning- we surprised one another, both jumping away at the same time. Looking back at me wondering  where I came from all of a sudden, me wondering the same about the deer. They are looking winterized.Giving me the side eye....Old Mrs. Plum's days are numbered, how I have loved this tree. It was initially thought to be a flowering dwarf, same with the monstrous cherry when the original inhabitants stuck them in the ground in the seventies. They are only supposed to live for 30 years max. I should not be surprised that Mrs. Plum is so very knackered. My skin is beginning to look like hers, lumps and bumps and gnarly bits.  We are both on the down hill slope of our experience on this amazing planet. Wheeee what a ride! I pretty much have done all of things! Of course I always want more because too much is never enough- greedy! Leaving you with a tomato that will never be in the salad of life- Compost at best.have yourself a great Sunday- I will continue my deep clean of the abode. Maybe roast a chicken.

Getting ready NOW so that I am not stressed in December. Well, there is always stress in December but you know what I mean. Clean house happy heart, glad tidings.I shifted the shefflera  and the avocado. Both are growing madly! The pink light encouraged them too much so the shefflera went to the front window and the avocado scooted over out from under the light where its top was bonking the fixture.I had the big dog rug cleaned to the tune of $312 .00 - It is so clean and bright that having it  cleaned was a bargain at any price.Dogs have had their bottom scooting, face wiping , muddy paw  tracking way with it. Not to mention the window people  with their untidy man ways. It is always something- since the window guys came I have noticed , even with my poor vision, that the scrapes and gouges from that venture have left the walls sad, wounded - needing to be painted , AGAIN.  Seems I am always painting the walls, like the golden gate bridge,  back to the beginning when you reach the end, never really ending.I am dismantling my little \"art\" corner. Making room for all sixteen people to sit like normal folks at the big table in the middle of the room , where it belongs, instead of scooched over to the side.  This part is a drag. I must store all of my paper, paints, pencils, clay, pastels, oils, scissors,  brushes,bits and bobs-somewhere else. Since I cleaned out my little storage unit I now must  shove everything under beds. That is how it is done in the land of bad house keeping. I need more beds.Orphans are pretty sure there must be some royal event about to occur - all this cleaning fuss- and they have noticed that some of the dollies have been boxed up! Horrors! That has made them nervous...Clearing out the china hutch for NOT dollies! Possibly for ...china? Well, that is just crazy! I even got the ladder and took the panels out of the  kitchen ceiling where the bugs had a party and could not leave- like the Hotel California.  Loads of dead bodies, all sorts. The wasp was king-  an inch and half long- I suffer no remorse for his death.Anyway , I am on a roll , washing everything including face masks  as well as the entire damned floor with vinegar and Method. Only have today left to do my worst! Dennis comes home tomorrow afternoon. Bringing in some of the plants from the deck to bathe in the pink light of growth. I have made room for them.Orphans consider my hyperactive cleaning frenzy worthy of celebration and a little party for tiny dolly, name is Heather- she came from Colorado through the mail!  The Octopus is Harry, from England, also sent via the post! Brave Journeys! And now for a cuppa and a biscuit and a pat on the back. I will be cleaning well into the night."},

Unlike my experience in every way.Stella was born under a good sign- luck follows her.                                                       In the clinic, peaceful and smooth.After dropping her off I took donations to the charity shops- on the corner of  the one that I will not donate anything to, a guy was playing an accordion-  as two people danced spontaneously. Tango. I could not just leave boxes of stuff at the Assistance league without going in to see if there was anything that I must have to replace the donations , madness- the circle is madness...Tatting and two guest towels plus a little wagon for Flora and a glass thing- I spent four dollars ! Dennis has gone to Las Vegas  is meeting  oldest son there- going to a skeptic's convention or something. Son wants to take him  to Meow Wolf  in area 15, It is a recent installation I think, and is said to be Disneyfied rather than artsy. Dennis will certainly not know what to make of it- Shopping in the Omega Mart with virtual Willy Nelson. I am staying here, shooing raccoons away, as the little family has  invited every raccoon every born to congregate at our party house. They have made two latrines in the back yard and have torn the already compromised screen door to shreds. It is like school when one kid misbehaves  the entire class gets punished! Time alone! I made scones and ate four! I watched a bad movie. I can not be trusted to adult well it would seem! The smoke is supposed to clear by Saturday- we are promised rain - and once the rain starts it won't stop until June."},

Yesterday was very dense with smoke, the air quality in the red zone of \"Very unhealthy\" but not quite \" you are dead \". Hours spent with Flora were the best of any. I took  kitchen measuring devices and a large plastic snow globe, purchased at the dollar store, double tight lidded- I filled  it with ballerinas,  Sparkly balls, fake fruit, and glass tear-drop beads (for sound effect). Both were received well. especially the kitchen measuring cups and spoons.  A Tolo baby that was Erik's, fitted perfectly into the largest cup.   The girl can dance,  wish that I had my camera on when she did her moves, amazingly coordinated- arms out just right, hands rotating beautifully , like an accomplished belly dancer's.  Her control and balance is astonishing - I just sat on the sofa , stunned. \"Oh My GOD, baby girl!\" Then she read fourteen books in five minutes - on to the next big idea-The wooden rack  thing is a climber. She climbs to the top- wants to go farther, can not quite make it over the top to climb down the other side but will do, probably in the next ten minutes. Next week I will watch her for a couple of days - then the little  family are  going to Arizona to see the 93 year old grandparents, who have their dyed in the wool Old Country ideas,  it is like shifting heavy wet cement- they are likely to be mean to our little unmarried, illegitimate tattooed family, unnecessary and hurtful - comes from a place of fear and inability to change, pretty much what that generation is all about.  Anyway, Emily loves her grandparents, wants to see them before it is too late, never mind the  side eyed judgement. Flora Jane will ease  all nonsense.  If that does not do the job , well then, bloody hopeless!This is Em's new tattoo. Skin still flaking- tattoo settling. OUCH! When Gitana died  , her group , her tribe, all got the same tat in the same area , \"Gypsy\". As time goes on  political correctness alters names, the term \"Gypsy\" became another \"N\" word. Thus the reason for the new tattoo, to cover GYPSY, and to honor Gitana in spite of the name cover up. Gitana died from the poppy,  unintentional, tragically young, we miss her, our spirited, talented, beautiful one!We all start out  well, so much promise/ optimism. Life is hard- slaps you silly and then spits you out a shriveled, broke down, hard ridden  keffel - BUT before it takes you altogether, a gift is bestowed upon thee!  And there is light!

Dancing skeletons, partying and being joyful! Magical grave.  bits of nature left as gifts- shells, stones with holes bored by the sea.

It's one of the answers to the energy gap. It's essential to our response to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.In the history of civil nuclear energy, there have only been two major accidents where a large amount of radioactive material was emitted: at Chernobyl (1986), which has resulted in 46 deaths so far, and at Fukushima Daiichi (2011), which resulted in no casualties.Ok, so if it malfunctions there could be a lot of babies born with three ears, or whatever happens to life after such an event. So far Nuclear power (NOT bombs) has not killed many folks- coal has, oil has ,burning wood and peat has...Maybe my earth Mama values are in question at this point in our de-evolution.  Embracing that which was at one point in my thinking - abhorrent. speaking of babies - Janet needed tags for her party packages so - these-Water color and ink stylized botanicals ,  and on the back (because I kept too much paper  after my  so called purge) I used  Japanese and Indian paper.  Purging continues today, purging and saving, dammit."},

Cubby's mom's  trip to France was NOT uneventful. She had a fall , seriously  smacked her head on pavement , split open like a coconut-  ambulance came - took  her to the ER, where she was assigned Box #2- urgent care. France, with its superior health care and ambulance service, kept her from bleeding to death, kept her brains inside her skull , stitched , scanned and bandaged- not without some measure of difficulty as blood spurted out like a fire hose covering walls, curtains, floor, doctors, and Janet.  the medical professional that was sewing her head shut, fainted, pulling her head down with the sewing thread attached! Oh dear. Then, like the champion that she is , she took the car to Paris.     Our lunch was excellent, mostly for the  good company , mind you, and the REAL spumoni ice cream!  Next to the restaurant is a newly installed story pole, from \"The house of tears\" carving studio, Jewel James, master carver. Janet reads the stories on the plaques below, but none seem as grand as her French misadventure. She is fine, thanks for asking.Cheated death once again!This morning,taking it slow and easy. Have you ever seen such a plump raccoon?Beautiful autumn we are having- It could not be more perfect.Orphans decide it is time to take the bird for a walk outside in the sunshine, not too hot, not too cold, Goldilocks weather. Convinced that their bird teaches all other birds their languages, Bird speaks many, even the exotic bird languages only heard in the jungle, They are doing the bird community an educational  favor. They begin in the cherry tree, but think it may be too high. Though their bird can fly, it's skill is limited to four inches off the floor.They reckon the base of the tree , in the morning sun might be just the place- Nat warns Maple that without shoes on she may find splinters- \"I will take care of this\", Maple is glad  especially because NEW DRESS! She wants to look like Yayoi,  dots are the thing, all of the orphans think so.A deer just bounded out the back- They are here again , using our yard toilet."},

The world is on fire- figuratively and literally. Americans' rights are being rolled back. We've lost a sense of collective truth. Maniacs and racists massacre innocent people, innocent children, and our leaders are too polarized, or too feckless, to take any meaningful action. Extremists are ascendant, authoritarianism is en vogue, and with two years to go until the 2024 election, our system of government faces arguably its biggest crisis since the founding of the republic.  \"2024 is gonna be, um, you know, not a dress rehearsal,\" Maddow said. \"This is the playoffs . You know what I mean? Like, this is high stakes, really important and determinative of our future as a country. And that's not a fantastic thing. That's an edge-of-my-seat kind of thing. That's how I feel. I don't feel  fantastic about it. I feel like I'm on the edge of my seat, and I'm convinced of the importance of this moment.\"( Excerpt from Vanity Fair)And so, Rachel is going fishing, headed off to other projects. Cable news has been dying rapidly anyway, so good luck Rachel. We will miss her- though we have only watched her on you tube for the past two and half years.

Patience is a virtue...-0-Last night I watched \"Kusama Infinity\" , Amazon prime, documentary about Yayoi and her art. She is 93 and still living in the asylum ( since 1977), still producing art in her fabulous way. Inspired, Marden paints the Squash that I brought home. She loves  bright pink hair and thinks nothing could be finer than to live in an asylum in Tokyo, be walked across the street to your very own studio to art all day, be walked back for dinner and slumber. \"That's the life!\", Marden asserts, though not all are convinced.  -0-Driving home after returning a pair of Blundstones because Australia's size 8.5 (5.5) is really a size 8.  You know how buying on line goes, iffy at best  and it takes soooo long to get the order. No instant  gratification. On our street, dead in the road, beautiful but not  an exceptionally bright Flicker probably got nailed by a car. Wasps  dining  on it's blood , I could not just leave it there. I brought it back to our compost in the back where at least it will not get smushed into the asphalt. The raccoons will find it.  And I got to see and hold her up close, lovely thing. I am keeping a few tail feathers, and I will remember her fondly.  But , really, Ms. Flicker, the sky is the place for flickers - the road certainly is not."},

Thank you Mrs. Spider for your assistance.The mountain ash is  a show off this year. Bright vermilion out-shining the red ones.  This color gets stuck in my eye -I want everything to be bright vermilion at the moment. If anyone asks \"what is your favorite color\" I am not sure anyone could answer that. Favorites change from moment to moment. Today it is this!Cedar baby nurseries are abundant - All of the conifers are pumping out potential. Nice time to gather them before they get too fiesty. Snow berries, plump and sassy. Soon the bush will be full . It will look mostly  round and white, I identify with this bush especially when it is at its fullest.One of the leaves that was not afraid of letting go- now what? Turn brown,  crispy ,  mix with all of the other browns on the floor. \"ACK, what's it all mean?\" Existential crisis in the back yard.The bottom of my  shoe found some brown too- Ernie goo. The dog next door likes to use our yard for his  pooing fields. I do not mind the deer,rabbit, raccoon poo but dog poo is just not my favorite. Tracked it into the house before I realized, Ewww. Dang what has that dog been eating??? Other than our compost, I mean.Spiders are our friends. They are very fat this year and plentiful. I welcome them into the house to take care of the cleaning issue- moths and flies and gnats- unfortunately they like the bathroom best, the shower in particular.

Jocko thinks it's real,  unicorns exist only in France. Jocko wants to be French.  Flickers make a funny chatter when they are fighting for territory or flirting, I could not tell which. They were serious about whatever they were doing until they both fell from the tree and ran down the street.  they did not fly, they ran...weirdos. Today has been most perfect! I walked to the neighbors  to return her book , the one about anti-inflammatory diet. It is a good one, just say NO to wheat,dairy, cow, and sugar. Kind of a no brainer. last night I watched \"Hector and the search for happiness\". It starts with a good idea , along with  unbelievable cartoonish characters.Hector is a shrink located in London (the best part), who is fed up with his patients and his inability to help them find happiness. He takes off on a research adventure, to China, to Nepal, to Africa...The adventure holds up OK but is so ridiculous that for a moment you forget that the movie is trying to  maybe be profound.  The ending is super dumb BUT- the questions that stuck were;When in your life were you truly truly truly happy- like slapped silly happy,  \"high\" happy, but not high? I could zero in on four times,  brief  moments in time. The feeling of that sort of happiness should be illegal... I swear, when I think of them I do want more of that! Almost a religious experience and I could mainline that shit! It is surprising that my moments of utter happiness are not what one might think, all four are very simple , not grand at all.The next question was opposite: When in your life have you been at the bottom of the barrel in morose  sad trombone sadness?  Way too many of those - I choose not to revisit those times, thank you. I guess what I came away with after watching the whole silly thing- is that happiness is not what you think it might be and you do not have to chase it. These are quotes from hector's notebook;And this is a happy girl, before the heavy crown."},

I particularly like this one , it is so formal!The steps with side tiles is in Flora's neighborhood.Texture is superb! a headache for the home owner.Some one once told me that this apartment house , hidden behind other houses, on an alley that is inaccessible, is the oldest apartment building in the town.  I doubt that but it is made of the same old sand stone of others built in the late 1800's. It is a cool building, a cool place to live, I saw the inside one time when we were purchasing jazz cabbage back in the olden days of smoking banana skins and alfalfa.Bright feather left in the yard by  flicker. Unusual to find their feathers unattached to them. They are stingy with their feathers.Deer have been absent for nearly two weeks . I don't know what happened, maybe a cougar , maybe killers with guns, maybe the city rounded them up- I don't know. Things are not normal, I needn't tell you that...For instance, there are three babies on the deck in the morning. Late babies! This one is my favorite. He was born with a wonky tail that looks like it has been stuck on with gum. He is so cute and a bit of a trouble maker.He gets told off, Mom is not having any nonsense , not today,  Little Mr.Time out- funny baby with the sideways tail, his feelings were not hurt but he got the message, after having a \"think\" he waddled off to climb the cherry tree with his siblings. Orphan Harper is anxious for October, as she has named herself Queen of the Pumpkinini and will lead the festivities! There are plans for birthdays , fancy dress and spices in the tea. Likely there will be more fairy chairs made and possibly pumpkin bread. October is a lovely month. Our leaves, because lack of rain, have just fallen , thud,  without the thrill of changing bright red/orange/gold- Crispy ocher and burnt sienna, looking like brown paper bags wadded on the ground.

We waited, Dennis stood on the corner for three hours , I waited in the shade and finally in the car. I glanced at the building and saw a red hat headed up the stairs, he had come around the back way , good thing I was not on the corner with Dennis, he would still be standing there eyeing every car had I not been the Queen of observation skills!After the signing which also took longer than anticipated , the attorney was amusing, very likable, though he said that I looked like Liz Cheney....We were very hungry.

He is dead now, I don't know about Peg. They went to Alaska, he left her there on her own 63 miles above the arctic circle.She learned very quickly how to fall a tree, chop a cord of wood, make kindling- no choice, her  tiny cabin was an old miners cabin, heated entirely by wood, naturally.  Above is a drawing of her table, parka, knife, bow, the usual.She learned how to make mukluks from a native woman - \"kill two caribou\" is the first step.  Alder is easy to split, makes great kindling- After awhile on her own  Peg met Ross,  the only trapper in the area and learned the ways of collecting animals in a snare. Not easily set plus- 60 miles through snow , snow shoes and dog sled. She learned to read animals  and how long the foot prints had been laid , which way the animal went , who was traveling with it. \"Wolves have diamond shaped prints.\" Around the margins of her letters were  drawn footprints of the animals that she had followed, with descriptions. Ross taught her survival, how to make mittens, parka, everything from the animals. He had all of the knowledge. She probably taught him everything else, that is my guess.As in the New Yorker,   art spot ink drawings in the small empty spaces between paragraphs or at the end of  sentences.-excerpts from her letters. She stayed in Alaska as far as I know, she was so good at it, but  because I am not a good tracker I lost her . Don't not know what became of our Peggy. Now I read \"old woman of 73\" like \"That's not old, darling!\" To a nineteen year old I realize that 73 is ancient, already dead.During our correspondence I was  vegan, a soy bean , chard eating - all peace love and harmony love child. I was vegan for years, until my blood ran white, then I ate a sausage and bought leather boots! Best thing ever! I have never liked to eat meat- we grew up eating game , and that gets a big nope from me. Never been a fan, but that sausage was heaven! -her tellings of the northern skies , the northern lights, the dark dark Cosmo filled sky, so clear and twinkly she doubted them, was sheer poetry. Such  a life for one so young who did not know how to wield an ax when she first arrived, Quick learner, trooper, hearty , beautiful  child of the wild! So that was our Peggy, where ever she is I hope that she is well."},

That is it. This morning I awoke at 3:00 am, feeling seasonal vertigo coming on- got up to get an anti -histamine, looked for them in the thing vitamin cupboard...found many , all from 2002- 2009. Decided to clear the vitamin cupboard and OTC's that have been there since ever. Filled the trash can, go back down to bed , but wait, I see a box that was shoved at the back of the closet! It might need going though too. The box contained old papers and very old letters from the 70's. Letters form when we were all \"potential\".  The thing that my friends and myself did when we had all the time in the world, was send art in our communications. Along the margins, sometimes front page of letter, sometimes to start a new paragraph, but the exceptional thing about this habit is that the art is pretty amazing! These are from my friend who moved to New York when she was seventeen. she sent beautiful letters!  This is just a sample of her exquisite , spontaneous art  in the letters. Her envelopes were also artful. We have not lost touch though our lives are completely opposite- the roads taken, sort of deal, interesting how the bond is solid, though, we get on as though we never left the same page.We met up in Wyoming a couple of years ago and it was splendid. Then covid- then no more travel- you know how it went.When I went on my walk about, I mailed letters to my parents frequently. No camera back then, no phones or other conveniences to get in touch , other than letters. I drew a lot of what I experienced in  letters home.  They were quick-ish drawings using a rapid-o-graph, small nibbed pen that kept clogging- these are the one's that fell out first. Glad that I kept them.When I sort of settled in England I bought air mail paper that was so thin it was transparent- I wrote tiny to make the most of the postage. This is just the salutation of a lengthy letter on the back in tiny writing. And this is what I would do while sitting under a pear tree on Great Sheephurst farm where we worked until winter.After my three year walk- I came back, lived off grid below the mountain where I had a year round garden, and a boyfriend I picked up in Vienna. He was really Australian but his father was American , so that sounds more reasonable. We  only met in Vienna. We carried on for a few years, he and I, under the mountain with the face- then I went back to London and he found a new girlfriend.I continued to receive artsy letters from  my friends. It was just how we lettered back then. The chubby guy came from a letter written by my friend who was in Morocco at the time. Glad I kept these letters,  is  good.Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby, below,  was the cover for a letter that I sent to Lizzie , in Maidstone, Kent. No Instagram back in the olden days! No emails, I must say it was way more fun to get a letter .  Drawing of messages/letters began with my sister friend, Euleta and me, when we were in high school. We wrote/drew notes, such grand  elaborate, funny notes, passed in class to one another. I wish I had kept those. They were genius!I had another friend at this time, who located 64 miles north of the arctic circle , at age nineteen, to live \"native\"! I will post some of her drawings tomorrow if I remember. We met while I was living in the harbor. Anyway, the past  kept me up until - normal folks get up. A nap may be in order in about five minutes.   I got the letters sent to Lizzie back - They were sent back to me because I hoard \"important\" stuff. The recipient thought that they were not bin worthy, I guess. That is me planting blueberry  bush. Like i said , there were many  letters from the olden days, that was our snail paced social media back in the 70's."},

I have to think of things to do to keep spirits up. NOT reading the \"news\" is helpful.Orphans pretend \"going to school\", they are so smart that they don't need to go to school, they know everything. Our little neighbor girl has just turned four, I think I mentioned, and is going to school...she is not happy.  Too early I say, let her be a baby girl until at least age six, but no body asked me...Today would have been my brother's birthday if he was not ashes in a bottle.

He loved the outdoors,  a ranger for a bit,  taught biological sciences in high school in Nebraska until he got to evolution and Darwin - that did not sit well with the \"Nebraskans\" ,  because bible...he got fired, went to work on the railroad- like Dad, like Grand Dad.  He  hunted, fished, lived in the woods, worked on a ranch - did all of the big brother manly things.  I loved him  so much, especially when he was not punching me in the face- training me to not be a sissy cry baby. \"Don't cry\". I have that down pretty well, now, and can be stoic when needed. The loss of your own- one- true sibling is the shits. I miss him. He died too young- colon cancer, I said Bub- bye over the phone held up to his ear by his wife. I said \"love you\" and he said \"I love you too , Squirt\". I said that I could still beat him at gin rummy and take all of his money. He laughed and then he died. Thinking about winter now that the earth has tilted away from the sun- winter and gifts.  Saving  little sticks I find, to glue together , using silver ragwort for the back of a fairy chair.  Flower press flattens them well, Books work too.   \"Yeah look! I made it myself, specially for YOU, you are welcome!\" - ( disappointment  long face  falls over  recipient. ) Merry Christmas!Christmas taken care of, wouldn't you say.  Everyone has everything they need or want so why not give them something that they can  compost?  Earth friendly. Ok then, I am off to the coop to buy veggies and spices and millet and legumes- hummus , tahini, and fruit.  Dennis and I could not be more opposite- he is now doing carnivore/fat diet and damned if he did not a find a book that knows all about it and its superiority over veggies/legumes/fruits/and nuts....amazon offers anything you need to shore up your ideas...If I wanted an ice cream soup diet  that is \"good\" for you, \"better than anything\"-I bet you a nickle I could find it. here's is to my Happy Birthday Brother- running the skies with Odin."},

Can't wait for that event!this is the tail end of the boulder bit- moving snail speed - I am thinking that it must be one helluva crash somewhere- or that a truck overturned spilling  its contents all over the freeway, I am hoping it is piglets- or that a plane crash landed and there would be all sorts of interesting plane pieces to collect. Moving along semi excited at what it may be to back up traffic like this. It was guys in bright suits cutting trees and eating them with their tree eating machine...what a let down. Anyway , it took an hour and twenty minutes to get to Stella's house which usually take about 15. Plus her plants were still damp. Cubby did not like the trip at all-  but managed to find something dog fabulous to roll in. Well \"perfumed\" - we came home and this no fun human gave him a bath. What a spoiler of hard won  doggie fragrances.This time I wore my rubberized industrial  apron - stayed dryer. Took Cubby for another walk after he adequately dried himself on the big dog rug. That is another thing that must be cleaned soon. Just have to find a good cleaner, ours is no longer in business- as with many things these days... pretty sure you have noticed.His humans just texted me that they are back in the states, will pick up the pooch tomorrow after they have had an adequate night's sleep. His things are packed and ready- he probably is more than ready, His humans are very important to him.  Our marathon walks are over.-0-Berries are great this year.  The blackberries are so sweet due to lack of rain. We walk the alleys and pinch blackberries along our walk. Cubby is not fond of them . I eat his share. I met a friend along the way - we conversed about the change in weather and how our joints act up . She lent me a book written locally re: diet for arthritis/ inflammation.  She is living proof that it is beneficial and must be tried. Sooooo- gearing up for it, I am never successful with this sort of thing- changing to a radical (to me) way of eating.

She slept like this for a long time- she slept like the dead.She is not a pretty queen, she has been through many battles , obviously,  maintaining her dignity and pride.  Side to side like a bull dog.

Ok, then, that walk is over.  There were a few dogs to sniff, some ducks to wonder about, a decent poo , picked up and binned. A few walkers , a couple of swimmers. Uncrowded for the first time in a season of HOT days. Loads of warning signs around the lake regarding swimmers itch and other buggy bacteria- enticing?

Dennis went to  Germany to observe eclipse in 1999, he was gone for ten days, during which time I spent my Dad's gift of  inheritance $$ removing carpet, replacing it with Pergo ( which was only supposed to last for ten years 23 years ago) made the kitchen less of a postage stamp size, increased cupboard space, carpeted the stairs and the basement. That last idea was not brilliant as  another flood flooded,  all of the carpet went  to landfill. I bought the \"BIG DOG\" art story rug from Dale Gottleib, I bought \"Twins and  String\" painting for one wall. Erik and Dale's son skateboarded through the empty raw house.Ten days is never long enough to make better a shite kitchen ,to remove  shite 70's carpet and to paint the interior with a two inch brush! I hauled all of the furniture out to the deck including Timmy , our lovely  egg laying turtle- too much chaos  for this one person to remember to water her and feed her fresh earthworms from the garden. That is a sadness that will follow me to the end of days. I murdered Timmy,  but I got the  house job done . Dennis came home, furniture still on Deck , walls drying , didn't cost him a dime or effort so how could he object, really. (he could...  he did)-0-Sorting out the shelves beneath a cabinet yesterday I came across so - much- stuff!! A  huge stack of \"happy Birth\" cards from when Erik was born- into paper recycling they went- no sentimentality there, besides I could not even remember most of the well wishers.  Records of paid bills, clips from the local news paper from the beginning of time- into the bin. Still the cupboard seems to be quite full. I saved all of the kid art and art from our friend , David. When Parkinson's compromised his movement and gave him the quivers, he made art by blowing through a straw,  and using his thumb. His art is delightful at this stage in his illness.From the pile - this very bad paper camera photo, early 80's when Dennis and I barely knew each other - Dennis in his round butt dockers helping me carry harvested apples to my  tiny  two room  cabin. I was at university, sorely needed free food- Pop corn, apples and plums for breakfast and dinner - scheduled a class at lunch time to avoid thinking about how I might be a little bit hungry, sometimes  smoked a Camel Straight , nothing like a Camel to quell hunger, a trick I learned while living in  Poverty London, but there it was Old Holborn roll your own.   I bought the VW bug from a friend for one hundred $, rarely used it , walked everywhere. It only went 40 MPH but danged if I did not get a speeding ticket going 40MPH in a 35 zone. Like I could afford a ticket. Went to court and  got slapped with a twenty dollar fine.  A  substantial amount for me with seven dollars in my account, still needing to buy Uni text books, time to call Dad. (again)So many more cupboards to go through, to decide Yay or Nay.  In the meantime I will put that job on hold, take Cubby out for long walks until his humans come back in another ten days.This is where they are now. Mont-St. Michel, France. Then on to Paris.A much needed get-out -of-town jaunt. So jealous!"},

It took years to complete  the dock, well worth the effort - probably the most favorite part of the inner urban trail ,  once  an industrial dock ,  refurbished to its glorious quarter mile long  \"bridge\"dock over the salty sea.Dress code.... I thought this was little kids vehicle coming toward us.Pedal powered, the guy rides in the bike lane. Enough space in the back for a little child or groceries , whatever small thing needing transport.  The driver/ biker got this thing to help with his injured -surgeried many times -wrecked legs. Cost a bit more that PT ($20,000) but  is cuter and gets the guy out in the fresh sea air. I think it also gets  some measure of attention from people like me, this could be his social life.On this lump of waste from olden day salmon cannery(   a massive  tin  wad - resulting in  a small island) the rogue sculpture mysteriously appeared in 2012, remained for a year and then mysteriously disappeared just as quickly. This year it appeared again, likely to stay because the city said OK.  Made of sheet metal it weighs a hefty 400 pounds. It's name is \"Grace\".  We walked  to Fairhaven and back- went to the park at the end of the dock, wandered around for a couple of  hours ,  much \"splooting\", started home as the light was dimming. On the dock a nearly invisible bit of graffiti. Because you are what it says you are.That was Tuesday - time to take the pooch off to slumberland where he will woof and his legs will run through good  sniffing dreams."},

As we were leaving I said \"long live the King\"... it felt so wrong. People are still pretty good about wearing masks - no longer \"the law\" just a good thing to do , forevermore.  Helpful in the forest fire smoke also.But tell you what, the smoke did change Cubbie's demeanor, He became  anxious and needy- I felt a bit out of sorts, head ache, today it is better. Cubby takes me for two long walks and has two poos and two dinners when we return. Cubby can only count to 2.For  you who were curious , this is the guy of the lawn art today. If you had an interesting story going on  in your head about said art on the lawn... keep that going, This man's story is not as interesting as what you may have invented. Anyway I thanked him for his works and for thinking of doing  this wonderful thing on his lawn. He said this will probably be the last of it since autumn usually brings rain...none in the forecast that I can see.Went through the car wash to get rid of the ash and the ash film on the windows,disrespectful to have a dirty  Queen.She is well stuck on- the car wash did not shift her a bit or wash out any of her color. If I ever get into a smash up , I am sure that that sticker will survive intact. Dollar is up, pound is not-  London may be affordable after all. Looking into it in my fantasy time.

I seem to find myself there after every death of importance.  For the woo woo there is an orb ( produced by sunlight and lens), the Orb is clearly the wrong kind to inhabit a spirit  but still...poetic.Also woo woo, my blue Queen quit waving!Out in the full sun of yesterday, she waved weakly and then just stopped.No more waving- now I guess I will have to have an orphan service to  send the Blue queen up yonder.The Royals are so over for me- died with the queen, the only royal in that entire family worthy of  our adoration( though the Irish and some colonies would disagree) Anyway... Smash the damned philandering patriarchy- hand the crown to  Kate and call it a day.This morning-  the sun through  smoke , blurring the atmosphere with weird light and un-breathable air.  See the smoke in the plum tree?The red area is the reason-  we are told that there is indeed a \"fire season\"- not as horrible as years before but we still have very dry days before us - no rain in forecast. It is the dying season, I reckon. While I am in the moan zone - there is this: I bought a feather mattress cover thinking that it would be all lovely and soft and warming, resulting in fewer  heavy blankets in winter. As I slept I felt ,through two pair of sheets and a flannel sheet, prickly bits  like bug bites all over!When they said FEATHER they meant  stabbing feathers, not down, not culled -for -quality- feathers,  poky, not sure what to do with it. Shopping online is sometimes not the best option but it is  not like we have choice now that  brick and mortar  have closed in this town. Everything has changed ,   the orange horror  broke everything, Iphone proof of  police brutality and blatant racism glaringly obvious to all, no change there other than visual proof, covid, mutations. Queen E left at the right time- no waiting around for Thwaite's Glacier catastrophe, a torched earth, nary a drop to drink. This is not ending well.  Death of the Queen , tampon Charlie taking the crown, Harry being utterly snubbed , the Queen's favorite grandchild arriving at  Balmoral on his own, too late....unbelievable familial cruelty but that is how they be, I suppose, you know, for the good of  the commonwealth, or something. And ,if I have not moaned sufficiently, there is this- yep, the knees told me this morning."},
{"title": " meander around the loop and into the forest", "date": "Friday, September 9, 2022", "text": "This morning Cubby takes me for a quick walk around the block. We discover the fancy sidewalk that appeared overnight. When it rains the sidewalk will become even more contrasted.  We are not sure if we are to follow the lines, walking drunk?It ends in a child's game of hop scotch, but we do not follow hop scotch rules.One thoughtful neighbor made a bench along the sidewalk in case one needs to remove a pebble from shoe or just sit because climbing the hill can be  a bit breathless. I have a gag reflex when told to \"enjoy\" ...it is like \"LOL\" or \" god Bless you\". ACK! Bench is a very nice thing to provide, though it is  cold stone- hemorrhoid producing. I will find any reason to moan, moany moan. We march on  to the trail where the trees smell like autumn and the sun is at a lower slant. Light has changed, mood has changed and it feels like the only staid stability in  our lives has gone, feeling upended. Weird not having Queen E somewhere on this planet. Moving on...We come back through changing leafed forest, dusty pathways  to meet the neighbor in the drive who tells us that there is a smoke alert.\"Get out your filters and fans, the bad air will hit us soon\".I am sure that Dennis knows where they are in the mystery garage.There is zero concern  by one little dog, whose attitude is superior.  He just rolls with it all and as long as there is chicken dinner at 5:00, no worries. His humans are having a wonderful time- their itinerary is packed full!The food is french fab- and I will be surprised if they ever come back.I slept with the window opened as usual- awoke to a shivering pup beside me - ahhh poor Cubby. Closed the window, drew the curtain - all was well.  Warm."},

Sea is stormy, there is a hurricane out there.This is Cubby's room at camp Hoofnagle. Short walks yesterday, still recovering from the long walk the day before. We met a man who liked Cubby very much, showed me a photo of his dog, another Shih-tsu  , died two weeks ago, man so sad.  He said that they were tempted to get another dog- but they are getting too old. He said he has been married for 60 years and that they , he and his wife, had never had a disagreement. He waited for my response which was incredulous- and then he smiled and said \"that's bullshit, marriage is a paradox and I guess that is what keeps us interested\"...  On the deck this morning taking flower photos before they are totally gone- I snapped the brushes in the window because I like them ,but, got a bonus. Crazy reflection  - looks paint worthy. That is what triple pane windows will do, jitters , cool distortion. The flowers of course are fading as they should.Still very pretty in their autumnal way.Sunflower not even bothering turning to seed for the birds, just giving up in her droopy gown of spent petals.This color combo is utterly  gorgeous.The snap dragons continue to snap ,  not minding the cooler mornings.Coleus has been enthusiastic all summer and now is loosing a bit of pizazz, but not entirely, the colors are stunning.There is another painting on the lawn, not sure if they are cycling around- peat and repeat- seems that we have seen this one. Who can tell really, still life is still life is still life.....nice execution though.Daughter in Law grew Allium , this is a spent one ,   fire work explosion . She also found  a rude surprise, the neighbor had planted a bush at the back , along DIL's fence inside her garden- Caper Spurge. She does not know how to get rid of it. It is a substantial size and if or when the pods blow Spurge will be everywhere taking over her garden Advice is to get rid of it as soon as possible, but how. It is so toxic that  it poisons everything it comes in contact with,  causes many poison-ish  problems. Here is an article from a plant person about the bush. It is a cute plant, with adorable  pin cushion seed pods but do not be fooled!!  Unless you want to become a beggar covered in sores for sympathy (great use of a poisonous plant) there is no reason to have this bush anywhere near you.

First he chooses the familiar walk through the neighborhood- Sunflowers tall as a house , the fence is a little over six feet tall.Cubby veers off to the  right, to the forest where usually there are dogs and people to talk to , Not today. Just one lone dog...Cubby.This is the \"punching stone\", so called because of a homeless crazy guy who sat on this stone and punched dogs in the face. He was reported several times . The final straw was a little old blind girl dog that tried to sniff around his shoes. Guy punched her in the face...Ok that's it, dude,   I called the police, the dog's owner called the police, the store up the way called the police. FINALLY the police responded.Walking to town, where this shop must sell chickens from France, essential shopping, you think? Must I buy three hens or is it that the shop only has three? By the time we got to the turning point to go home over the bridge, the clock told us we had  already been walking for 2.5 hours . Heating up, time to \"sploot\".   Right in front of some insurance agency or something . It moved in after the bank left, having been robbed five times. Usually third time is a charm but the bank just could not get a grip. Denial cost them as denial usually does. More walking, over the bridge, to the middle school- Sploot. We stayed there until breathing became less panting and more normal. Kids in school , and so it begins another season and here we go , into the least pleasant seasons.  Moan, complain, blah blah.Finally we arrive, melted and ready for a snooze- crossing by our rock wall that the deer broke. The larger of the stones on the side walk  weighs  at least 250 lb. Pretty sure I won't be able to stick it back on . Dennis put a traffic cone there , good thing because, walking in the dark of 4:00am , stone could present a  stumble problem.  Nap  now. Cubby is already passed out. Long walk for tiny legs."},
{"title": "creepy drawing, Cubby takes over", "date": "Monday, September 5, 2022", "text": "Feeties have been in the worm juice. It looks nasty and probably is but the raccoons love to play in it. I could live without the worm factory on the deck. I am sort of hoping they freeze this winter. Not that they are demanding  or anything, just that they lack personalities. They do not engage at all, just scamper/wiggle into the darkness  wanting to be left alone.  Cubby  is getting used to being here again. Six walks today,  a case of the poos probably from stress or who knows what keeps him checking the door and vocalizing distress. Otherwise he is fine. Played with the little girls next door , mutual love. The littlest girl is going to go to preschool tomorrow , first time away from home and the day will be long. Preschoolers go all day, kindergartners only go for half days every other day.  Difference is that preschoolers may take a stuffy with them for comfort- the big kindergartners are on their own.   While Cubby snoozed( finally, after a very long walk in perfect weather) I scribbled an eyes shut - woman and cat. I decided to tart it up a bit with eyes more open seeing color that goes where it ought.The paint did not help make it look less insane and I like that. The cat became a demon,  and the woman with candy floss hair and one tiny boob is clearly challenged.Another walk for Cubby, I am done for today.He discovered Zippy , stared at him for a long time but when I got my phone to click it, Cubby had turned to the wise ethereal bear for advice.  Bear tells him to not monkey with the monkeys.So, that was our holiday...I am so wanting to go away, far away for four or five months , would be ideal. When Amtrak comes back to town I will take the train  to down yonder, spend a lot of cash, see the lad, and feel like I have been somewhere. Way too much togetherness these past few years, you understand."},

Daughter- in -law's garden is spectacular this year. She went dilly dahlia crazy, there are still more to bloom but we are running out of weather for this year.She prefers magenta/pink/salmon and blue for her delightful garden. She has been ambitious! I mean REALLY, the entire back yard is full!The two story high cake was a success. It was pretty good - I used a bundt cake pan and filled the center with blue berries and cream. May not look magazine worthy but I will say all that butter and cream did please the cake eaters.Came home a bit late, watched more Doc Martin (Shut up, stop talking, sit down)- and scribbled eyes shut - One is Ugandan woman carrying water ,from a BEAMNZ  live stream- and one is obviously the gold fish at the spa. The saving grace is the splatter of paint that I rather like. Sunset over the island in front of Son's house. Beautiful evening and one that I reckon will be remembered. Only two grandchildren were there, the other two are traveling through a few countries before the parents meet up with them in Paris to go on down to Morocco.  Grandson loves London, wants to live there...of course. and has been offered a job , so fingers crossed!And of course Erik is in Portland throwing mud and getting tattoos and trying to stay alive. Cubby is coming over earlier - like in about five minutes- so I will be walking for the next three &1/2 weeks...The wind is whipping up and the temperature is falling rapidly. Cubby may not be the boss this go around."},

Tomorrow we are going to a BBQ so I will take blueberry /strawberry cream cake- The berries are still delish -late this year, due to the rainy spring/summer that was more like winter. Seems we have had maybe three weeks of summer- REAL summer- not long enough to do much seasonal stuff,  squeeze into a swimming costume, or get a sunburn, or choke on fumes trying to water ski , being dragged down under the lake because, no skiing skills. Mums are already out in abundance. The flowers at Joe's are smelling autumnal.I did not buy any- waiting for prices to drop and for  bright red orange ones, my  choice of the day always.Like this sunshiny Dahlia! Dahlias are great this year. Dinner plate, in your face bold as you please. I am about to make the cake of my dreams, getting geared up is half of the process.  When i used to bake I could whip out baked stuff without effort now it is  a big deal.  I have not baked for a very long time. I am the only one in the house that eats cake- and everything else. I am trying to commit  suicide apparently , according to Dennis, who realizes the toxic effect of sugar and carbs.... Anyway, BBQ inspires me, salads have become  tedious , so,  cake with fresh berries might be just the thing for  the end of summer Hallelujah- before the slump into autumnal apple/ pumpkin/ spice everything.  A quick draw with eyes shut. ^^^^ On Beamz this morning we went to a Park in Amsterdam, A guy on a bike and  a woman on bench holding her  shopping were the \"inspiration\" - there were no apples or blossoms on the trees but one can do anything one wants to do with a pen/pencil, a box of paint-  eyes shut. Rarely do they turn out to be  so acceptably  hilarious.  I could do this all day long. Hyper realism, oh yeah.OK- cake- fingers crossed-  not baked for such a lonnnngggg time. If I screw it up there will still be time to make a meh salad or drop by the quickie mart and pick up twinkies.  -0- The gig with Flora's care is off for now. The cafe failed to get a food servers permit.  Cubby is coming at the first of the week - he will walk me around and keep me honest.

The large monkey is  Mr. Bim Zippy, the sort that I had as a child. Made by the Columbia Co. ordered from Montgomery Ward in 1952 \"From Santa\".It came  from Ebay, a much better purchase than the  Zippy that smoked a pack a day ... That Zippy was made by Rushkin and was a more expensive monkey back in the day.  Cuter and more hug-able. I loved the one that I had because it was large, he was a buddy , we were  more equal. He could ride with me on my bike like a normal person.   The Hermann Jocko is a prize! Soft mohair with a squeaker that sounds just like a chimp. Anyway, all of them together look like old men on a stoop talking about what old men talk about, laughing at their own jokes, as old men do. The straw flowers,and the statice that grew in our pots on the deck, have been put in the enamel pot just for safe keeping until I decide if I want to go to the trouble of making stems for them. Some of the orange straw flowers that I got when Cubby took me for a walk, have blown out their seeds like a puff ball on top. I saved them but really doubt that they will find their way to soil next spring. The novelty wears off and I agree with Steve about dried flowers- they are dust collectors. I took this in the morning -  relaxation. Oddly the flamingo disco light reflected in the glass door blanketed the raccoon like a fairy's flight. This is my Janet. She will be flying off to France on Tuesday, allowing her pup to stay here for as long as they are over yonder eating lovely things , going to a wedding, meeting up with family - french kissing, the usual. I have my Mary Bag  and am smiling not well, but Janet is doing a fine job - for good reason. Maybe if I had a trip planned I might manage a better, non half-assed smile. Been thinking about going to London in the fall- however finding a place that is reasonably priced is hair pulling madness.  Rent, taxes and additional fees mount. I am not a rich man.Besides travel at the moment is probably not the wisest thing to do.I saw this car passing me on the road, and thought it said \"Vote Republican\".  I had to hurry to get behind it to flip them off or something equally as rude but realized that it said \" End Democracy- vote republican\" Oh, well then, OK, you may pass....sorry.-0-When The lad was here to help Dennis do some heavy lifting ,  just as he was going out the door to return to the city I snapped this not so good photo - am astonished at how tall he is, especially coming  from pygmy parents.  How does that even happen?From their T-shirts looks like Dennis is going to outer space and Erik is going to hell. Either place sounds great to me. duh jokes:Why did the old man fall in the well? Because he couldn't see that well!What do you call a factory that sells passable products? A satisfactory!Why did the invisible man turn down the job offer? He couldn't see himself doing it!      ------they could go on like this all day."},

It is a sweet neighborhood. The houses are old and small, the lots are too. People use every inch for gardening, the public right of way  are used as well, gardens are taking a chance of being harvested by anyone walking down the sidewalk, but that does not seem to happen in this neighborhood. Respect! (Although we did taste the grapes and admired the figs that may have to be tested when they are fully ripe. ) For the most part I think that people leave them alone until the gardeners say \"help yourself\".There were four ginger cats,  a couple of them  followed us , this guy did not, clearly the boss of gingers ! Funny how neighborhoods have one variety of cat- ours are all black/white or just  solid black from the feral colony of Fairhaven. Grey tabbies seem to stay  up on south hill.  That's pretty much it for diversity in cats.  Along one garden- cinder blocks that had come undone from the barrier, painted like books tossed in the garden. The  charming park ,where Charlie got his bum washed with fountain water and a leaf,  just down the street from Em's, called Elizabeth Park. Summer evening are generally full of  live music and folks sitting on the grass with wine and cheese. Sounds good to Charlie, still recovering from his cheese binge. His digestive system says \"NO\" but his doggie -eat-it-all says \"more, please, I am a starving orphan\".I love the houses in this neighborhood and the political sensibilities for the most part. Love the Bernie sign still hanging on.Organic gardens, sharing the abundance of their  harvests.  Neighbors borrowing tools, and returning them. Mr. Rodgers seal of approval! Just one street up , however , is the absolute worst nightmare of a house ever- The  \"TRUMPO\" house on Utter St. The entire house is covered with propaganda , posters,  vile slurs and hate.  I would take a photo but I would likely get shot- plus I do not want to give that pit of despair more attention.  Little old wooden houses - side by side - large mansion- ish houses from turn of century - old century.Some have historical plaques on their fronts- and some are like this little humble wooden dwelling. The gargoyle weirdo house that seems to be getting more grand by the day, now has a purple light under the  king gargoyle on the roof,  looks impressive at night. Halloween all year round.This morning- look who came in the post from our Fresca, in Minneapolis! Lovely mohair monkey made in Germany by the Hermann company . Delighted to be mothered by a momma bear, making him feel right at home , as though he has always been here. Fresca is a champion of orphans and stray animals that find their way into St. Vincent  de Paul thrift shop, where Fresca keeps the books tidy and the shop happy. She is one of the good ones !  Best -and just when you think that she couldn't possibly be more best, she betters her best!  Inspiring Spirit of best-ness, our Fresca! If only more were like she!-0-Four on the dried up grass this morning,  just hanging out in the perfect temperature. 69 degrees. These are the days we long for. Please, somebody, invent a bank where we can deposit  these lovely days - cash  them out little at a time when the long dark winter bankrupts us. Orphans celebrate Zippy , fresh from his ordeal of cleaning, being scrubbed, vinegar-ed and baking soda-ed.  Dried in the sun for days, a much happier monkey now. I removed his clothing - washed  it, discovered  a torn leg and a broken arm. As well as the inside of his mouth with two  significant holes , stuffing coming out. OH DEAR. Poor Zippy came from  such an abusive home!  Better now. Stuff- just stuff, you say- some stuff is better than other stuff- I would rather look at an improved toy monkey than just about anything more sensible, but that is just me- failure to adult."},

He plays oboe , trumpet, piano and this flute which has a softer ambience  for a small garden party than brass. Next year he will bring his trumpet, he threatens... Eleventh grade , AP, too cool for school. Going to China next year to study Mandarin, culture ,  and food...mostly food.  He is a seriously bright  student so I am reckoning that academics may interrupt eating everything under the Asian sun.

Flora appreciates a good smile and a sweet boy.Table, overloaded with  salads , BBQ chicken legs - sauces and dips, crisps and buns, pulled pork , corn on cob with handles,  babies eat like grown ups, I am amazed- no special baby gear, no special baby food- The only difference would be the blueberries, squished so that the round -ness of them does not get stuck in a baby pipe. Bottles are not a thing with this lot- drinking from normal glasses with straws! Talented babies adulting well.

Charlie , the cool dog wearing shades , was offered  cheese, And cake, And  pork, And  whatever the babies dropped.  He did not let that opportunity go unrealized. Remember that Charlie is on a special diet due to his epilepsy and fragile digestive system. We took Charlie for a walk to the park after his binge - he,  pooing diarrhea along the way. Good job that he did not poo at the party  crawling with  babies. Charlie is thoughtful that way.   -0-Before everyone leaves,  moms go through the mountain of hand me downs , sorting what they think will come in handy for the next year.

May good fortune be hers.another yawn on the lawn- find something to appreciate...well, the largest tree in the foreground is rather nice, and the yellow snow is a plus... Speaking of yellow snow, I was really not taking a photo of this doe in the yard, she just happened to be there when I looked more closely  after uploading photos.The only moisture this tree has had in a while... Remember this curly willow? I stuck a three foot tall stick in the dirt seventeen years ago and this is what is has become!  It is huge, It also has lost many branches  over the years, would be larger had it not. Anyway, Mr. man said that he wants it gone and wants the plum and Cherry pruned extremely hard , which means Killed.  He should live in Eastern Wa. for that bald land look.One year ago- squish face  baby girl blasted into our lives with such enthusiasm. She is such a glad little person. This planet is not good enough for her. Getting more challenging by the minute. Good luck , children of today."},

Oh well, next year is , as they say, another year.  And we will be smarter.The flowers are still being cute, especially these pinkable, kissable darlings.-0- The mail came. I found what I thought to be my Zippy monkey on Ebay, my childhood pal. It came this morning and it is going right into the trash. Dammit! It is a disgusting thing - smells like it lived in a  smokey tavern for 80 years, on the floor, in the men's toilet. Not saying how much it did cost, I am insane! I may take pity on it. I may try to make it a better object because it does have a face and who can dumpster  a monkey face? I  reckon that I can not...Maybe with enough vinegar and baking soda it might be brought back from the dead. I dunno - I just want to spank the seller!No  returns!   I could not leave well enough alone, cushion for Flora Jane- I pounded some circles on it - it looks festive, impractical I suppose but ...loud and woolly.She can roll it around if nothing else. I have one more circle bit  to pound and it will be done I think. More stuff to take up precious little room in Emilie's tiny house. I will let her decide- keep or trash. Stabbing wool does make my eyes hurt, scratchy stinging red blinky. Another hobby art form might be something to consider, unless I do this just so that I can complain , part of the joy of art. Arting and moaning ,  napping is good, also.  Weather man says that we are headed for a few more hot hot hot days.Will I have fond rememberings  when the PNW chill makes it impossible to get warm all the way through?

The orphans have followed his advice, and been inspired to become more of a caring medical couple of students. They are especially fond of taking care of bears .All shot up with anti covid juice they feel free to  remove their masks in certain safe situations. Dr. Fauci, is well and truly thanked. He leaves his position to the orphans  , of which they are honored and attentive. The medical profession will be better with orphans in charge.

Flora's BD party is Saturday.  I watched a flicker . It looks like it has cataracts. Not as shiny as a normal flicker. I think it might have been hard of hearing too. I crashed around and it did not even notice. Usually they are jumpy. Flicker- my spirit animal perhaps, not the jumpy one, the blind and deaf one, I thought my spirit animal was a wolf , but I have changed my mind. I relate to this old worn out  bird. Wolves are too ambitious.Emily is making a crown for Flora's First birthday.  Look at what Flora made in her mouth!! Teeth really make a difference, where  did gummy baby go???So that has been my Sunday. Shoulders ache from felting and sewing, eyes are scratchy from the wool so I do think I will have a G&T and call it a day.

Due to traffic jam and a crash on the road, it took them five and half hours to arrive at home , taking side roads in a slow bus.While waiting for Cubby to wake up - another couple of blind drawings and smoosh painting. This is , of course, Liz Cheney...uncanny resemblance, snort - delighted with these blind skills....The dumb asses in Wyoming elected a Trumpster through and through with half a brain and the charm of a rattle snake. But there you go. Wyoming is  great for geology and horses but intellect, not so much, Growing up there was training for  dealing with the worst life has to offer...Some of the things that set Wyoming apart from the rest of the universe is the fact that it has the highest gun death rate, highest divorce rate, highest suicide rate, lowest rate  for quality patient care of  occupational injuries, highest rate of fatal occupational injuries -15th  highest for drug overdose mortality. Humans are the dumbest animals in Wyo. But the geology is smart, intriguing.Liz is indeed a carpetbagger and has a voting record of \"NO\", She is not Wyoming, she is too smart number one- she lived in Casper for a short time in sixth grade when her illustrious dad, DICK, was campaigning- and, number two - she wants to make certain that the orange disease does not run again. That got her  well kicked out- Wyoming is so festering red it should be put to sleep. For a moment I thought that if she were to run I might give her my vote, but she is dyed in the wool republican and her voting record should frighten anyone! Still am most grateful for her Jan6th hearings and her adherence to the constitution/ democracy.To get that bad taste out of my mouth, my pencil, my paint- I moved on to a more cheerful event- nude swimming in the bay....Geez, the realism is very nearly like a photograph of high quality! I only have one more page left in this little book of bad paper and worse blind drawing, It has brought much joy to me and my brain/ heart. Stress is a slow burn, this crazy drawing bails me out for five minutes.Cubby still sleeping, I may have to wake him up to piddle before his human comes to collect him. He may be confused, he may be overjoyed- \"Hoomans back to git me\"??? \"Not abandoned\"Wag wag!RAIN!

The dog on the poster is Trooper, a friend's dog. He tells folks to leash their pooches , it's the law, as a woman  passes us , whose dog does not have a leash, but is forgiven because the dog had a foreign accent.  I assume could not read English.Home now, cranked up the air conditioner, washed our faces- did  another draw with eyes shut. I love doing this, what comes out is so not my style of drawing as I usually draw like I sort of know what I am doing (I don't) with these blind paintings there is no doubt. Usually when I draw with eyes open I tend to be  fussy and stiff. I feel young again,  really young- five years old maybe!-0-Baby in the bucket- cooling off. So that is that. No rain today."},

Mary put up a deer fence this summer, it sometimes keeps the deer out, Mary does not appreciate the deer at all! Water is being conserved so , just to keep the dust down, Mary gives the side garden a squirt. Their back garden is on a hillside, the deer leap over the fence and into the garden, make themselves comfy and then can not figure out how to get over the fence from a lower level. Tricky. Cubby's walk takes us by the gallery lawn- the Bamsplat piece is hanging on their outside wall on the porch , this new one replaces it on the lawn. Yes, I like it.Walk to where the shade  keeps us cool. The forest is dry, of course, the creek a trickle, the air lacks the usual humidity that we have learned to breathe . The water feature in the park is cold and splashy. I took Erik and Emily there when they were three years old. Erik was a large child , some bullies thought he might be an easy target. he pretty much was as he was gentle and kind and would never hurt anyone intentionally. Emily tinier than most kids her age, always ready for a scrap- went right up to the bullies faces and shouted at them, \"you leave my friend alone- BE NICE!\" She fixed them! And they behaved...though that admonition from a tiny tot would not impress any rational being. Emily will have a little job outside the home in September , I will go over to mind Flora Jane - Cubby will be back here as well so I will have to take him.He has never seen a one year old child in such close proximity. If it is too much , suppose I could leave him here with  crossword puzzles or something. Or just spray the house with \"Thunder Ease\" calming spray, which tends to put him to sleep. Right, so...eyes closed - Five minutes of  putting the fun in funk -keh.  \" Coy Cubby\" and  insane sunflowers - mighty cheerful.That is the thing about drawing blind- things do reveal a more cheerful side of my pencil.  And the colors just don't care!  A purple/green dog, sure, why not. My darling niece will be getting married next summer- anyway that is the plan. A Mayan wedding! Should be colorful and spiritual-ish. deeply significant-ish. This will be her second marriage, sounds like the one she has been yearning for. The other one was stumbled through during trauma, she was in a fog after her Dad went through some difficult cancer shit, and died, she fell onto a shoulder that appeared to be stable.  Got to stay alive and well for the Mayan wedding !I am already making plans- lose about 180 pounds , buy an embroidered south of the border dress for the event,  stay upright. Goals. ( I lied about the 180 pounds- I won't  lose an ounce - I know me and how I hoard adipose tissue- it is my super power for survival, but I will still buy an embroidered frock)"},

Please. Taken into her garden that looks like wonderland, she cuts a huge bouquet for me and wraps them with brown paper. Her potting shed has everything one could need or want- including brown paper.I hasten Cubby's walk to get the blossoms home in time for a drink of water. Running rather than our usual slow stroll, Cubby semi passes out, but the flowers are safe in a large coffee pot full of cold water just in time! Petals fall, looks like confetti, like a bride may have passed this way.The gardener threw in some dahlias as well.-0-For amusement I close my eyes and draw  another couple of quickies, what comes out of my non effort I find, hilarious. This is Cubby peeing on flowers.This is self portrait walking by hollyhocks.Drawing with eyes closed is the most fun I have had in a while. Especially when life starts taking itself so damned seriously.Snap out of it!  What a city looks like when eyes are shut, using finger as a guide,  photo realism... oh yes, indeed.  Cubby's not sure.Peg , also , not sure.  NOT art by definition, try it, it's fun. Just draw a circle eyes shut or posies, you may have a great time with that. The raccoons do have an expressive flair as well. Mud painting is their fave!"},

We continue our walk and take a different trail this time, changing things up a bit.  New sniffs. The trail sign asks that we brush off our shoes so that invasive seeds are not encouraged to ride along.  It is a shady path. A cool walk.We meet Claire the rescue pooch  riding in a pram. She was a puppy mill mama, toy/pocket sized Shih tzu, tiny- every time she had puppies it had to be cesarean because this breed does not have the muscle strength to push out a litter. Anyway, she was rescued from a trailer in the Tri City desolate desert from poor people trying to make a buck on puppy sales.

Flowers - sunrise on the deck. the color is snappy in the sun!Heat is over, the days are perfect.There may be rain soon. and you just know that when the rain comes it is reluctant to leave! These , right now, are rare  perfect days. My dreams are technicolor.Two volunteers popped up. Cubby will be here for another four days.His folks will be going to France for three weeks a few days after they come home from Rhode Is. Long enough to tie up some loose ends and pack, I will have Cubby again while they frolic in France.He has settled in so well. Likes it here , the many walks , the delicious home made food. He is no fool.Deck flowers are screaming with color right now! When the sun slants, they pop! The red colors, eeeek - my camera  does not quite know what to do with the reds, I have to tone them down a bit when I load them . Like this for instance:Toned down! Still fierce!Speaking of fierce- we watched \"Dropout\"  on HULU , over two nights. The story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. Whoa! Manipulative genius , that girl! Still getting away with too much as her lover, Sunny,  takes the heat for most of it.

They came down from Valdez Alaska to the mountain wedding. They all stayed in a large cabin/lodge for three days. You remember Exxon Valdez , the 2 billion dollar clean up of crude in Prince William sound, still not clean.  Only four people died from the spill , not from the direct crash but from clean up- do not volunteer for  clean-up committee- it will kill you. The tourist brochures are lovely though. And the family was Alaskan, in that they are quiet, non talkers really. I am a non talker so good that there were folks there who LOVE to talk.So, that's Maddie off being a Mrs. Her plan is to continue with flight training/ pilot stuff, just in time for no petrol to propel the flying machines. The fourth walk- Cubby takes me to the park where the creek is a trickle, the trails are dust.The fish ladder is not much good either.We bump into a girl I knew when she was about eight years old - all grown up now with a darling two year old in tow.She recognized my voice, not this old meat bag I am riding around in. The kid's are alright! Most all of Erik's childhood friends have become amazing adults, more than a few have died along the way- too young. Drugs'll do that. Dammit.Hypericaeae blooming. Every year I am amazed at this plant growing wildly , abundantly. Such happy flowers- they do look like a celebration. Ok, then, I am off again to , can you guess...empty the dog.Oh, and Dennis's heart is A fibbing again...

I gathered another bouquet for Dennis- he does love flowers! I mentioned that Cubby managed to get perfumed in the toilet yard...This morning I gave him a bath- Dennis likes my apron and reckoned that it was Cubby's baptism. White jesus did indeed dunk the dog in the holy water of Bellingham.Cubby sniffs yet another bouquet  , brought over by the neighbors to wish Dennis well. It must have worked because he bounced back like elastic on pants!  BOING! Good as new, he is!Straw flowers and rosemary from the neighborhood bench o' plenty. \"Please take\"...so I did.Binge watched \"Under The Banner Of Heaven\". I read the non fiction  book in mid 2000 as did many- every reader sickened to the core and I must say, and warn, that the series is horrifying, frustrating, and nauseating. How religion can go so wrong! Yes, the wacko murderers are fundamentalists , but  there is a fine line, a thread separating their notions from the new and improved modern law abiding church.  Strict rules that make no sense whatsoever,  power , total patriarchy of course keep the ball rolling and that is OK , some folks need that sort of thing. Generation after generation after generation after generation. Gratitude for my free thought parents , otherwise I could have fallen into some sort of culty weirdo shit,  I am sure.  some i have nudged looked mighty inviting. Cults  tend to sparkle on the outside, especially during times of stress, disillusionment, depression, hardship, we tend to turn to the hocus pocus of supernatural invention. A coping mechanism. This is a good, brief article on human species being the only animal to invent gods, how that tendency is wired into our brains. An estimated 18,000 gods have been invented , animal and sun worship- but  organized Mormons, Scientologists and Christians and Jews have taken it all to another level of bizarre. They can't help it, It is their world no matter how nonsensical . Rules , ceremony,  tightly control and keep them from straying from their culture. Fear of  Supernatural punishment keeps  entire (contrived) history and families hinges at the fore.   Human is  cray cray animal!

This is Figaro -  travels the length of his fence in a protective manner, warning Cubby to stay a foot away or else...or else what? Figaro is all bark and Cubby is deaf - takes no notice and then they touch noses and wag. It's a dog thing. This house on wheels was on the street for years,  it has found a more permanent place, surrounded by trees with its own stone path.Cubby's mission is  to pee on Santa. All the dogs do it-  maybe a contest is going on but I will tell you , that Santa does not smell like Christmas.  There is a new bit of art in the neighbor's yard, clever, dollar store pin wheels, drilled into a wooden ball rotating and dazzling atop a 20' pole. It may not last through the winter especially if the wind has it's way, but it is a delightful momentary  addition.The grass is tall, the dog is short, coming home with  seeds and stickies in his coat. Just being a dog, \"morning constitutional\" before bedtime, he rolled in the wild animal toilet that is our yard.  It was late so I did not bathe him. I am sorry- as he sleeps on my head and my head is where my nose lives.  Honda, endorsed by  Jesus apparently.  Road delineation. Trees segregate as we walk between them.

Gargle bleach.Waiting in one waiting area, then another area,  finally the  nice one upstairs same floor as where the  prep and surgeries are done. Takes all day just to get to the real room. Stayed with Dennis after prep for about twenty minutes,  came home to wait because Dog can not be left for long. Kept tabs on the hospital tracking info - computer. The computer finally  said to come and get him at 5:30 pm- and then the phone rang. Nope.  Now the tracking says - tomorrow , noonish.  He coughed and blew out the plugs in the groin where they went in to mar his heart. OK, that is good! Glad it did not happen at home. Jesus- I 'm no nurse- keep him there until he has healed completely, please! The bill, my lord! Getting the stents and a night in hospital was the cost of a house in a good neighborhood on the sunny side of the street! Healthcare- WOW! Went out to empty Cubby and  to gather some flowers for Dennis. Changed the sheets, bought some lemon  yogurt and gentle things for  to eat tomorrow after I  pick him up around noon. Don't you just love how the medical pros  play down  procedures- like it is  a walk in the park...rarely do they tell you how unpleasant it all is and how incredibly creepy . Then send you home same day with a Tylenol. Recovery will be  another walk in the park, they reckon.

Because i used Amy's organic split pea soup instead of from scratch- must have put Cubby off.  He said \" MEH\" and \"No thank you\" to my attempt. I found that if I wash the split pea soup out of this concoction he will eat it but not joyfully!Came back to our house surrounded by wild life and singing birds and OMG I think Abby is right in her comparison that this place is like Snow White's digs. The lad drove up from Portland for a brief week end that went by too quickly. He was amazed to wake up in the morning to see deer and rabbits and raccoons staring at him through his window. Taking a morning stroll across the street to the neighbor's Gunnera Manicata, which sounds like something good to eat but it is not. The leaves are harsh, the stems thick and full of thorns. The deer do not like them, great barrier plant to keep gardens from being consumed.  Driving all that way for a quick two nights and driving all that way back again! We try to make it worth his while, Dennis took him to Cost Co where all needs were met. ( his bumper sticker)We had massive BBQ.Having a dog in the house was perfect for both Cubby and Erik, Cubby is in love with him. Last night we went out for dinner at the harbor, left the dog to guard the castle. On the menu, top left hand corner was a \"Small Plate's\" menu, I read it  out loud and said \"only small plates\" Erik thought I meant to only order from small cheap menu...Being a financially strapped guy living in a houseful of other poor youngins' , he thought it was a reasonable request and ordered from small plates! NO! I said \"change your order! I was just READING!!\"  He did not change his order, just rolls with it ...and is grateful  and happy about going out for dinner no matter what. he is a champion in his angel devil babies shirt, eating from small plates while his parents had the real deal! Terrible parents.He took on a second job, working at weddings and celebrations with a photo booth company , these are his \"tests\" to see if it was set up correctly. That job did not last because the damned photo booth kept breaking down, at least he was paid well for as long as it lasted and he participated in the wedding's over the top food! One was a combo Mexican/ Philippine wedding with immense tables of the best food ever, happy sharing festive folks, welcoming Erik into their celebration!  His Mud Shark job is going well, got a raise though never enough, you know how that goes, trying to keep up with rents and inflation. It is hard work and hot very hot, Portland tempts up into the hundreds and a workplace full of firing kilns, he walks to and from work every day- 3 miles in the glaring sun...and that is a gramps story he may tell to his non existent grand kids.

Teachers are like that, always pushing for betterment. From long long ago- articulated  Barbarian, the only guest- an envelope full of interchangeable limbs and head for many expressions, depending on the mood...One of the best Christmas cards ever received.

Tried to be a raccoon, sort of succeeded, though the real ones just stared blankly at it. No recognition whatsoever. Thoroughly enjoying this new pastime of drawing with eyes shut.  Quick and funny and takes my mind off of more pressing issues. I highly recommend this activity  especially if more weighty things are getting in the way of frivolity.  Sun on the deck.

Cubby did not even wake up for the birthday song. He is still very interested in playing with the varmints on the deck, they are somewhat interested in him. \"Varmints\" is a funny word. Troublesome animals have nothing to do with MINT but there you go, English is such a peculiar language.  I would hate to  have to learn it...I bought this little booklet of drawing paper because the illustration on the front was curious .I can not figure out what the kid has in his pocket and why the other children are so amused by it. Fresca had a post about her friend drawing with eyes shut. I decided to use this little booklet for that reason - drawing with eyes shut is hilarious. Breaks patterns of precision, judgement and leads one into another world of expression.  This is A self portrait of me and Cubby, hilarious and surprisingly accurate. Cubby shares a birthday with the little girl next door.

Yesterday  a fawn leapt  from the rhodies- two inches from us - They do not look very big from afar but , believe me they can pack a whollop.  Cubby and I both fell back, off balance. Hmmm, another art work- framed but unfinished, or is it????Went to the grocery store to get emergency Bubbie's  bread and butter pickles - grocery store flowers are cheap  now, too. Why does anyone buy flowers in a summertime full of flowers? There is just no explaining some people, but there you go. I bought grocery store flowers- they are not brilliant but the orchids are, This one is Janet's. They are only 20 bucks for a huge plant.

Tumor on the head and Look at his hoof! His leg is going the wrong way, too. I left some fresh chard by him but it frightened him away. Good intentions are not always successful. Game and fish and humane society do not gather injured deer readily- Unless it is injured dead. The little raccoon looks well enough. Playing with Mama's tail and doing the rolly polly baby raccoon thing.  Cubby and I went out into the yard, no walks today because he is feeling punk and it is too hot. This collection is from our yard stroll and poo, and poo some more, and then another poo.Predictable , no? And not very clever. I put the jay feather in my jay jar so it missed the face  photo opp.  Worried about Cubby, I know that he does this sometimes. Shih tzus have fragile digestive systems. I gave him two inches of hamburger  last night- that is probably what did it. Anyway, he is refusing to drink water and that is my main worry.  Maybe if I give him a bath the water will soak into the dog ?  Logic....Post script:genius, it totally worked- he is back among the living and he ate his dinner and had veg broth! Walk at the end of the day- the sun was hotter than we are accustomed to and I forgot to take water for the dog. The ditches are dry, Cubby managed to water the poppies along the way but then he ran out, because of my oversight , bad human.He walked at a pretty good clip  for about six of what ever sections of house and land are called. He read the sign and did what it told him to do, grateful for the order.  Walked for a few yards , plopped down again,  waited, cooling off. another few feet, plop, wait. this did take up a good bit of time.Again.... and again, plop, wait.A very large bee  stumbling along in the grass, Cubby watched with  interest but I convinced him that the bee was too spicy to eat.Wandered about , trees, mail box posts, doing the dog sniffs, trying to leave drops, then he was truly done. Hot for us but not for most of you, I am sure. 84 degrees.A notice on the neighborhood board looks promising! Home now, gallons of water and ice cream. This is the first ice cream I have had in this house for years, since Dennis's diabetes- you know- solidarity with the afflicted, anyway, plain vanilla bean with Fran's caramel- I had forgotten how satisfying ice cream is on a hot day.When Dennis returns I will have ballooned .  I must eat all of it - destroy  evidence- taking an ice cream hit for the team. Ice cream was his favorite and he is sad enough without delicious used to be's staring him in the face.We had turned the air conditioner off, thinking that we would never need it. Also  it leaks and floods the basement. Out of consideration for the Mechanical co. , which \"surely must be booked and way too busy\", Dennis was reluctant to   call them .  I phoned them today-  they will be here  tomorrow morning and the thing will be a non issue.  Just like *snap* that! Overthinking  is sometimes misplaced- this is that !  Get things done , especially if there is no one around to order us to not do the things!

He has given away all of his petrol propelled mowers, power washer, trimmers, doo dahs,  and replaced them with electric, It is so much nicer- quieter, better for the environment- or so we are told.  Beautiful compost, I would have taken some seeds had I not had the dog with me. No time for dilly dallying around when there are smells to be smelled, grass to chew, fenced backyard dogs to get acquainted with.

Flourishing right now, berries, beans, flowers, sweet peas, squash- people rent a 13' x 15' plot to do what ever they like with the garden, raised beds , fenced and protected.There is a tool shed, a community wagon, and an out building to use. The waiting list is over two years long now, especially since Covid, the little plots are at a premium!The  family way in the back has the prettiest garden with trellises and a sweet arbor gate. Well organized- the little boy gave me a prize ruby raspberry , the mom gave me three beans, so proud of their miracle garden.On the way back we met another dog , you may be able to see him - paws up on the gate, face obscured by a large hydrangea blossom.Dog walks are the best- the  wagging happiest.As I was making dinner the doorbell rang three times- which meant \"URGENT\".Two little girls who live next door, stood with a bouquet of flowers that they had gathered . They did not speak, they rarely do, but their Granny was at the bottom of the stairs explaining that the girls wanted to give flowers to Dennis and Linda- Dennis is on the island for a week and I am sure that the girls were disappointed- he is their favorite.

We are not sentimental.That was today, the topping, besides being married for longer than most people have been alive, was the Jan6th hearing.  We can breathe again, I mean take a full deep breath- truth will out...eventually, they say and looks like maybe this is a happening deal...Brilliant! The closing statements - OH MAN!!  Not sure whether to scream AMEN or weep for gratitude, or send Liz Cheney an Atta Girl, maybe all of those things! The Orange pickle certainly is getting spanked, oh yes.A very good day!"},

Curious little blossoms, tiny yellow dots on the hem of  her skirt.This morning before Dennis had a chance to have sex with the zucchini flowers, I took this photo. Came in , looked up Zucchini blossoms , asking if sex with them is an OK thing to do. The answer is, \"yes\" ...But  some are male and some are female, this one is male. So if you diddle them with a sable brush, they will close,while you are all confident in your sexual prowess, they really did not have a good time and will not produce fruit because, males do not. It is advised to remove the male flower , take the petals off ,  use the stamen and poke the female right in her ovary.  I was too late with that information so Dennis had gay sex with this blossom. Nothing will come of it, no fruit, no lasting relationship, no threat to our marriage, which, by the way - in a couple of days will be 37 years legally, add four more for \"shacking up.\" ( my father's term)  41 years , Holy Mother Mary, baby Jesus and all of the little lambs !!  HOW????Vanilla fudge with gold flakes , a  mango macaron  (look at their PHOTOS) and  a rainbow \"thank you\" note from the shower girl. Dennis delivered the gift  to the party and promptly excused himself to go with sons into town for lunch. Staying safe from those unmasked girlie girls with their giggly ways. He stayed safe from any virus that may have attended the party. The wedding will be on top of the mountain in August. I asked if it was to be forest flannel or forest formal. It is to be the latter so now I am wondering WTF to wear??? And whether or not I should pack a cot in case Dennis feels weak, His ablation is two days  before the mountain top wedding. The mountain is a live volcano, would be a shame if it blew while we are all celebrating  Maddie and her desire to spend eternity with Kiefer. ( Dennis calls him \"Yogurt\")That would be a quick marriage!-0-This little rascal , in the yard this morning. They do look more like rats than fluffy squirrels and seem to be much more aggressive / wild. Color on the deck will put your eye out! When the sun finally comes around , it screams! The air is so clear everything seems over the top in its exuberance, detail, aggressive color!Finally, a close up  of the ginkgo  leaf that I stuck on the window, it is grand!  Sunday morning is just fine, and there are sausages, yum.How to make macaron"},

Lavender is nearly finished in our yard, bees are hanging out on the cat mint,  at least they have something to gather, to pollinate, to keep them busy and alive.Another painting on the lawn gallery. Morris Graves influence I find appealing. This morning in orphan world, Checking every one's teeth, monitoring hygiene . Reminders can be helpful, all are keeping their promises to brush and floss and not eat sweets.Cat would not budge, as cats rarely do, checking  cat mouth hygiene  is not something the orphans want to  endanger themselves with and so, they took turns riding the cat instead. Wise decision as cats have razor teeth and are not generally cooperative. The cat assured them that her teeth were just fine, so go away.I am not going to the wedding shower today- too much covid and weird ailments floating around , nailing everyone withing breathing distance. Young folks tend to think that they are immune and become less anal about mask wearing and distancing.  Since Dennis is having a heart procedure in a month I am not going to be the one to give him some deadly virus for the sake of a party and kill him dead. NOPE, it is like me driving the new EV, I won't,  don't want to be the one who puts a dent in it , or totals it, I would feel too awful, not a good feeling.

Not to mention the good company on the deck.It took ten minutes for the squash blossom to curl after having had sex with Dennis. I am not sure what to think.Thyme , from last year, looking a little bit worse for wear but still blossoming. There is loads of it- How often is thyme used in this house? Maybe twice a year.The ladies are giving it some thought- Thyme  has been said to aid in the recovery of patchy hair loss. \"Yes,\" the ladies think, \"we shall make an elixir, our hair is gone.\" Plus thyme is good for sleep- \"We shall sleep while our hair is growing, we'll wake up with loads \". I ordered a cautionary coloring book for Dennis's friend who used to work in Yellowstone.  Pages of tourists being stupid or dead from doing things in Yellowstone that one can only shake one's head at. When we  camped nearby for a few summer months, back in the olden days. We just knew stuff- like do not go wading in the thermals, do not give marshmallows to bears, do not try to put your thumb over the hole of Old Faithful- common sense- stay away from the irascible  buffalo (Bison)  and cranky moose- Stay on the walk way...For years now tourists have clogged Yellowstone and have been utterly dim witted about the obvious. We shrug- nature will sort it. These two pages are my favorites out of the book. All are  pretty good but ....well, you see why I fave these two?A thousand ways to die in Yellowstone!"},

Homeless moved into downtown making it a less desirable place unless you are fond of stabbings.Online is the only option for shopping.The only shop worthwhile is the yarn and wool shop- I did not go in because I know the danger!

The many years of study and discovery that finally lead to the break in the code and real reading of Mayan culture/history. Now the language can be taught to its people , their identity and heritage returned to them along with a wealth of understanding of  the remarkable Maya civilization. It is on Amazon Prime for free. Well worth watching for all sorts of reasons, primarily that of being educational , inspiring, art filled and for the illusion of time. -0-The buttons are ones that I made with my boyfriend when I was in my early twenties. We had fallen branches, we had a saw , sand paper , and oodles of time. My favorite ones were from a lilac bush, purple in the middle, I used those first and have none left. We got so good at making tree buttons that we took them up to the university to sell. We made enough money for a cup of chowder and coffee on a good day. These are the dregs, occasionally I will use one on a felted bag closure. The remainder may get sewn into a book just for memory's sake. They are not the finest as you can see, primitive and rough, I do remember that we pretty much sanded our finger prints off, which could have lead us into a  successful life of crime- we would have gotten away with it I am sure. But, at the time, we were all peace/love and harmony- not wanting to incur any \"bad Karma\" as we understood it to be...Honest and helpful, we were- though ,with the cup of chowder , we did eat all ALL of the soda crackers in the basket and did ask for more. Management was not pleased. I have taken to putting crowns on things in this house, mostly dead things because they hold still and the crown stays where intended. I have run out of crowns , thinking that I could be making more out of the detritus in my craft drawer,  where I found the wooden buttons of yore.  If and when we move from this house it will be like mining treasure. Most of it tiny, stashed in boxes within boxes, easily forgotten and put aside. We have talked about this haven't we? The \"cool stuff\" issue?  The too much of it issue? This morning I watched/listened to this Jon Stewart podcast which is so excellent I am begging you to have a listen. How we got here!

( 40 years) Don't know about you, but I do not have 40 years left on this planet- 15, at best...so I am thinking , in the final years of my fabulous life , do I  choose to ride this murderous bronco, kicking me in the gut every day?  Or do I bail, go on a long  search for unicorns and utopia, get out of this particular horror?  I lean toward the later , of course. Anyway, talk to me after you have watched/listened to the podcast, and tell me what you think, your plans, other than to vote and vote and vote...We are powerless, a long , calculated , time coming. Bruce is America.and this Eff Scotus, strangle in your robes, please.

Optimism died with  loosing Obama Hopey changey and the snubbing of first choice Bernie.-0- This morning , little girl snoozing in the tree, Clearly relaxed, knowing that the dog is gone and that this is her deck now. Her tree. Safe.On we go, there will be kits scampering on the deck soon.Cup of tea this morning and the last of the biscuits, experimenting in covid journal which has become less about covid terror , and more about playing with whatever is near by.  I have some black paint that has dried out- I mixed it with water and tried to stir it in but it is well dried out, I have little hope for it. Experimenting with texture as well, and the gold leaf that I found in a drawer and some desiccated leaves that were in-between pages of the large dictionary, some goppy acrylic paint and a sponge. I found that the reflection of gold leaf can hide messages , only able to be  seen if held a certain way.  Zen thoughts of no thought.-0-On my way to the drug store to not get drugs, dang, not the kind I want, you understand... I stop by Joe's garden to see what's up. It is looking very good in spite of the cold rainy weather. The plants don't seem to mind at all. Green houses help.Why no poppies? Damned laws- that is why. Government makes everyone insane with lack of common sense,  lack of beneficial governing for all,  lack of leaders,  employing a  nazi, white supremacist police force  and then slap us with \"illegal\", you will be tossed into the slammer-  from potential poppy  relief.  Please send Opium, just enough for a pie.

Looked up \"Father's Day\"  ( smash the patriarchy) and discovered that the first father's day was invented in 1910  In Spokane Wa. , by a girl whose father raised  six children as a single parent. She wanted to honor him in church, gave a speech and then everyone jumped on board including , most certainly, Hallmark- and another obligatory holiday was firmly in place, officially established by 1966. Mother's have been single parenting large tribes for centuries thank you!   Mother's Day , one effing day out of the year when maybe she does not have to cook dinner, usurped by the patriarchy. Sperm donor day really does not deserve a corn ball soppy sentimental  card from hallmark or a special day of ties and socks and wallets. They get all the days. Cup of tea and biscuits with Spanish chocolate on the deck while watching a scruffy deer , half -snooze in the sun. Still not warm but not raining. Life is good. I charged out to get something from the drug store but never made it, I was sidetracked by a corner market  selling cherries and berries.FINALLY!! the strawberries took their time this year.I would say well worth the wait, they are so sweet and plump. Cherries have been at the market for about a week, also sweet and delish. Next week there will be Queen Ann and rainier cherries ,as well  as apricots and plums. Vitamin C overload!The market man said, \"want some plants for free- I am tired of watering them, take as many as you want\" . Two pots of garlic, two pots of beans, two pots of tomato, four pots of flowers. They will have to go on the deck to keep the rabbits and deer from eating them.

Morning walk around the block to leave his Charlie messages in his favorite spots. Marine park after breakfast to leave more of the same.We did not go to  more interesting places today, wanted to stay close by, in case. His folks finally arrived three hours late not counting on the long wait at the border. All is well, Charlie is with his humans now back in the big city.He found a sock clinging to the side of  a rock down by the bay. He sniffed but was not interested in taking it with him. He found a rude dumpster, too- \"yo Mama\" Marine park is not the best- it is too well planned and too small, but worthy of leaving a  prized poo . ( of course , I picked it up and put it in the proper receptacle, because that is what we do!) That is one thing I do not miss about dog  ownership and walks, carrying poo bags around until the proper receptacle is found. Ewww, especially when I forget and itch my nose, bag in hand.Walked the usual neighborhood route, saying goodbye to weirdo plants and deer and fawns and peeing on everything that he deemed worthy.  I swear that dog could put out a major fire,  so much water!Above our house  are other houses on the hill - his favorite place to poo and drench, and to look for rabbits  to stare at.We checked out the \"gallery\" on the mystery lawn , to find yet another painting. They seem to be getting through them. Not sure where they go. Questionable art heaven?So , that's Charlie gone- on to the next adventure.  I would love to get out of town for a while,  on my own. The weather is such crap that going anywhere around here just sounds like work. That is why opium poppies would be a nice garden to have about now. Yes, please.Cara brought biscuit and tea from England ,  chocolate and saffron from Spain ,for a thank you- think I will get stuck into the biscuits and tea right now. A bit of comfort while the weather does its most dismal work out there."},

We walked to boulevard Park and  all around the area - good sniffing! A very old madronna tree lives in the park but is not honored, as you can see from all of carvings of human initials.The train runs right through the park and has killed a few folks who do not pay attention or who intentionally  want to die. It happens.Across the park's lawn . the most wonderful fragrance on the breeze , smelled like what heaven would smell like,  if it existed...Found the source finally, Japanese tree lilac, the most lovely flower ever! Just below it hidden , not  well, in the grass- a painted stone left by a child ,  with good wishes to the finder. It's a trend. Behind the coffee house is what used to be a tree, clever way to cut it down, but leave it at the same time. Schrodinger's tree.This town is an uphill town, I don't notice it that much until I am being walked by Charlie. It is one of the reasons I have never had a bike here. Electric bikes are becoming a thing so maybe now I can do that. The hills will not kill me, getting on and off the bike might. Walking home, painting has changed again. The yard is a good place for this one I think. This evening, Charlie insisted on another long walk- we went to Fairhaven park but took trails behind the parky area. Trails I have never taken before. It was good! Tomorrow Charlie is going back home to Seattle. I am not happy and I am happy- Schrodinger's happiness - See you in space!"},

I still do not know what is going on with the fancy easel in the yard and the changing art. Must be a story, a reason,  we need to know. This one is joyful but I am not sure it matches my sofa... I left it. The  fuzzy scrotum  seem to not mind the excessive rain this season. Summer is just not happening as it ought.-0-This morning something caught my interest- it sound utterly absurd. Science trying to sort and control Obesity, beginning with fat embryos. I live with Mr. \"fat shamer\" also one of my oldest friends is a capital  bigoted , rude , condescending, shamer.  I avoid her.. Dennis, I can reckon with , but I have zero patience.  Loathing of fatter folk is toxic - everywhere you look- ads, industries, and now scientists  want to get those  chubby embryos on a tread mill.   I have experienced being treated more nicely when I am thin and that pisses me off because  generally I am overweight and I am the same godamn person in either suit. My great grandmother  was huge, she was Swedish- she was a great cook/baker, ate well and worked hard.  She outlived her  skinny husband, her skinny  children and their skinny children- just sayin'. What is the damned deal with fat shamers??? It is not about health that's for sure. Alongside the article was a link to Health news- I can not find it now but it was something like - new study finds that clinically underweight people have almost twice the risk of death, compared to obese individuals.  The study is out of Toronto, and this is the color chart. Overweight wins!  -0-Anyway, Charlie walked my overweight self  through the hood, along the creek and down through the park. A couple of trees got clipped by winter, looks like, and there was a birthday party going on in spite of the iffy weather.Freezing children.We came home just before the rain had a chance to drown us. Good thing too. I am all walked out. Charlie - Mr. Task Master, has made me desire Advil, loads of it.  His humans come back on Sunday afternoon. Landing in Vancouver after a ten hour flight, drive here,  collect the dog, and on to Seattle. No more testing to get into the country - that is a plus! Just zip through the border like it was the olden days, but , wow what a trip, they are going to be so exhausted. Maybe they will forget Charlie! Town,  soaked again. Forecast is for more of the same, I read that Duluth Minnesota is the place to live to avoid much of the grief of climate change. I am thinking that I will just go down with the ship, thank you.Morning walk to the bay. Curious how the waterfront changes , slowly for years and years and then suddenly, while we were all locked in due to the plague, buildings went up, buildings removed, paths expanded or changed, Parks shrunk, more people moving in. It used to be that the lack of jobs kept folks from moving here, and the weather of course, but now this is an area of desirability. Especially since folks know how to work from home and don rain gear. Seems to be the trend and I do think it might be  a good one. Fewer cars on the road getting to the office . Less gas being used. Of course in a big wind or when a satellite falls out of the sky , computers crash and - no more work for the day. We are slaves to this tech, no doubt.  Evening walk- walked the inner urban trail, met one other person, quiet , birds singing , lovely walk.Though there is a maintained  trail , it is still pretty wild and one must be alert for deer, cougar and coyotes and any human maniac that may have found his way to the inner urban network. We started the hike up to Hoag's Pond, but I was not prepared, I was wearing the wrong shoes, losing grip and sliding downhill, there are also many exposed roots to trip you up if your foot gear is stupid. I rarely know where Charlie is going to take us, I should never wear stupid shoes. Always be prepared- the motto for the PNW!Another loved  mail box on the way home."},

The park was twice the size it is now when Dexter , Cubby and Winslow used to take me there. The poop plant had to expand, so can't complain really. Clean water is paramount. \"Is tap water safe to drink in Bellingham?Bellingham's water is safe to drink and it's also economical. The average cost for a gallon of bottled water from a store is $1.50 and the average cost for a gallon of safe tap water is $0.005. That means bottled water costs 375 times more than the safe water coming from your tap.\" so, there you go.

Sweltering.There will be more digging around in the dirt of Jan 6- undeniable findings ,of course, what we all knew but have been   gas lit about. Never thought I would champion Liz Cheney , but ...Awesome job,  carpetbagger Liz! Of course her political career is likely  shot but, she has a nice pocket of change to retire on. $ 86 million from Daddy's Halliburton hi-jinx. That ought to be  enough to get her through the winter.  I went to the Euro shop to get rye bread, the BEST rye bread ever!  Huge loaf for a hefty price but worth it, while there I also bought a bag full of carb- bombs. Russian Prianik ginger bread- why is Russia in the Euro shop?  And why did I buy anything from Russia- technically they are made in California so, I am off the hook, I guess. Nothing like the satisfying mouthful of  massive carb  ginger heaven! Leaving you with this fabulous chair! It was in the Palm Springs condo.I asked Michael about it, he and his husband are there now roasting - it is 104 degrees!

While the bedding is being sloshed around in the machine , Charlie tries to get his bearings. He is OK, the seizure not nearly as dramatic as Dexter's were. After some meds and CBD, I don my winter coat and off we go for a woozy walk.  Color is popping out everywhere in spite of the cool weather. I am especially loving the delicate pink of Peony and poppy.  Looks wedding-ish and kiss-ish. Two lovely things in this life.  I mean...they can be....maybe, not always. The reflection from the fancy mailbox is how Charlie is  probably feeling this morning.  Steady enough but confused, I allow him to guide me where ever he wants to go. Sometimes we walk backwards.Smelly daisies are beginning to appear. Do not be fooled, \"Fresh as a daisy \" does not apply to Shasta's.Fox gloves are always impressive, five feet tall, some taller.French Lavender  seems more wild- I had some at the top of the rock wall , sent to me from Leenie, I loved it. Dennis tore it out thinking it was a weed, I guess...destructive gardener (?) One of our Rhodies died this winter , surrounded like a shimira  by toad flax, the real weed of the day!

The neighborhood has been taken over by toad flax, that is what it does.Buds on the laurel  bushes in-between our yard and  the other, about to bloom. I love these bushes. They have grown from tiny little shrubs a few years ago to substantial four footers, softening the edge of the yard. After Dennis  had removed all of the trees, our yard had no delineation from the other and no sense of privacy. Finally the bushes have grown well enough to provide a soft barrier and a catcher of errant balls from the children. The other day Mr. Man said he wanted them gone. He is afraid of them. \"They will grow too much\"...Day of the triffids comes to mind...On we go, wobbly dog , not riding along with me to the eye doctor to see if I can see."},

Pickle ball players  were just arriving for early morning set up. We watched for a while ,  fun , until they  became fiercely  competitive, then it just looked like a fast & furious  way to break a bone. -Where's Charlie? The rhodies !! - Erik used to climb up into them  when he was a little kid- it was gorgeous - like fairy land! the branches are substantial twisty playland. Charlie thought the labyrinth walk was dumb- what is the point,  dunno, but the center is cool and the stones  have meaning. Stuff like - \"healing, energy, love, clarity, behave, cosmos, fish, blah blah\". We walked around to the other side of the fish ladder , and  down the overflowing creek, Charlie gathered canine info  and left some as well. How can such a little dog be so full of water is what I want to know.We walked some more, then drove  up to the side of the hill that overlooks  the sound- in the distance 40 miles away  the evidence  of refineries , outside of  Anacortes ,puff away- like oil is going to last forever and is a good thing.  It's not. In the afternoon we walked through the neighborhood  yet again, avoiding the doe with twins, avoiding the q-anoners , and avoiding  way too many rabbits! The babies scoot fast - look like hamburger buns scurrying into the bush, all round and soft and brown and edible. Disappointingly , the dog wood does not smell like dogs. And the Thrift blossoms have nothing to do with finding a bargain.( the plant\"thrift\")Home again, listening to an interview with Janis Ian on NPR. Moved me to deep thoughts, moved me to rage. Her new album is worthy to be sure and the lyrics to\"Resist\" knocked me dead!  And , I swear every time I hear \"Society's Child\" my throat closes and the tears roll. At least that has changed pretty much, maybe, hasn't it?...Please tell me it has. Janis Ian has certainly championed our lives, telling it like it is with her dulcet  singing voice and scorching lyrics. The BLM signs are  important , NOT moving on until realized, staying vigilant until melanated  are treated with dignity and compassion and the so called police are magically turned  to be  caring intelligent  human beings. Tall order, folks, tall order! We are up for it, Carry on!  The painting is still in the yard- In the rain and through the night.Rain is not the best weather condition for paintings but maybe that is the intent- part of an artistic process? Looks like nothing has changed with its appearance so far. That was our Sunday- tomorrow more rain on the menu- 51 degrees.Charlie is not keen.  Walking Charlie a different route, due to Doe aggressively protecting her twins, wanting to avoid any stress for her,  and any attack on dog, we walk up by the school and around the back, across the street.A Painting on a very nice easel by the side of the road.   Why? I am not sure...but it did give us pause. and maybe that was the point. Pretty sure it was NOT for the taking.It was a nice little surprise- how it did not get nicked is beyond me - we do live in a fairly rational neighborhood, so...there it stayed. Car thefts have gone up and of course bicycle theft. Tweekers steal bikes, refurbish them so that they are not recognizable, sell them to buy more meth. That is the cycle of the bicycle in this town. It is an industry! The morning is another lovely one. We come home- have a cuppa and a crumpet with cream cheese and apricot preserve, Charlie has his smelly breakfast of what ever it is. So gross! A pill in a yummy pill pocket, CBD oil on a spoon and the day is set.This is our last packet of coffee- the price has gone way up , our favorite brand! I will buy more when this runs out, I must!! I have been drinking coffee since second grade and am not about to stop now. Besides, I looked it up on trustworthy medical sites- Coffee is full of antioxidants and is very good for preventing cancer, and other illnesses.   It is the bean not the caffeine, which is also beneficial, but not as an antioxidant. The bean, the roast, the process of making the cuppa has been determined to be healthfood. I am on board! And now the usual gray skies have moved in full of rain. The temperature is in the low 50's.

There were biscuits for the dog , so that got a paws up from the pooch. The park is becoming more active , when the sun comes out  it is like another world! Threat of rain always around the corner! We  sometimes remember to dress for it. Sometimes too drunk on sunshine to second guess and are caught in a downpour without a hood. You might notice that I did not say \"umbrella\" - people in the northwest do not carry them usually. We have other gear , who ever heard of climbing hills and going through wild forests with an umbrella- nope, they are for  the city . Baby blue heron  did not make it, who knows what happened - it is quite a shame. Blue herons are protected. Maybe an eagle ? Though you would think an eagle would have devoured the bird. Heron nests are very high at the top of the trees , maybe the baby fell or was pushed out by more aggressive birds. We will never know. I did have to get a closer look at it and turn it over in my hand examining it- curious that way. I rested it in a soft bush and said \"sorry\".After the failed breakfast we move on up the hill - weather changes a little, the clouds roll in.This grampa  cloud may be the spirit of the Grandfather tree that got murdered yesterday, a very old man, established well before people from California came to threaten  environment, imposing their stupid \"tidy\" values on this wild place.The stump is not Grampa- it is another tree that they murdered at the same time, The largest stump behind where you can not see is Gramp's. I stood in the street with another nieghbor and we  wept to see this. People bought the house, they are from California - golf courses and the taming of nature to their liking is their way to live, I guess. We will never forgive them, plus they are waving the american flag on the side of their house which, of course, gives you an idea of who they are.  Grandfather tree was the oldest and largest  in the neighborhood. A grand old gentleman now firewood for the murder's son. Geez, stay in  southern California y'all.  A long and very good morning walk, cool enough but no jacket wearing  required.

On top of grappling with teen-age angst and fighting death-defying battles, this inseparable bunch also ran an illegal gambling ring out back, behind Honeydukes sweetshop. Students would place bets on whether the angry, bald Linda could wrap her entire mouth around a grapefruit, and Linda would always, without exception, fail, and then fall asleep for hours. As Linda distracted too much from the main thrust of the series, her short stint in the friend group came to an end, along with Ron’s original catchphrase: “Linda is going to absolutely ruin our lives.”- from the New Yorker humor section today. Charlie finds shrooms in the yard. There were also two tiny fawns hidden - one was so well hidden  that Charlie nearly fell over it, It bolted - we went the opposite direction.

Charlie has had three walks today, My legs are feeling all this walking , Charlie can never have enough. He is a funny guy- He sits like this frequently when he wants to get noticed, when his needs have not quite been met. This morning at 6:00 he was  standing on my bed .... just like this staring at me with his \"people eyes\" waiting for me to make breakfast. He is practicing being a human child, and it is working. The horse tail , along the sidewalk, is abundant everywhere- it goes way back to the beginning of time so - here to stay. The bamboo needs to be harnessed. It has escaped the garden where they were planted on purpose- why would anyone do that? I will tell you. The plants were small and pretty around the little pond in the garden initially- the people moved, sold their house to folks who had no idea that Pandas do not live here, consequently there is no one to eat  invasive bamboo- you can watch it grow in a day, and spread. Without pandas , it has no reason to be. Neighbors with yard art- the leaves and cat tails in the stump are glass on metal rods. even the little birds on the bridge are \"art\" rather than real.The large wooden salmon is looking  more like a sock puppet these days- bleached out by weather . a fly under a leaf in the sun.The fawn was gone for a few days - he is back now , waiting for Mama. He has grown, no longer a mouthful. Such a patient baby. I went to Trader Joe's in the morning , bought all sorts of good things including sunflowers. The little water color was done by Leenie some years back. This is her ETSY shop, you may find something you must have, especially since father's day is around the corner. Father's day,  copy cat holiday. Anyway, Trader Joe is cheaper and better quality  than our neighborhood grocery store, is cheaper than the COOP and most certainly better than Wholefoods. I bought cauliflower pizza \"dough\" zero carbs for Dennis to have  fake pizza, nice change from his usual. Produce is fresh and the flowers are  vibrant.  Trader Joe is my friend  at the moment! I went to Janet's briefly, to deliver something and say \"hi, I love you\" She was on her way to lift weights at the senior center. From her house,  Charlie took me for yet another walk to mud bay and around the village.  Queen Anne's  lace is growing  around the edges of the marsh, right on time! Next will be pearly everlasting and Shasta stinky daisies. Must be summer. That is the rumor.  Leaving you with cuteness.Can not hide well anymore."},

The bees are finding their way around in spite of it all. What a spring - already summer? Could have fooled me. People do try, These neighbors thought it a good idea to paint old frames and make a garden feature out of them.  Success? I am not sure, They look like a yard sale is going on. That is why I stopped.Juniper berries plumper and more plentiful than ever. Good for making plump gin.Across the street the Japanese Maple is hooked up with an ordinary maple and they have bonded.  This is the leaf of the Gunnera manicata- not even the largest one on this particular plant, just the one that I could reach.An ant.Out the back this afternoon. Baby animals and a pretty mom. In an email from oldest son today,  water color he painted of his dog.Accurate, realism! Exactly -like a photo, you be the judge.Charlie got four walks today because the sun was out. Lovely walks, makes us  glad. This is Charlie being glad. Looks deceive, they say. Trust me, he really is very happy- Walking Spanish down the hall...he's a cool dude, why Charlie made me think of Tom, I am not sure, his confidence maybe, and walking Spanish sounds confident. I never knew what the song was about until now. So I probably should not have used it to describe Charlies attitude. No one is going to execute this pooch!Tom Waits is genius-maybe an acquired taste but an addiction once bit. Spanish down the hall lyrics nicked from you-tube if you are interested.

Since most of the song is about execution, the lines with ambiguous meanings have the version where execution is the focus.He's got himself a homemade special       (he's has a makeshift gun, helping signify that's he's in prison)You know his glass is full of sand       (he's young)it feels just like a jaybirdthe way it fits into his hand       (the prison made gun feels that way, jaybird means penis)he rolled a blade up in his trick towel       (he's sneaking a knife with him)they slap their hands against the wall       (the inmates are making a bunch of noise)you never trip you never stumble       (because you're being escorted, even if you flail, you won't slow your walk)he's walking spanish down the hall       (he's about to be executed)Slip him a picture of our Jesus       (last rights)or give him a spoon to dig a hole      (it won't help him)What all he done aint no ones business      (he's not gonna confess his sins)But he'll need blankets for the cold      (snarky remark about the fact that he'll be dead)they dim the lights over on broadway      (the power drawn from the electric chair dims the lights all around)Even the king has bowed his head      (Multiple meanings, one may refer to the way kings had to signal executioners, and certain officials now do the same)Every face looks right up at Mason      (everyone looks at him)he's walking spanish down the hall      (he's about to be executed)The last four lines of this verse extend the same cocky attitude from the first four like the world is stopping all for him.Latella's screeching for a blind pig      (Thick slang. A cop [pig] has no evidence [blind], but is grilling a guy really hard [screeching])Punk Sander's carved it out of wood      (maybe it refers to the chair itself, maybe it refers to the way the guy is so tough. I can't find any slang related to this. Most likely for tone.)He never sang when he got hoodwinked      (he never snitched while in custody)they tried it all but he never would      (they tried to break him)Tomorrow morning there'll be laundry      (life will go on. They'll have to clean his clothes)he'll be somewhere else to hear the call     (he'll be dead)Don't say goodbye, he's just leaving early      (we all die, he's just dying sooner)He's walking spanish down the hall      (he's about to be executed)The sax duet sounds just like electricity firing about during an execution.All St. Barthalomew said was whisperedinto the ear of Blind Jack Dawes      (St Barthalomew was executed, vague implications about Jack Dawes fate)all Baker told the machine      (lie detector)was that he never broke the law      (never snitched about anything, and wasn't deserving of his fate)Go on and tip your hat up to the Pilate      (refers to Pontius Pilate, reluctant executioner of Jesus)Take off your watch, your rings, and all      (can't wear metal during an electric chair execution. It connects to the way Jesus was stripped and his things were gambled, and it plays off the reverence one has for a Pilot, continuing the play on words.)Even Jesus wanted a little more time      (Jesus prayed that God spare him from his execution) He's walking spanish down the hall      (he was about to get executed)"},

Charlie is a great walker and I will improve! I must if I want to keep up.I took Charlie  along the route that Dexter and I used to walk. It is a long walk up the hill through neighbor's yards, down the hill to the wild. The neighbor's clematis and her Gunnera Manicata blossom, looking like dinosaur food.   The leaves grow larger daily, I could wrap two Charlies in just one of them. They are twice the size that they were yesterday. Buttercups are dotting all of the yards. Dandelions sparse this year.  We walked  to the dog park and poop plant- the heron nests, and through massive wild rose bushes that have loved all of the rain and dark cool days. a perfect temperature, light jacket weather. Walls of roses!We walked the inner urban trails, through the forests  and along the creek that is going wild with delight- so much rain! There was a doe and a new born still wet from birth. Charlie is a good dog, does not go nuts when he sees other animals...except squirrel , something about squirrels...although, this morning a raccoon caught him by surprise and he did tell it to back off. On our way back, through the neighborhood- The nicest mail box ever! Glass mosaic \"Love Letters\".In its own little house protecting it from weather and any base ball bat that may fly by- the glass remains shiny. Without a doubt- the prettiest mail box on the street!Charlie did not chase the rabbit, good boy! Nothing like a good dog walk to shake the lethargy of the past couple of years-it is so beautiful here at the moment. We caught the roses just right, they do not last long. you have to be quick- Before  they morph into  chubby hips , excellent to gather for tea- just be aware of the fibers inside the hip- like fiber glass!

Wool makes the nicest coats for bears. The paws are velvet and the bear looks plumper than any bear  ought to be this time of year.However, when I got the bear home and inspected it further... uh oh.                                                         Nothing that needle and thread won't fix -  delicate surgery! Bear does not seem bothered but all who look at bear are! They say things like \"RUDE\" , and \"OH DEAR\"! \"Terrible\"!!I wonder if the previous owner might have been looking for a baby bear in there . That  very plump round belly has to account for something. Then I thought that maybe this bear had been  a keeper of  someone's stash.  Innocent looking accomplice...-0-Charlie arrived in the afternoon. Dennis pranked  pooch right away getting off to a great start. Charlie loves Dennis already.He is not too sure about  raccoons. He barks at them but they take no notice, so he just stares.... The raccoons get on with their business. No drama. Charlie is a mellow dog, could be due to CBD which he loves to slurp off of the spoon. Charlie has special food that smells worse than death poop vomit and rotting socks. Not even kidding. When I prepare his dinner,  I gag. It is so gross and he gobbles it like a hungry shark. He has settled in quickly- we went for a couple of walks , one long , one short , and he loves sitting on the deck. All is well with the pooch. Emily has been very ill- went to ER last night with a 105 temp following two days of 104 temp. ER is never a good idea if it can be avoided but Emily ,  hippie child,  uses alternative medical team so there was no chance of  calling a physician. ER sent her home with advice to alternate Advil and Tylenol and  to drink loads of fluids.  Nothing else...Little wonder she has more faith in alternatives. Plus a visit to the ER is so expensive!! Health care in this country , well, you know. I need not rant. I will check on her later in the day but will do so from afar! She is pretty sick! Covid kicks hard."},

He has epilepsy so that is another concern. Seizures are scary and can be messy. At the end of life our Dexter had a few - I know what to expect and what to do but still- not at all pleasant.

First born.  Out the front door this morning. Raining all day so far . A no fooling around rain, I might add! Splashing on the deck, breeze coming up- weather! No picnics today.This is our walkway.No shortage of water up here, not yet. The influx of people coming up from the drought can be felt , traffic becoming unreal, rents skyrocketing, and the price of buying a house you can well forget! Millions of dollars for not so great average nothing homes.  Water is the thing, and cool temperatures , as the earth bakes, makes this area desirable at the moment. Just waiting for the oceanic lithosphere to recycle into the Earth's mantle and the volcanoes surrounding us to spew. Just when you think you are luckier than most, BOOM, the earth shakes you off anyway. I have read that during climate change The northern middle part of England will be the best place to be, due to ocean rise and temperatures. No volcanoes on that little island and rarely an earth quake, it seems to have settled into being itself. Remember when we thought the silver jubilee was a big deal? I can not imagine a world without Queen Elizabeth- she has always been with us, well before we were even born- steady on, solid , stabilizer , when everything goes wonky she stands stoic and firm. Perhaps too wonky now , her timing is precise as always, and looks as though she may exit shortly , gracefully, before the earth ignites."},

Birds have not moved into the  shabby bird house , understandably. Squirrels have not moved into the squirrel house on the cherry tree either. There is likely something dead in there.

It was lovely. We are used to seeing  DA productions on smaller home screens so the big screen was a treat, The weird part was that when they filmed in the south of France and then in England studios and the Abbey, their complexions remained very tanned from the southern sun, impossible in England - jarring! I guess they forgot about actor's make up.  Downtown is confusing, it is small but I felt myself lost as though I had never been there before.

Her work is similar and really should be famous but- stuck in little Bellingham - her art rarely sees the world. She had a show in NYC the year everything crashed, bad timing...the show did not open well. This photo of a docent in front of it was all that google offered.  No information about the painting or the artist anywhere.  I phoned the museum - only got a recording.So I am at a loss to tell you about it, anything other than I was deeply struck by this work. It is so heavy, the texture like road tar and cracked volcanic earth, then WHOOSH, the lightness of  wings lift it up from the fern-ed  cracked tortured ground.This morning , last night and yesterday afternoon, rain, it is cold, the heater is pumping. An aggressive gull came to the window , pounding with its substantial beak on the glass, causing more bird clatter in the house! Dennis put the mighty plastic hawk at the door and it did it's job! Sea gull curious but not curious enough to come any close than a few feet, looking sideways, not making eye contact- terrifying hawk! Yesterday we picked up the barrister's case in which  to house Dennis's meteorites. Such a deal! I bought the unit last week at the Assistance League for pittance. Made in the late 1800's with old wavy glass , brass knobs, lovely old thing. I thought I would need help toting it home as it looked weighty and solid, but it has been  built to come apart making it doable for one person to shift. (Why do they call it a barrister bookcase?Bookcases were designed with a series of self-contained shelving units that could be stacked upon each other in a free-standing bookcase. This lawyer's library of reference texts could then be suitably stored and moved and became known as the barrister bookcase.)It could have a better spot in the room but the spot that it wants is taken up by a huge defunct television, complete with gear that has not been used for three years , some things seem to be difficult to get rid of for some folks.

Bleah...no news. -0- Geranium bud in the front window  trying its best, stretching, leaning,  gathering all the sunlight it is able to gather. -0-        ----A decade of gun violence, culminating with the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, prompted the Australian government to take action.          Less than two weeks after Australia’s worst mass shooting, the federal government implemented a new program, banning rapid-fire rifles and shotguns, and unifying gun owner licensing and registrations across the country. In the next 10 years gun deaths in Australia fell by more than 50%. A 2010 study found the government’s 1997 buyback program – part of the overall reform – led to an average drop in firearm suicide rates of 74% in the five years that followed.           Other countries are also showing promising results after changing their gun laws. In South Africa, gun-related deaths almost halved over a 10-year-period after new gun legislation, the Firearms Control Act of 2000, went into force in July 2004. The new laws made it much more difficult to obtain a firearm.           In New Zealand, gun laws were swiftly amended after the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings. Just 24 hours after the attack, in which 51 people were killed, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the law would change. New Zealand’s parliament voted almost unanimously to change the country’s gun laws less than a month later, banning all military-style semi-automatic weapons.          Britain tightened its gun laws and banned most private handgun ownership after a mass shooting in 1996, a move that saw gun deaths drop by almost a quarter over a decade. In August 2021, a licensed firearms holder killed five people in Plymouth, England, marking the worst mass shooting since 2010. After the incident, police said the gunman’s firearm license had been returned to him just months after it was revoked, due to assault accusations. The British government then asked police to review their licensing practices and said that they would be bringing forward new guidance to improve background procedures, including social media checks.           Many countries around the world have been able to tackle gun violence. Yet, despite the thousands of lost lives in the US, only around half of US adults favor stricter gun laws, according to the recent Pew survey, and political reform remains at a standstill. The deadly cycle of violence seems destined to continue.----"},

They stood in the street below the garden, looked up and yelled, \"THERE it is!!\" They mis- named it a woodpecker, same courting habit but the flicker calls madly after the head banging on our chimney cap, hoping to get lucky. Dennis also tired of the amplified noise coming right into our room from the fire place, decided to get a \"hawk\". It will sit on the piano until he can figure out how to get it up on the roof.  I reckon the piano will be its home for a very long spell. There is  a new customer on the deck...a small handful of squirrel so different from our big grey Squirrel, she is not timid, she is tiny, she loves black sunflower seeds, the ones left out for the towhee. Black and red outfit, stylish little thing. Today was grannie day, so much fun with this child of the corn!!She will be standing by the end of the week! She is fond of her new teeth and likes to clack them on spoons, because she is a genius and a musician. She is trying out her wings also.  And her laugh is the silliest laugh I have ever heard- especially for one so wee- she sounds like an elderly person who smokes. It is endearing I must say.  Emily and Flora at the door saying \"Bye bye, see you tomorrow\"In the yard when I came home, this deer looks drunk, chewing cud and relaxing. She took no notice of me stumbling up the stairs with  too many groceries. I bought some groceries that I just wanted to try, like keto sweet potato tart...One tart is about one million calories and is about an inch in diameter. Ok, we all make mistakes... it was a tasty morsel .  I made stew. Weather changing again on the week  week end to be RAIN.  Oh wait, I take that back- rain happening NOW!

Always a stunning flower that does not last very long.At the moment they seem to be everywhere, waving in the breeze, showing off in a mighty nice display.They also just grow on their own- too much cultivation and they shrivel. They like to b e invisible i think but have failed in the long run.I would love to have a frock in that color, please. On we go along another path, closer to the bay where masses of wild roses are blooming. The fragrance nearly slaps you silly.The sky is matchy matchy.Deer proof tree, there are so many deer fences now ,with additional rabbit and squirrel wire mesh protecting gardens and yards. An alley cat, living under the shed where the roof got carried away in the rain. Growing ferns and moss and whatever else can live on a roof.The California poppies are the first to shout out - They seem to like the alley ways , also not wanting much cultivation, growing willy nilly along with the buttercups.Dennis thinks that they are weeds.I planted lavender and nasturtium along the rock wall one year - he tore them out, thinking \"weed\".He will never be a gardener.There were only orange poppies, still too early for bright red ones or for Shirley poppies. I have given up on poppies too, because...\"weeds\".Here we are back at home, that was a splendid walk, the sky is superb and my legs remembered how to propel me forward.  All of the neighbors are in a good mood , more than  willing to talk about improvements they have made to house and garden during covid time and monsoon season .(that has lasted far too long.) I met a little dog who was very old and like me, walked at snails pace. Good company!Oh, just two more - from the alley- Shamrock for luck and the bones of the boat protected by growing things.GREAT DAY!!! Thanks for coming along! You are the best company ever!when the sun shows up, and the eyes have been un- muddied, it is like being born into a new fresh world!  Three days of sun, no rain, & OH! how lovely everything is especially because of days and days and days, months, of rain!! Rarely , if ever, am I glad to return after a trip . This time is different, I am glad to be here! And one came back.... I am sure the Mama's are busy with their kits right now but this skinny one showed up and told me that it is well frowned upon to leave food for raccoons! In fact I think it is against the law...so....arrest me. Peg finally came back this morning as well. Polite hobbling, given breakfast and off she went. Life is great about now- not watching or seeing \"the news\"- spending some time looking at places to stay in London maybe in November if all goes according to my unplans.  Soon I will be pup sitting a friend's little dog for about three weeks while they go to England and Spain.  I do not know this little dog  and he does have some seizure issues, special diet and wants to be walked daily at least twice. This will snap me out of my bad sitting and eating and sitting and eating and BOOMPH-ness habits. ( how often have I seemed to have taken this very same face shot of a raccoon? I have many and they all look identical!) Peder's daughter is cleaning up their garden, working incredibly hard all around the property, making everything better. I just happened to look out at the perfect time to catch her in the Rhody digging weeds.This season is the big payoff! Beauty is abundant, blossoms are plump and EVERYTHING is well watered.  Having been in the desert during heat and dust storm , this is like dying and going to  some heavenly paradise. Still having a problem with comments. I am not being stuck up or unresponsive, I just am unable to leave my two cents. Not sure how to fix it."},

One died of a \"nervous break down\"...Portia was born of fine stock, studied music and theater, literature , the finest education. Taught music and voice, sang in the opera house in Texas somewhere. She studied psychology, philosophy,  and woo woo stuff, as that was the era of metaphysics madness, Madame Blavatsky, and the spirit people. She must have found time to bake and cook, her kitchen was well equipped.  Below is the refrigerator...She married Cabot but would not move in until he had built her her own apartment on the second floor, a \"dollhouse\" she called it. Everything  well designed for mini living.She insisted upon her own perm machine and gave perms to the desert women as well as instruction on how to live as a spiritually aware woman must.  Fried hair but their souls were moist...She wrote books and spoke at events- well renown along the coast of California  , for her profound  spiritual/ psychological wisdom, gifts  and talent.  Portia and Cabot met at one of her lectures, as he  also was involved in the spiritual movement - they hitched their wagons together. Her tiny apartment wants for nothing except maybe a tiny  piano...Cabot hoisted buckets of water up to her kitchen daily , she was well taken care of.  Her closet wasn't much, as you can see, but there were shelves for folded things and a mirror.About two feet wide and Four feet deep, squeezing in there was not easy.It was hooked up to electricity with a closet light and a window for ventilation. She had a small library and working desk, where she continued to write  , her books published readily.  She was the trend!Theirs was an interesting life to state the obvious. When Cabot died, however, Portia wasted no time moving back to the city, to a \"home\" of comfort  back to her homeland in Texas, where she died about four years later. I can think of no better arrangement than to have your own apartment in the marriage house, You upstairs, Him downstairs. Two kitchens, two sitting rooms, and two libraries.She also had her own outdoor balcony space to search for UFOs under the night sky.Cabot witched both the hot springs and the cold mountain spring on his land, she reckoned he was indeed magic.blogger is giving me grief by the way...I can not comment unless I go through many hoops, so If I do not respond that is why.

The rooms are very tiny, condensed living, the steps are so narrow that I am sure larger Americans would not be able to navigate them.  On we went, spent about three hours going thought the place without a guide, just we two. I had remembered the stories ,  helpful me.  here is some of his story. LINK I took many photos and have difficulty knowing which to post as I have posted this pueblo before. His windows are worthy, re-cycle champion with an artistic flair.The SPA house, natural 110 degree hot springs which he witched.Inside the main house which is so very tiny, the kitchen chair by the \"safe\" in the wall- a jar that was hidden when a piece of furniture was moved in front of it.  I guess security issues were not that important. Like the troglodytes in the south of France , making niches in the walls to use for shelves. His kitchen stuff was placed into the wall . A small ice box in the wall lined with thin sheets of metal that stayed cold enough, I guess, One might be able to fit a sandwich into it.This tiny  bed room ,elevated a bit so that the rats would be discouraged , was his preference instead of the apartment he had built for his wife upstairs. Holes with windows that semi opened for ventilation above, perfect for just one narrow man. This is the foot stool he used to get into bed, my shoe for scale. After he got into his bed the stool hung from a nail  on the wall above it. so that he would get out again. Such  condensed living space, thick walls, few windows, keeping things cool. Very clever building, mostly solo, few helped him . he had a burro that was a good helper, Named \"Merry Christmas\".The lowest room in the house called the\" earth room\" , dirt floor,    his toilet  behind that one foot wide dark wooden door. Nothing more than a very small bucket in there no room to stand or squat really, He was a gifted man! An agile man!!The railing. along the  narrow 16\" steps , to his wife's apartment. The only way she would move in would be to have a \"dollhouse\" to move into. He built her a very fine dollhouse . I will show you tomorrow If I think about it...you know, memory is the first to go...Below is the rear part of the pueblo, where the artists studios/living areas were, you can see that they were basic and very  small but everyone would gather outside anyway. Their view of the mountain nearby is far more impressive in actuality.I think that this was the original \"eagles nest\" that he built initially, before he built the pueblo. Very small of course and well protected built into the land. the screened window boxes are likely where he kept food and water.There is a meditation garden where the artists  gathered to calm themselves  for inspiration. The garden itself is not much really but it is pleasant enough , This is the bench.Clever use of tires making steps up to the upper part of the property.Everything was used, recycled bits and pieces to make door handles and what ever else .The cooker remains out back, where they all made their meals.This basket is enormous!Their mountain is spectacular, and the night sky is crisp and clear. wonderful place for artists to gather , do their work. See the wind mills at the base of the mountain?  They are massive really- made minuscule by the heft of the mountain. When Stella and I were there the town looked like a shabby desert meth town...it has been discovered! so many new, fancy, houses built . Money has moved in!"},

One of his daughters is here from The Hague for about two months , to help with tasks and to walk with him around the neighborhood. She made this cake, Mango, raspberry , vanilla cake with butter cream icing. Piled with vanilla bean ice cream, pistachio, and mango sorbet. One of the best cakes I have  ever devoured - and that includes my mother's , who was a champion cake maker.  I quit making cakes a few years ago because Dennis can not eat cake and the kids have flown the coop, I was  decent cake maker- learned how in 4-H when I was in third grade.  There was a contest , I came in second behind a girl named Rebecca, whose mother made her cake - they were just after the prize- I was after making the perfect cake myself just to hear my Dad and brother groan about how delicious it was. CAKE POWER!! I had it! leverage for \"negotiating\". Peder's wife , Mary, paints , She just picked up a brush one day - started with water colors, moved on to oils, went back to water colors because oils take too bloody long to dry up here in the octopuses garden. Every wall in the back of the house is covered top to bottom with her paintings, all of them are cheerful. This is her splash area.Peder is Dutch, he was part of the dutch resistance during the war, did time in a \"camp\", and has fascinating stories, speaks several languages and, when he was working, he was sent all over the world on KLM first class, He has so many of these KLM houses that some are not even on display. What a fine collection- and what a jealous neighbor he has.So that was Wednesday, Dennis MRI was just fine. He is scheduled for ablation in August sometime. That is a long time to wait!"},

Blue ring necked dove- and a turtle that was as large as a Volkswagon. he looks like he is so over it...A large bench carved out of some sort of desert thing that died for your  bottom's comfort.It is a worthy garden to visit,but not  the sort you might be compelled to relax in. Pondering the meaning of life in this garden might lead you to some  fatalistic philosophy.  Humans are too marshmallow soft for these clever -make- you- bleed  plants.There was so much  - my camera  clicked madly - this post  is just a small bit of what it clicked. A far more unusual botanical garden  than what we have in the north.

[…]It’s like this: if I had dropped out of college, thrown away my education, depended on my parents … if I had done all that, which is what the anti-abortion people want me to have done, I would have borne a child for them, … the authorities, the theorists, the fundamentalists; I would have born a child for them, their child.But I would not have born my own first child, or second child, or third child. My children.The life of that fetus would have prevented, would have aborted, three other fetuses … the three wanted children, the three I had with my husband—whom, if I had not aborted the unwanted one, I would never have met … I would have been an “unwed mother” of a three-year-old in California, without work, with half an education, living off her parents….But it is the children I have to come back to, my children Elisabeth, Caroline, Theodore, my joy, my pride, my loves.

The \"desert daggar\" - Joshua Tree ( named by the Mormons traveling west.)The name that  stuck because it sounded more appealing, I guess, and has more of a fascinating story behind it.The \"trees\" are not really trees, they are in the Agave family. They grow very slowly, living in harsh conditions, special because they are fussy about where they grow, the altitude must be just right and the soil must be barren and dry.  They clearly have something to prove.Some of the boulders are circumcised.Some have butts.these ^ are the laziest boulders I ever did see. Stoned, probably. ( I know...it was just too easy)Yucca blossom.Pointy sharp blossomgorgeous color, hearty and delicate at the same time.  A come closer, get away,  fearful attachment plant.In fact I think most of the plants in the desert have psychological issues. They do have every reason to feel cranky. some of the cactus rides on the wind and latches on to humans and coyotes that are wandering through. They are attack cactus - unpleasant but talented,  respect ! Growing all along the ground, very tiny flowers and leaves  hold the sand down  as well as they can- Rattlesnake weed. \"Like most spurges, rattlesnake weed secretes an acrid, milky sap containing alkaloids poisonous to humans, with emetic and cathartic properties that may be misconstrued as curative.\"See the tiny people up there - scale.So, OK , impressive but not life changing amazing , as promoted. I would have rather shopped for rodeo queen outfits with Stella. Nearly lost my balance a couple of times and believe me- not a good place to fall! So, that is that, I have saved you the trouble of the long drive to the globs and spikes and toxic ground cover. No need to thank us, we needed to burn a tank of  $7.50 a gallon -gas anyway. I was more impressed by the botanical growth in this harsh area than the wonder of its formation . Such sturdy stabby clever  survivor plants, which we must emulate if we are to make it through the next few years. We  had been advised, \" you must, absolutely MUST, drive to Joshua Tree  national park\"! It took a few hours and midway we stopped at these shops  because...obvious!There is a stretch of road with little businesses across from one another and side by side, women owned and run. Of course they are cooler than anything in the desert, because woman!The Hippie chicken shop sells chickens and eggs and chicken feed. She also sells fire wood , in case the desert is not hot enough for you!The other magnificent shop,decorated so stunningly, is full of the most carefully curated goods. We were in a hurry, and by \"we\" I mean Dennis- and a good thing too, because I would have purchased a couple of elephants and a delightful embroidered  fancy frock.Dear lord pull me up off of the ground- just look at these shit kickers!! Holy  Queen of the rodeo!Yes , would have had to have those as well. Dennis impatiently revving the engine - had to leave without a single purchase. If Stella had been on this holiday instead  of Mr. Man we would have had  to take out a loan, rob a bank, steal a wallet, knock off a rich granny, dip into everyone's  retirement funds- Dennis , I guess, saved the day! Got me out of there quick! Oh, but those boots! And the elephants!I could have done well with a sweet young rooster too. I would send him to Mary in Lloyd , probably , to keep her girls happy , Liberace on his toes , an  additional morning alarm. It would have been great, but, sorry, Mary, Dennis was ,you know, REVVING. So....Still had miles and miles to drive before reaching the \"Utterly  incredibly, beautiful and amazing park\". So said the  hyperbolic  recommenders ,  expectations  well in place-  heart racing excitement \" we are going to see something beyond fantastic!!!! It is going to blind us with beauty!!\" ... I will take you there tomorrow,  you can be the judge. On we go- Dr. Seuss plants ahead means we are close.  hang on to your bonnets!!! Oh boy Oh boy something spectacular near by."},

We are all a bit  vulnerable and shaky as this country dive bombs into the depths of evil, I wish  a fluffy cloud   for y'all.  We are beyond befuddled- beyond angry- beyond beyond. I -just -don't- fucking- know.Anyway, we are back in the town of subdued excitement, having spent the past 13 days in a surreal situation- we did some stuff and I took loads of photos so I will have something to occupy my blog other than this  bullshit country of bullshit's bullshit. We got up this morning at 3:30 AM. to catch a 6:00 AM  flight- it did not go seamlessly- but we made it, Ok.  I think I am\" over \" the desert now. I have no desire to return. The plants were crispy  thirsty, our house is a mess, A dress was delivered while I was gone. I do not remember ordering it -It is gross! A terrible thing covered in little tiny stars, on blue. Oh dear. I must have been momentarily mind- gone -to- the -dogs delusional to have ordered  an Aunt Bea frock. It is gigantic- the sad part  is that it  will probably fit me perfectly -  appropriate  wear for  the box social  held in the church basement on Tuesday or wearing for the staring role as Norman Bates Mom. I will quit ragging out now and  leave you with some gay happy GAY gay  color from the streets of gay  Palm  Gay Springs. a comfortable gay town!Michael and Scott  are married, probably, anyway  - they rented  their condo  to us for a steal of a deal. In my bedroom there was this piece of work, signed by the artist. The title also in the corner , difficult to see. Michael and Scott had never really looked at it , just thought it was a bit of unusual Asian art that came with the condo when they purchased it. Had all the right colors for the room and was innocuous.  subtle much?Michael , horrified after I sent him a text message with blown up photo,  no idea  - fair enough, there's not a lot of \"Pussy Face\" art about  ( the title , off to one side , difficult to see). Pretty sure that the painting will be elsewhere when M and S move back into their condo.... hilarious. I managed to read all of your blogs, by the way, I could not post or comment because my IPAD is ancient and only does minimum requests, like turns on and turns off... I am hopeless using my phone too. I have been keeping up with you though, loving your blogs so much! You are all so smart and sassy, love you dearly! Xx"},

The photo  -me in the custom cab  15 years later after driving it  to the PNW to haul cords of wood and to make life easier living like a damned pioneer. Dad got a new car- fancy!We were both happy about the deal! He sold it to me for a dollar.  Anyway, back to the Ice cream-We drove  miles  to Fort Steele because Dad loved to see where the Rail Road had been defended  against Indians- built in 1868 until 1886- transcontinental RR , one of the  places where his grand dad worked as a lawman. It became a small military town during that time. The school house remains, out there in the  nothing windswept dirt. Photos captured from google.  chimneys  are still erect and a grave yard is still there, but mostly dirt.The UTEs were tired of white man taking over their land , they fought hard, finally settled on some kind of broken treaty and lost. Big surprise. Great grand dad cowboy-ed  in that area, before he became the night Marshal, another reason Dad had an affinity for the place, I guess. After going through the little towns of Sinclair and Fort Steele we went a few zillion  more miles up to Como bluff , where dad showed me the oldest house in the world-The house that once walked!  Made entirely of dinosaur bones, 5,796 to be exact. Built on dinosaur graveyard, where 247 of 250 known Jurassic era mammals lived and died, Como Bluff is one of the most significant locations in Paleontology. It was a way station and became , appropriately,  part of a gas station. Where the deer and antelope play. Wind howls steadily, dust devils whirl. Wyoming beats you up!Rattlesnakes  everywhere but not scary, they mind their own business unless some idiot harasses them or, unless, they are  blinded by shedding their skin. Anyway the sign might scare off the folks who have no business being in Wyoming. Slickers!Wyoming folks are welcoming and friendly usually , unless you are an idiot or a goddam  hippie.We finally make it to our destination  just \" to get an ice cream cone\" several zillion hundred miles later. Medicine Bow. A scoop of chocolate and one of chocolate chip- dad always had a scoop of  vanilla on another scoop of vanilla. Fancy going all that way for vanilla? Nothing much exists in Medicine Bow- I think the population is around two hundred maybe fewer these days.Known for its Virginian Hotel and for being a way  station on the  old Lincoln highway between Laramie and Rawlins also known for the most serious plane crash ever in  1955. United flight 409 carrying military and Mormon Tabernacle choir smacked into the highest peak in southern Wyoming, Medicine Bow Peak The charred mountain side still remains  charred , bits of the flight can still be found.  We always stopped , got real quiet, and thought about it - I swore I would never fly in an airplane, ever , or sing in the Mormon Tabernacle choir.  Whenever Dad said \"hop in the truck\"- I knew the drive would be a daylong event, Wyoming is vacant and large -generally we were the only vehicle on the road or off road, depending on Dad's whim. \"Hop in the truck \" meant not seeing your friends , not talking on the phone, not waiting for something-anything, to please happen. Hours alone, in the middle of dirt and wind , one  had to be creative. Glad I grew up there, it was good  \"training\". Couldn't wait to leave!  Like they say \"a good place to be from.\" My sentimental journey for the day -glad you tagged along. Now on to more important things than dilly dallying around in the past- cleaning before we leave for fourteen days. Meh..."},

Ours might be worth , maybe,  a nickle BUT we have wild life and they don't. Priorities....I have never paid much attention to Douglas fir, just took it for granted, like  the rest of the trees in the neighborhood. The sun hit this one just right and gave me an eye full of sparking blue. The sap is highly flammable , used for coating small sticks to take on a hike. Great for starting fires without smoke.  Douglas Fir is edible and medicinal , used by the Salish for centuries. When I was new to this area I studied wild plants and harvested a good many of them , we ate a lot from the forest and the bay. I rarely went to the grocery store, plus I had a year round garden and got free eggs ,  rejected  imperfect ones from  the university  farm. Easy living!                              Everything you ever wanted to know about Douglas.Left over daffodils ,  angry. They have been bashed by wind and heavy rain and are just over it, thank you very much.  Look at those faces! Not happy.Growing in the rock wall- Lamium pupureum- edible when young and packed with goodness. Volunteers that usually get weeded out - they will over take a patch of ground in short order. The tops and the flowers are delicious. Our rock wall is producing  rock babies, too. It is interesting to see what the wall attracts, there are of course weeds not wanted but I like to leave them there. They went to all of the trouble to grow in rock and knit the stones together so gravity has less of a chance. Dark clouds rolling in again, temperature is on the edge - Layers of clothing worn. Weirdest spring I can remember! But , then, my memory is not to be trusted....for instance, this morning I could not remember what planet I was on. It's getting weird out there!"},

One mile away, in the village where I once lived, they grew abundantly by the wet land and bay. The marsh is safe from people, We built a floating walk way across  so that we could study samples of crawly things in the water as well as botany- didn't last long but then, we only had a few tools and only used found wood- our \"furniture\" was drift wood. The trees are gone, things change so rapidly. I am sure that the pussy willows were very old and had had their time pumping out pussies every year. Willow trees do not last forever.\"I know a little pussy, her coat is silver grey, she lives out in the meadow and she'll never run away. She's just a little pussy, she 'll never be a cat- cause she's a pussy willow- What do you think of that!\" We drove through the neighborhood in between our house and the bay searching, searching...no pussies.I was totally distracted by the amazing clouds -  perfection with crisp edges, nearly solid!

{"title": "ghosts", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2022", "text": "\"You can never go home again\"- Thomas Wolfe, 1940. This was our house in the middle of dirt, My folks bought the concrete shell  after the war, in 1946. My Dad built the rest of it adding a finished basement, a dinning room, a garage,  hot beds, a garden. He grew  amazing flowers, vegetables, apples ,trees,  lilac bushes ,strawberries, and a  loaded raspberry patch sheltered from the wind in between the other gardens and the garage. He built a concrete incinerator where we burned cardboard and trash that would not compost. It was  a frightening jack in the box - feral cats would get in through the ash door at ground level,  and fly out of the top when the heavy metal cover was shifted to put  the trash in. Feral cats did not fly silently- they screamed as they made contact with your face. Dad sometimes would take his twenty two  when he dumped the trash. Dad lined all of the edges with marigolds  and mums to keep bugs away, He built the cute picket fence all around the back and put in gently sloping curbs to the street so that our bicycles would have a smooth transition. His Gladiolas grew up the side of the garage and were surreal in their splendor! He roofed it entirely with red tiles, planted a blue spruce which loved growing too big- and built a red and white concrete checkerboard patio out the back door  surrounded by tall cedar planks and a glorious wooden gate.Arial view of back then- our house on the corner , left of  center, at the top of Buffalo street. The long white apartment building kitty- corner was where the feral cat community lived, appropriately, not far to go for \"shopping\" to our incinerator. I went for a google walk around the town. It is not at all the same, not even familiar. This is our house now.  Oh dear!Our famous and fabulous front street , always a source of pranks and hooliganism- bars and whore houses, really should have remained in tact. History of the West right there!I have posted this photo of Virginia's drawing of front street before, good thing she captured it when she did.  This lone building is all that is left of the entire street of shoot 'em up bars and whores, so much a part of our growing up . It is the bar with a star , \"Cosy Rooms' - side door. So sad that everything was torn down in a fit of righteousness. Damn! Driving around with the google truck was so sad.What you see here is a ghost. The google van does not go to that little town often  , so, the google trip through town knits times and trips  together, there are three different times of when our house's photo was taken in different stages of disrepair, turn the google corner and it becomes another house in another time , and then back again. So weird, but the weirdest is one of the photos, which I zoomed in on,  our forever across the street neighbor- their children and my brother and I grew up like siblings , shared kitchens and what ever the moms had going- Cookies and oranges generally.  Arty and my Dad worked the same job , same interests, and went to high school together , so Yes, long time friends. One time Arty and my Dad drove a tractor into the school  late at night and cemented the doors to the school shut. Anyway, Arty died in 2005- but there he is sitting on the front porch looking right at you and me.  Interesting travel:https://www.space.com/hologram-doctor-space-station-nasa-astronauts?utm_source=notification"},

My Grandmother, Lily,  and Helga, double wedding. Everyone spoke block head from the north. They cooked , were good wives, had children, Lilly had four boys and Helga had three. Best friends until Lily died at age 52. I missed out on having a real grannie and Helga just did not fill the bill. She rarely spoke to us, maybe because of her limited English, I will give her that but also because she thought children were to stay away. Definitely not to be  heard.

I thought that maybe eating three chicken tacos would make me feel better, It did not,  surely five chocolate chip cookies would...they did not. -0-Funny how you can be married to a person for 100 years and not have heard every story six or seven times- The Man told me one that was new to me, probably because the Man was ashamed it happened and did not want to sully his stellar reputation. When he was in high school , just graduating, his good friend also was graduating. His friend , we will call him  Doug to protect his identity, had offers from the best universities in the land because Doug was absolutely brilliant. His folks were so proud of him . His folks were also a little bit too pushy when it came to their son's decisions.  Doug decided that he wanted more than anything to be a pastor. All his life he just wanted to pastor - ize. \"Absolutely NOT\" , they said.The only way he could fulfill his dream was to fake his own death.The Man helped him, rowed out in two boats, left one with Doug's hat - Doug found his way to California where he hid. The parents were devastated to have lost their golden child, there was a service, everyone wept....then things did not quite add up. The law came to the door with Doug's father and took the Man to the station where he told them the story. The good thing was that the law sided with the boys and thought the parents were too controlling- after all the lad wanted to serve the lord...so, nobody got thrown into the slammer, I guess they were just out a few bucks for funeral flowers and heartache. Wild! See what eventually  comes out if one sticks around long enough? We have been married since  July 1985- that is pretty close to forever isn't it? Probably on his death bed he will have more skeletons rattling  out of the closet.  Whomever is around then will be well entertained. Happy Spring! here he is again."},

Ever hopeful. I nurtured a succulent  for years, watering it, changing the soil, putting it in the sunniest window. It was very real looking plastic,  never would have grown no matter how much I babied it. I still have it but it is in the toy box now or in a drawer somewhere.  Imagine my surprise after years . to finally realize it was not the real deal. Still laughing at myself- at least Dennis's folly made more sense. Old people- aren't we a hoot?Anyway I got my Flora Jane fix today, she has a tooth for real and she fell asleep on my shoulder  after more than  the usual rocking and singing.  She is not fussy about the tunes I choose to sing even if it is  nonsense words and made up melody.

(what?) Ok, so he did have covid and clearly his health is not good, some say cancer, some say steroids, some say dementia, I don't care why the man is off the rails - just want him put out of our misery. ...mad man trying to \"make his mark\" in history?In the next three weeks , because of weather, he intends to complete his mission, to have Ukraine and all of its horrific damage in his back pocket. If NATO countries  do not step up big time, in spite of the threats, all will be lost and the history of this time will not favor the so called\"free world\" either. Insane game.That is what is on our minds this Sunday. April 3. Poster placed in  top window not very visible but still we know it is there sending out hope rays through the green tinted glass making it look less committed, kind of subdued without magic.  We send more donations and cash, no idea if it is helpful, what else can we do. This is a tough one to ride out.Blooms in the window, and two books getting ready to travel to the kids in Portland, who are thinking of land and getting back to it, as we all have done. Country wisdom and Know How is loaded  with everything anyone ever wanted to know about practicalities. It came in handy once upon a time, and of course, The Whole Earth Catalog, best illustrations of How-to's and great ideas of when to's and how many  to's. The kids are looking for land ( good luck with that youngins $$$$)  on which to build self sustaining tiny homes/ gardens/ chickens, whatever. You remember the dream. I sent them a cheesecake for April first. A comfort cake. I seriously doubt that the kids could do without their electronics so unless the \"land \"is plugged into a power station, it is not likely that they would stick with the idea of \"back to the land\" for very long.

Then ,pretty soon , he was walking and talking and driving and gone. What's THAT about???I sent Erik this old photo of MOTHER because he said he has a friend that looks  like the younger moi and he wanted proof. I also  found this old hand print of Erik's just now so thought I would include it in the birthday post. He was so  small once upon a time.  I tried to duplicate the pose of then and now.Couldn't do it- I look pretty much like a whole other another person. Crabby.Anyway, I tried ,  for a lark, because I could remember how to braid my two hairs together and because I have a phone that takes a picture when I poke the button!  Age is a leveler is it not? Kind of groovy  to see a then and now. Below Erik being everything all at once, A hero , of every sort, He is about ten feet taller now, still a hero of every sort in my  Mama heart.So, one kid will be 56 and one kid will be 35 ( did I do the math correctly?) and on we go. A one way ticket !  Race to the finish !-0-Last evening on the deck- a pretty pastel ribbon  of sunlight behind the plum looked celebratory! Of course Wayne , oldest son, and Erik youngest son, will stay in their cities and we will be having no cake.

The park  is an improvement , becoming sort of  festive-  looks industrial cool, Georgia Pacific toilet paper- ish, but coming along and the young folks really like it. The air , I have mentions before, is MJ fragrant. a spliff in one hand, a sandwich in the other, riding a unicycle. All things are possible.  This bright grass grows all along the walk way.Through the car radio a program touting the glory of living in this area, mostly Seattle. The best bits are : book shops on every corner - Unesco  has named Seattle \"World Literature city\", poetry and writing events are abundant, reading is the main activity. Of course it is- eight months of darkness will encourage that- as well as in door hobbies and art. Silver lining to the  drippy dark soggy long cold winters.-0-This morning Peg came around at the usual time. She has been coming here for years and years and I did not think at first, that she would live very long with only one  leg. She wobbles and loses her balance on the railing sometimes but that does not seem to phase her.  She is doing very well and is such a lady. The most polite seagull I have ever known.  I've mentioned this before I know...A sweetie, never thought I would say that about a seagull!  She prefers string cheese and tuna , not apples or beets  and especially not seeds, Her beak is not built for that . Her open mouth is as large as her whole self- I am amazed when she  scoffs a wad of chicken as big as my fist in one gulp. Such a talented girl!"},
{"title": "old post cards", "date": "Monday, March 28, 2022", "text": "Dear old Wyoming friend ,now living in NYC, found an old book full of post cards collected by  some  traveler  through the west back in the early 1900's,  images mostly of Wyoming.She painstakingly removed the cards from their elmer glue-ish housing ,cleaned them up, hoping to get it framed soon. She sent remaining cards of our area up here in the PNW in an envelope with snazzy stamps.There are some amazing images in this collection, a few of the old buildings still stand but OH MY how things have changed!Chief Si'ahl, anglicized \"Seattle\", made friends with white man snake eyes, thus naming the city after him. He delivered lovely speeches full of goodwill and trust that white man would be a caring  steward  of the land. He himself was a warrior, led an attack wiping out the Chimicum tribe south of Port Townsend, genocide, stole women for his wives and took slaves, you know, as you do when you are dubbed a fine warrior man.History really has no heroes, only myths. The old idyllic images,  propaganda to lure easterners west, are magnificent hyperbolic enticing come ons. It worked I guess, over the time span of ninety years or so the PNW has become well and truly populated. For the most part it is a decent crowd-  many colleges and universities, book stores and galleries. Anyway Chief Seattle spoke heroically but...There are momentary  heroic acts - like Will Smith clocking Chris rock at the Oscars. \"hooray\", acts that seem violent that make one shout \"hooray\" can make  myth real for a moment. We need to send Will to Russia for lunch with Pootun. (Funny how Pootun and Trump ( fart) are at the shitty end of all things- there is so much in a name.)\" But actress Tiffani Haddish spoke for many when she praised Smith for defending his wife.  \"Maybe the world might not like how it went down, but for me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen,\" she told People Magazine. Haddish, who co-starred with Pinkett Smith in the film Girls Trip, said black women are often the subject of jokes and ridicule, so seeing a black man stand up for his wife \"meant so much to me\".  Many black Americans noted the irony in the fact that Chris Rock produced the documentary Good Hair about how important hair is in black culture, only to joke about Pinkett Smith's chosen hairstyle. Pinkett Smith is one of many women who have recently gone public about their fight with alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss and affects many black women.\"If you had to choose a name for yourself as you are now in this life what would it be.I am afraid I would change mine hourly but it would never be fecal matter or gas.  I may choose \"Will\" for when I am feeling piqued, and \"Jada\" for when I am feeling brave.-0- Here are some things growing in the yard this morning.

She took us here on Beamz this morning  with her youngest son. Her husband has gone back to Urkaine to plant crops for the people in hopes that the war will cease and the land will flourish again. The only things her little boy took as they escaped were these toys, \"take the most important things with you\" they said.He holds a quote , ironically ,by Dostoevsky. \"The soul is healed by being with children\".Amalia the girl under the flag is fashioned from this girl singing in a shelter. Each toy beneath the flag blanket represents a country supporting Ukraine. Poland, Finland, USA, Chzeck Republic, Germany, Great Britain,and France. I quickly made a flag for our window , on poster board. It is what I had on hand so not particularly fab but will do for now. I will put it above the blooming wooden tulips facing out to the street where the Q-Anoners will be able to see. Not to make them even more angry but maybe to enlighten a bit.

Putin has nothing to lose but his worthless life,  Bin Laden style. From the web:NATO has been amassing battalion-size \"battlegroups\" in countries along the alliance's eastern flank in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. These forces are prepared for combat and are led by the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and the U.S., respectively. The alliance has sent planes and ships to NATO territory in eastern and southeastern Europe, and there's a multinational brigade in Romania.    Last week NATO announced it would create four new battlegroups in Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.

So far, the alliance has not met one repeated request by Ukrainian President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy: to impose a no-fly zone. That's because NATO fears that doing so would lead to direct combat with Russia, widening the conflict into a regional war and potentially even a third World War."},

I am allergic to caracol so that entire package is wasted- It works wonders for some folks. Popular in Mexico and France. Anyone want it?? Maelove is excellent and affordable, developed by MIT science persons, organic, cruelty free, no animals used. Anyway it is superior product- no disappointments with anything from there. Murad- nope, don't  get involved with that company. BOOM products are gentle and subtle , decent enough, light easy to use all day. Weleda from Switzerland is good for baby products and I suppose skin food is good but I am allergic to that as well even though it is made with honest ingredients. Ayurveda is the thing of the day, I have gone through two bottles already of face stuff. This just came in the post and I have not tried it yet. Hair nourishment oil should be interesting- Winter has dried hair to flammable straw, no body light a match! So anything I can use that calms it down a bit will be a blessing. Once a long time ago I tried some sort of goo from the black section of the drug store and applied liberal amounts to my air hair thinking that it could only be a good thing, because look at how lovely black hair can be!  I was wrong, it took three weeks of washing my hair  twice a day to remove the \"conditioner\" that flattened my hair to my pate utterly. It was likely some sort of petroleum product built to tame natural black hair that wanted to be tamed. I am about to comb this new Iyura product through my cob web hair- will let you know.

The  damned scare days! Also it was single portion so that Dennis would not even be tempted as he only eats about three things on his life saving Keto diet, cheese, eggs and heavy cream.The food came frozen and it was tasty enough and the portions were perfect, however- remember when arthritis and all sort of painful events showed up and I gimped along, taking CBD and turmeric and ginger- OK- turns out that the overly processed food, built to withstand hundreds of years in a bunker, flared every potential inflammation in this old truck.

Pinched the photos from google.The comments are surprising- never read comments about anything in this world if you wish to remain in a happy place. The orange butt plug changed everything. This sweet little place decorated wildly, complete with a clown toilet- has been called the libtard connection. So many cool places have closed . One of our faves downtown, closed recently - The Temple Bar, where we went to \"drink and draw night\". live models with themes, like \"pulp chicks\" or \"  swamp pirates\". three minute sketches and five minute sketches, best sketch gets a shot on the house. Not too far into the night the drawings express the inner child of the drawer, regressing to scribbles and hilarity. Good thing I have developed agoraphobia due to lengthy lock down.  There is really no place left to go in town. Here is a joyful photo of Lisa and Christianna and Arthur bear, that came in  the mail today.   Gratitude for the swimmers of Lisa's brother. Arthur  is a fine baby. Wonderful parents and Arthur is Flora's best friend, love how that worked out. Stay well, y'all. protect your hearts, count blades of grass, anything that keeps you afloat. I made a mistake today , read some of \"the stuff\" - sent me into a tailspin. This photo saved me. Aren't they darling!!! Arthur is such a lovely baby- word is that he is too excited to be here, in this life,  rarely sleeping. He is ON!"},

Today and yesterday have been a tease for sure, Lovely sunshine and 50 degree temperature! Tropical!Yesterday I went over to Flora Jane's house to deliver books, such an idyllic scene - Emily pruning back bushes with  cutters twice her size, Baby Flora in the sunshine on a sheepskin, teaching  her stuffed rabbit \"Flora speak\". She had her passport photo taken  an hour before- It is good for five years. I think that when she is five she may not be pleased with this photo of a seven month old. Anyway, she is set for the near future, going to Canada soon and later in the summer to England for a wedding. This photo does make me laugh- her enthusiasm !!! Janet, Cubby's mom, has gone to Rhode Island- left two days ago. I am flower sitting her orchids. She bought a one way ticket, Cubby is traveling with her so there is no telling when or IF she will return. Before she left she brought two porridge bowls  over , one for Dennis and one for me. She had a number of them in a set so her idea was to give them to loved ones ,\"family\", and we would all be connected when we used our bowls. Lovely idea!The little cream pitcher is from my stuff  purchased from a London charity shop in Brixton for 10P. It is a souvenir from Frinton-On-Sea. A place I would surely skip  having read the Guardian article. It sounds like the town where joy goes to die. Last night I stayed up beyond midnight and binge watched \"REACHER\" , Such a cartoon of a story and cartoony  man, Reacher. It is wonderful!  He is who we need right now ! A giant of a man, no nonsense, straight forward, travels light, does not hesitate- All the bad guys get their asses kicked into the next life- no rules just doing  what is the right thing to do! Unlike NATO at the moment and the US.- how long did it take for the U.S. to enter WW2??? A bit late on the draw I would say - \"no body wants war\"- it is not about \"want\". Close the sky over Ukraine- the worst is going to happen anyway as long as Putin is alive so- be like Reacher- do not hesitate.Oppenheimer the door! from CNN         \"As a commander of US Army troops that defeated the Nazi regime in Germany 77 years ago, Gen. Omar Bradley knew a lot about war. Three years after the Second World War ended, he warned, “The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living.”"},

Its history seems consistent with borderline personality disorder.    -0-Yesterday was world book day. I bought some for Flora because , genius baby...also reading to new humans from birth until ever is recommended. These books are drool proof pretty much and can be handled by tiny hands.  Beautiful day yesterday, today not so much. The queens managed to get  charged on the sill , waving at the clouds , which were astounding all day. Rarely do we have such lovely clouds.  An amazing  sky parade.These are very normal to most of you who live under better skies, but to us it is an event. Another painting by Maria, sunflowers of course, blue and yellow. The Ukrainian Gramma that offered seeds to the Russian enemy saying \" Put seeds in your pocket so they will grow when you die on Ukrainian soil\" - later she said \"you came here uninvited, you are enemy, pieces of shit\"  Grannies , I swear, will win this war!  Plus , for the superstitious Russian soldier, The Ukrainian grannies have claimed to have powers and curses, it is believed by some to be the most potent in all the world. There are no sunflowers in this house right now, so these will have to do.Olga, it was relayed on BEAMZ this morning , has arrived in Budapest with her family and may be on the way to Prague. Beamsters taking care of them along the way. That is the good news. They will have some place to stay, Beamz is sending clothing and medical supplies - essentials. So far I must say BEAMZ is a great invention. Apologized to offspring today for birthing them in such intense crazy times, and it just keeps piling on doesn't it! My advice is- find beauty, be good, do what you love, eat everything bad for you because it is delicious- fuck the future."},

Can you even fathom that you were once this mini? On the way home I went up the hill beyond our house to see if Lairmont Manor  is still there. It is.It was built in 1913 by the  racist  family who decided that all of Fairhaven and Edgemoor would remain white forever,  their offspring ,who  later developed Fairhaven made it a sort of law.The stairs that go nowhere...There is another set exactly like this on the other side. WHY? Maybe for photos of brides or something. maybe a visual metaphor for \"stuck\".  The manor , after being a home, became a residence for the sisters of Saint Joe- now it is a venue for weddings and parties. Been to a few and catered a few- I would say it is an average manor and the kitchen is inadequate. In 1949 , the developer declared this Gtee. the last paragraph forbidding any sale of houses in the area be sold to anyone other than a white guy.  We were sent this from a local real estate company to demand that this be stricken from the rules. Well, of course. We did not even know it existed- but that is old time racism for you. Hidden in the small print in forgotten documents,  dug out and used in the NOW . Good that it surfaced.Anyway- it has been dealt with- Can't wait until one day  a family of color buys the manor, that would be swell!I thought that this tree was in bloom until I got closer. Crazy hair branch tree, not the botanical name for it but will do.-0-This little book from 1944 also surfaced - It was in with some old birth certificates of dead folks and family tree stuff. We are not Russian and this little book does not have translations for the things we want to say  right now. It only has polite travel conversational language, so, the title is a lie. I watched BEAMZ , \"united for Ukraine\" this morning. Olga actually was able to connect and to relay what is going on where she is now. They will soon leave the little village where they have been for six days, escaping their home, Kyiv, under shelling. Now, she said, the circle of Russian troops is closing in on all of Ukraine and they must flee the country if they are able. There is no light, no petrol, no food, it is very cold and terrifying, needless to say. Because she has three children under the age of sixteen they, including her husband , will be allowed out if they make it to the border. He will not have to stay and fight. I must say, this is the last horror  I expected at this time - I mean, maybe someday, like if the Orange butthole got elected again- but not now...I was getting comfortable. OOPS. Duck and cover, been preparing all of our lives. -0-This is the paragraph in case you could not see the larger page. So, I guess you could have your servants be brown but , well, you know.

Now, like everything, the quality is iffy,their return policy is good, though, so I still order things that look great on the models in arsty shots but not so great on this shorty, it's a crap shoot. The white haired woman has been one of their favorite models for ever- she has always looked the same and always stunning. Some of their models just look like the neighbor lady who has a couple of kids and a mortgage, drives a Volvo station wagon , and eats mince pies in the closet, probably.OH the colors- Yes to this!I can always find something that matches the flowers on the table.Flora could wear oatmeal and look fantastic-  Here she is in her newly painted high chair , playing with a bean.   WILD.

Fascinating history, as human history usually is. AND now it repeats.So here we are yet again- living history of human horror ruled by egocentric mad men with too much  insanity and power. Yesterday I tuned in to Olga , who is usually in Kyiv for her tours. This is where she bravely live streamed for 45 minutes. From a basement bomb shelter six hours from her home with her three children and her husband -shelling heard above ground.Her little boy ,terrified ,would not leave her side. Olga, ever the optimist, done crying, for now. Just glad to have a \"safe\" place to go.Putin threatening nukes- Pacific Northwest being ground zero- many are not aware- Of course  Bangor Trident, and Jim Creek, but there are others secreted away. Good to be at ground zero if things are going to go that route! I am taken to our bookshelf to find Raymond Briggs, \"When The Wind Blows\"- a foretelling, horrifying and so very sad.  Though after this there would be no more  bookshelves or libraries , no more humans with cards to scan or sandwich picnics  on  library lawns. Raymond Briggs Book would no longer be  a \"what if\".I purchased  a pie safe. I actually got it for keeping fruit flies at bay , away from the massive amount of bananas I seem to inhale. I am over bananas for now and the fruit flies are too frozen to have much interest, so I will use it to house the orphans and Polish grandmothers. (dolls) The screen will be as effective as \"duck and cover\",  a \"safe place\" illusion. Stay well y'all- stick around out of curiosity if nothing else- and for flowers, grandchildren, robins in spring and loved ones...and for all the amazing beloved bloggers who wear hearts on sleeves, whom \"I like so very much\", as Mary Moon's Delightful August would proclaim.

The hospital was kept cold , about 66 degrees freezing everyone- $$$$ cheap assed hospital - the nurses don't mind too much as they are constantly on the run but the patients  are dead person's temperature, shivering in their thin little blankets.

He spent the night in hospital. So lucky- that is a lot of blockage and at anytime it could have dislodged or choked everything utterly. The blockage is called \" widow maker\".

The fuck?Ok , so stabbing therapy  is in order- the fluffy kind. I am not done with this scruffy dog yet but he wanted his photo taken anyway. He was going to be tan but the wool was way too soft, probably great for spinning but not for stabbing into a mutt. His base is the way too soft  sloppy tan wool.  And this is how many mince pies I have stress eaten today. Did I savour them- don't think so, just one after the next - Pop Pop Pop. Did eating all of them make things seem better? Oh hell no. just added to my girth and disappointment. These times, children, these times! The refrigerator guys took the non functioning piece of rubbish today and replaced it with a new non rubbish one that Dennis insisted they unbox in the garage. He is thorough, that man! Fridge is plugged in and it WORKS!!! Yep the first one was a floor model, probably returned because it did not do cold- anyway, no wool over Dennis's eyes. We now have a more talented fridge.  Someone sent Dennis a message about a little dog that needs a home because it's human just had brain surgery and is unwell. We thought about it for about twenty minutes but decided that the dog was cute enough it would have no problem finding a home. Independence is a wonderful thing. We have that now and as much as a dog would bring us joy- nope, don't need  or want a needy pooch.

Fascinating as usual, Anna taking us to Rasputin's apartment in St. Petersburg. I spent all night watching DOC about the Romanovs, Bloody Sunday and the Bolsheviks. By 1:00 a.m. I was dizzy with the horror and drama and sadness of it all. What a history- one that went wanting after the soviet Union tried to cover it up. One that went wanting in our school curriculum as well- Red scare!\"Rather be dead than red\"....I did not study anything Russian until university when I took a year of Russian Lit. Opened up several new and thrilling avenues of appreciation. Desire to go to Saint Petersburg is strong. Putin will not have it though- looks like his assholyism is piqued. Damn! The postal worker ding donged at about 9:00 - delivering mince pies from Her Majesty's kitchen. Notice the \"best by\" date! I got four boxes and it is nearly March. Since they are bite sized pies I think I can meet the challenge.... I will do my best. I made bones for another dog while eating pies. The wool in the back ground is what I will start with for the base. Who knows how this dog will come to be- never predictable. Once the stabbing begins it just takes on a life of its own. I have no control. This damned vacuum! I want a burglar to come in and steal it please. Dennis bought it when Erik and I went to Texas to see my parents. While we were gone a salesman came to the door with a pitch that Dennis could not resist- claimed it as the best vacuum ever invented. It is not. It weighs a ton, requires bags and is LOUD. It sucks. When I got rid of manky wall to wall carpet and  put in pergo, there was little need for a vacuum at all.  I did buy a light weight Bissle that comes apart for cleaning- no dirt bags involved. It also sucks- but in a good way. Dennis continues to use this monster of a vacuum, it is manly and it must be the best because the salesman  promised- some 31 years ago. I wear noise mufflers to tolerate the loudness. It is a tank with a sound pitch that could bring Rasputin back from the dead.  The man still loves it and uses it for sawdust, bugs on the sill, dirt- and things of a manly nature. Here is a face, a Flora face, looking very much like her Dad.

A flutter of WTF panic, and then I reckoned that I must have been snoring loudly , maybe  Erik thought I was being attacked by a bear or something ,so turned on the lights because bears are not fond of lights. Wrong, Erik was sleep walking I found out in the morning. He said that he sometime does that- opens doors and turns on lights, middle of slumber, middle of night, and his housemates are like WTF ERIK? Of course he has no recollection.When covid first started lifetimes ago-Erik built pottery in their back yard. This is one of the cool pieces he did.

I can play with table runners.This one of bright color looks like California, not at all PNW, It lives in the closet , too. This steely, black splotchy one is probably the most bland. I like it, nuno felted on silk, looks industrial and would likely look best in a stainless steel world. This is the one I have settled on for the moment, (until Dennis gets back). It was the first attempt , looks sort of woodsy, I suppose. That's been my day- plus a realization that I really can not see well enough to drive. My lens has clouded over which is common they say and must be lazered  back to clarity, I have an appointment in a little over six weeks, the first appointment I could get. Blind in one eye and can't see out of the other , situation. It happened suddenly , surprising me when I could not see where I was going this morning. I had to back track twice. Scary woman behind the wheel. So, if not going out due to covid has not been enough, I  can not go out at all  now. Jesus, the Mamo folks better not call with lumpy news or I may just have to walk up to the middle school and score  a fentanyl sandwich. I am a sissy- I am the first to know this. More likely to say fug it than fight. Cheers to those brave women who do fight- I am full of admiration."},

The table is set magnificently. Queen is delighted. Born on April 21, 1929 puts her nearly on the cusp but well and truly a Taurus. \"Fresh, alive, new and sensual, this is a Taurus with a potential to overcome any obstacle you can imagine.\"And she has done! Such a remarkable person in remarkable times. WE LOVE her. Stella did present a fabulous tea- even made a party favor for her one guest, me. We thought about inviting others but decided that we really do not like anyone else and all of the cool folks have fled the area.Stella used to have a gaggle of joyful women living nearby. They are gone now. So, Stella will just have to put up with  her one tedious guest whose conversational skills are lacking. An  F word genius.Smoked salmon sandwiches , English cucumber salad, biscuits , pecans and chocolates. Stella's  home made lemon cupcakes with custard filling, and the sweetest , juiciest, vermilion , oranges on the planet.Stella made cocktails- aperol, lemoncello, vodka and orange juice.  Oh the skills that woman has!Cheers to the Queen , may her God watch over her and bring her peace. Truly a champion of our time on our  brief earth trip. And cheers to Stella, of course.People still out on the lake -  detachable dock , going for an early evening  spin. Not much time left for daylight . I had to scoot back home, leaving the most gracious hostess in the world to deal with the crumbs. (I am a terrible guest, do not invite me...) Can't see in the dark, well, I can't see at all for that matter. I clean my glasses constantly-  my glasses  are  not the problem. I must travel in daylight or endanger everyone on the road and end up in the slammer, or dead...or worse. Also , had to get back to  not feed the forest children.  Here is one showing the other a kibble. Feeding raccoons is prohibited so , yeah, I would never...Window guys are to finish this morning. Not sure if they are going to put the wood back up or just leave it under the table. If that is the case it will be under the table for a very long time. Damn."},

The way too large hat is put together- stuff from a forgotten drawer in the basement. I hope I get stopped by the law for being too fancy and thrown into fancy jail for the night. I could hob nob with all of the super rich criminals, make some connections, you see. -0-The window guys came for two days and will finish their job on Monday.  It's a big deal. I had no idea how much work it is- and how much destruction of trim is involved.  Upstairs is fairly well torn up for the time being. I moved everything away from walls and windows, all nineteen of them . In the corners and fallen behind the piano , things resurfaced. This book, one of my faves, had been behind piano for years. Glad to see it. And one of the left overs from when Pee man somehow got elected and the country went haywire. So much has gone even more haywire since! We are in such  deep doo doo. I am no longer looking at corporate news for \"news\". NOPE! I watched a DOC ,  a lengthy interview with Noam Chomsky ,last night. Puts things into perspective with the why's and how's and the wool over our  naive trusting  ill informed eyes. Truth is a difficult pill. Anyway, to help the medicine go down I listened to good old rock and roll until I felt the will to live- danced my bones around the kitchen.  Rock and roll will save the soul, it has been said.   -0-This baby is one of five in the yard today. Scruffy, not sure if molting is occurring early or if the deer have a disease. Nice to see them venturing out from the forest again, regardless of their not so great suits. ---Back to the new windows- just noticed already making a difference. Warmer house and very silent, the wind can roar and we do not hear it. The raccoons do not trust the new glass door, suspicious. They come up to the door and then scoot far back  very quickly - like the door is going to consume them or something. The glass, triple pane , is thick and tinted green so, yeah, kind of scary. OK, I am going to  get my big hat, try to fit it into the car and tootle on down to the Queen's tea. Cheers!

Obsessive , get on a roll and there I go. I have been watching Beamz tours obsessively- to the tune of several hundred dollars since December. Holding back a bit now, only watched one today. My favorite town , naturally.   I could not wait for the Queen to get here- I ate four violet/rose creams- thought I had gone to heaven without  the hassle of dying.I went out to my car a couple of nights ago to get something - Dennis stuck this to my back window. He apologized for the wrinkle. Now, when I am driving, I see her out of the corner of my eye and she does give me a start! I doubt that it will ever leave the window unless there is a four car pile up and my car is totaled, it is the strongest adhesive ever. It will not budge. The queen is forever stuck. Nothing going on at all. Same old every day, though I have moved everything away from the windows  and stacked it all elsewhere. The window guys are replacing a few of them on Friday. Odd that they would choose the coldest time to replace windows . We are waiting to do the front windows. They are the worst of the lot but they have a shade that can hide them. Hiding is the rule of good housekeeping. A brief sky this evening. The days are stretching beyond four PM. I like the trend. Recommend a series on Amazon Prime if you have not already watched - \"As We See It\", easily binged in one night! It is about three young adults living together , all on the spectrum, all endearing and funny. It is a great watch and I guarantee a happy ending. I am such a wimp these days. So emotional.

It is a far cry from a lotus and has earned the name of \"A corn\". The people of Saigon think it is quite the joke, and it is. Last night I went to bed earlier than usual so that I could get up at 5:00am , make coffee and pot stickers, ready for a tour of Trubetskoy Bastion Prison, the beginning of a Russian revolution series presented by Anna, whose tours are always fascinating and well documented. A few of the folks well known  imprisoned there : Vladimir Lenin,Trotsky, Gorky and everyone's favorite tragic guy, Dostoevsky.I got all settled in to learn more from Anna, blanket wrapped around me, hot cuppa and a plate full of pot stickers.

So sorry for her, I sent her a tip anyway. -0-So it goes during these plague years. We have been lucky so far, but then we do not go out into the world very much. I went to the Pharmacy yesterday but the line of people needing meds circled around the building so, NOPE. The PAWS- for- a -beer seems all but derelict these days. The doggie playground void of toys and water dishes. I am nearly at the point of f*ck it all-   dream planning a trip to London just for a fix before I am too old and fat to waddle off of the plane. We are all impatient now, rather than scared out of our minds.

Some one in this house does not understand that just because there is substance to the coffee grounds ,  does not mean that they are viable, but damned if that person does not try to squeeze out every possible drop. Much like using a tea bag forty times  because it is still a bag. I open the Queens's sweets and am surprised ! They are quite tasty, fruity and not terribly sweet. I have eaten all of the mince pies...I will have nothing left for the celebratory snacks. Still have marmalade - will make scones- will scoff all. The new refrigerator is collecting a few magnets- This is one. I am so mad at diabetes! Dennis can not eat a damned thing.

It is fascinating about how the justice/court system works in the UK, The acting is good and the stories are great. What I would criticize though is the intense cello playing all the time erratically and loudly,  seemingly  searching for another bag of cello meth- I mean really, the music is absurd. Everyone walks very quickly, to this intense cello music,  with purpose, shoving obstacles out of the way, not  saying \"sorry\".

It is an interesting system. Solicitors do all of the work , like a prep cook- then the  chef  (barrister) puts it all in a pan , takes credit and a bigger pay check, solicitors worked to the bone.

At only four months old she can remove my glasses and stuff them into her mouth, she laughs and laughs at the surprise of small wadded hand suddenly becoming big spark hand over and over. She is teething and had her eye on the tortilla chips. We explained to her that the pain of teething will be worth it, waving a tortilla chip under her nose. We had so much fun with her, two grannies- old granny and young granny. Flora is so observant- like she is judging us as grannies, I think we passed Ok, we will see if that holds. the game!Just one more photo of Hannah at her wedding.Her tattoo is \"MOMS\" because she was raised by two mothers wedded to one another. It was the first same sex wedding I ever attended, before it was \"legal\"...Y'all remember that BS- have we made strides or just baby steps. Yesterday Jules died from complications of MS and covid leaving her three children and husband . She was of the Erik generation, so young.It was touch and go for days in ICU but then it was determined that \"go\" won. Virus continues to be a bitch.As I was out yesterday before I went to baby Flora's house, I thought I might give VV another chance,. That is the second hand so called charity shop where the manager told me to watch my language...you might remember that dumb day.I got this book at V V a while ago and really love it, The first photographer of dogs in a comfortable dog way, being real. Ylla was an Hungarian photographer in the forties. Anyway, I went to V V to see if there might be another good book on the rack, even though the check out machines and the new manager have made it a misery  to go there rather than a pleasure. I looked around a bit, the shelves are now  homogenized, all of the cool, funky  stuff culled. As I was looking through some books , I heard the manager come over to a little Asian woman who had her cart full.  He said to her \"I noticed that you put a thing inside a thing in your cart.\" That thing was placed in an open  basket that she wanted to buy.  She answered- \"do you mean this? I want to buy this\". He said- \"uh , yeah, you are not allowed to put things in things in this store....so I am just going to ask you to leave -right now\". Holy shit- what a damned nazi! Had she not been Asian and a woman would he have been such a jerk? I don't know but that was the clincher forever. I told Kim about this event and we decided that rather than just never going back to not only write letters but to go  fill carts full of stuff , say the bad words- she is going full on with \"FUCK Mother fucker\", and I will stick with \"shit,poopy, shit\". We will get kicked out of course, our teaming carts left in the aisle,  and we'll  probably end up on their surveillance   but the satisfaction of that is just too tempting. We do not go high when they go low because we are too childish , care to join us? Probably not...You are a better person than we."},

This was Hannah's wedding, unusual in that she had her brother and Erik be bride's men, everyone could wear what they wanted . Flora Jane in the middle of a hug , girls all grown up and tattooed.Flora , new born, looks like she just landed and does  not know if this is the right planet...She is convinced now, though. Pretty much settled in. The bride's men and the groom's men , in their Goodwill suits, having a great time in the procession to the \"alter\"-  a simple, natural, affair.Sorry to have not been there to see all of the, now, adult children doing the thing. I would take Palm Springs over any wedding, though.  Oldest son and family spent Christmas there, hiking, eating drinking and when they got snowed out of Seattle they had to find another place to go so why not pop over to Disneyland for a few days.  Sure, why not.   They returned  well. That is what sunshine will do for you. It is a healer in measured doses. During climate change  I would rather be in cold wet climes than the opposite, We can always add another layer. There will likely be an exodus to the north as humans bake, but even that is no guarantee. The climate is wild, showing off what it can do to shake off the human cancer. Yep, I am one of those malignant beings and yes, I am going the way of all others. I conclude that we all just get by, get on with enjoying the company of whom ever we enjoy, eat a happy cake, observe. When my cousin died, he had sort of straightened out his affairs, at least in the immediate area- had piled his camera equipment in a nice stack,  probably the only thing that the tweaker had not stolen, put his papers and dealings in a brief case on the table, gotten dressed, sat down in his big chair  and let the lights go out. Nice.  These are the sunshine kids on a ten mile hike - Pinched all of these photos from FB because I am a slacker, a stealer of other's adventures at the moment. Here it is, a little Townes to put it all right. not cheerful."},

Crow shifted it a few times to set in the perfect position for a warm little cushion.  Yum, warm nuts. Shot from the kitchen window , power lines that have not come down in the storm, Canadian mountains  above the harbor, finding light! It did not last long ,though. The sky darkened and is about to dump  more snow. The deer think that there is enough  white stuff, thank you, looking for something green to eat....Across the way , the neighbor shoveled the drive, and then decided to shovel ours as well. We are now the official Old folks on the block. When we first moved here we were the youngins. All but two houses have turned over several times- people  don't really move from this neighborhood because it is a good one- they get old and die and that is how homes come up for sale. We could not afford to buy one now, that is certain! This morning peeking out to take a photo of the crow , the ice icicles dripped on my lens. They seem to be thawing quickly, before I can stir my gin and tonic with one.Actually icy run off from our roof would not be delicious,  though the idea of stirring a cocktail with an icicle sounds appealing- all Dr. Zhivago, it would taste like roof , spoiling the gin, probably.  I will not risk it.-0-My cousin died last night.This was when he was  young , with pet skunk, Pepe. My cousin was most definitely a one off. Introduced me to The Doors,Country Joe and the Fish, Srgt. Pepper,  Grateful Dead, weed and speed, beer for breakfast, timing my VW bug, shooting a glock, lottery tickets and dinners in the rotating restaurant in Vancouver, BC.I met him when I was 16 and he was 14, My parents took us on a road trip to go visit the uncles around the country.- He lived several states away. He was a bad boy with his fingers in every illegal pie. He took me to concerts, the Dead and the Stones . A  fair dose of trouble over the years. He tended to follow me where ever I went-the bad penny syndrom. University, college, Nebraska, San Diego,  the desert, Port Townsend, Wyoming, and finally He ended up here nearly next door, On his boat in the harbor and then in a little condo downtown. Seems like he has always been within walking distance...anyway, his raucous life undid  him. I do not know how he managed to stay alive for as long as he did. Danger man. If something was shady or sketchy he would order the lot, and for dessert an entire truck  load of fall down drunk. Sad , in the end,  stroke and a brain tumor took his mind pretty much, and then a tweaker moved in with him, stole everything, dismantled the sprinkler system and started a fire, He  lost everything to her. everything, including his teeth. He refused help- right up to the end- told the rescuers to go eff themselves and leave him alone. Like I said, he was a one off! Outside the law outside of any sort of  norms - if there was a rule you could count on it being broken, and if there was a lie handy it would be way better than truth. But, he was funny, irreverent, and generous, enough so that having him around was not terribly 911.All is quiet.... So, that is it , the last of my  family-family, whittling it down. I am the last man standing of that generation. No body left to call. No one left to pick a lock and enter the house to \"fix\" something or to leave hash cookies on the counter for a surprise an hour after ingestion.  ( I had no idea the cookies were loaded, what an afternoon that was, please- no thank you!!! Dear lord!)House is quiet. Just the boring are left. Could be a case of saving the best for last, if boring is \"best\", we are it! I am Ok with that."},

It is coffee...We were talking about wool and moths and she said \"Oh well\" , \"You just have to toss it all in the garbage\".

But they do not last long enough to dine on our coats and Norwegian sweaters- Dennis is wicked with the zapper.

An individual human existence should be like a river — small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and over waterfalls.

A nice reprieve from downpour, we are glad.  I went to the post office for the last ETSY time, closed up shop not just for the holidays but forever. It was a good gig while it lasted, now the new and improved tax bill requires all who make over 600 dollars A YEAR to  file income tax. It has been, for online sites like Etsy and Ebay and Ruby lane, etc. $20,000 a year before needing to  file income tax. So, OK, adjustments will be made,looks like a few garage sales at the storage unit this summer - a one time- deals only-dumping of the Golly shop! I have hung up my Golly apron after twelve years of selling buying selling buying, searching, traveling, markets, searching , buying , selling. It has been a lark. One by one passions have been made redundant- no more travel, no more searching markets in Amsterdam and far off lands- for cool stuff to ETSY. No more felting on a grand scale, no more painting anything larger than what can fit on my lap, no more studio. Life is shrinking. Standing in the queue at the post office, a large man stood so close behind me that I could feel his belt buckle- even in the best of times that would be way too close.\"Excuse me, but you are  too close\"  I said. He said \" Oh, so you feel uncomfortable?\", \"Have you been vaccinated \", I asked . \"Hell no\" he said- \"Ok, then Very much YES I feel uncomfortable\".  He had back up, the guy behind him said, \" It's all hype, and they be tryin' to take our freedoms\" - I said no more but gave them a look that you never want to get because it wilts nads- they backed off and became quiet. Nads wilted.It has been a while since deer babies have been in the yard, Two showed up this afternoon , all fluffy with their winter coats on. They look very healthy and ready for it. They are on their own now. Their Mother got sick and died. Christmas is creeping in- I am feeling it! I may even get a tree this year and watch  the needles drop, poking and pricking through  socks for weeks and months, as they do. I always say \"Never again\"-  I never  listen ,  who knows, this could be the  very last Christmas ever.  How is that for optimism? Maybe a live tree this time If I can find one. It is slim pickings out there in shopper land.   I went to the Mediterranean shop to get food stuff and Turkish delight for the neighbors and for Erik's stocking. Lebanese sweets, Yorkshire Gold , Belgium chocolates- And For Dennis Keto Man , Jars of chicken stock and lard.  Poor guy, life without treats is possible.... pointless, but possible and he is making it work for him. He has all the clothing he will ever need for this life time, and the next dozen. He has all of the everything's  under the sun - buying for him is challenging. Gift cards do not work either, he lets them expire or waits until after  the business has gone belly up. At least a jar of lard will be something to unwrap, and will bring JOY. Gorgeous wreath from Dennis's Mecca- Cost CO.here is this for fun: LINKI want to go to the Pink Pony Club!"},

That is this particular  corridor of Wyoming! The wind in between those two towns is always dodgy, something to do with the way the mountains funnel air into lickety split  hurricane  level speed. Howling forceful wind is a constant there- I may remember one summer day in all of my childhood when the wind did not blow madly. Or maybe that one day is a dream...It could have been 45 minutes and my memory has made it into some thing grander                                                           -O- I waited inline at the post office for two hours and fifteen minutes, two clerks -an ad in the window- \"Now hiring\". The postal system in this country has been thoroughly  trashed, in case you didn't know...Folks  quitting their postal jobs due to abuse and demands. We all take a hit. On the way home I stopped by  V.V.  to wander through other people's donations, I find it relaxing. I found a gofun Japanese boy , got to the checkout where I generally have pleasant conversations with the checker. Checkers  gone, replaced by machines and complications.This changes everything. Part of the appeal was the eclectic - tattooed , rainbowed ,pierced ,  purple hair or green or fuchsia,  joyfully young checkers ! Always fun! Now, however,  there is a \"Suit\" in the front of the machines keeping watch as people struggle checking out their purchases. I muttered  \"shit\" to the machine as it rejected my card several times, the suit came over to me and said \"watch your language!\"       I wanted  to rescue the Japanese doll more than I wanted to treat  the Suit  to my  full blown colorful vocabulary, so I stuffed it.Behaved in the manner required to shop in the   new/improved/scuzzy/soul sucking experience of V.V. Dang, there goes my meditative space, my cheap entertainment.The Japanese gofun baby doll may be my last  V.V. purchase. The universe taking care of my buying/hoarding tendencies, with a big NOPE. I drove further down the street to Michaels to get art supplies,  finding that  the entire store has been  closed for over  two months  due to fire. There have been homeless hooligan  arsonists  lighting businesses on fire for the past four months. The shops not closed already due to covid 19,  are being torched. Why not torch V.V., then? Make it count, hooligans!  On the bright side, Flora's nice round head and Mama's nice round Mam .  All is well in her world.

Young women have been educated in the ways of  ancient mothers,  \"witches\",  Grannies, midwives and doctors and know what to do. Many have been schooled.  However. there is the idea of a  brigade out there measuring women's bellies and behaviors all too ready to toss them in the slammer IF they show up suddenly with less roundness. For fuck's sake- fuck off, and mind your own fucking business you fuckers. Fuck, at this rate I am going to run out  of fucks to give more quickly than I fucking  thought. Some weirdo  fuck head Christian in Texas (of course) is building a \"Maternity Ranch\"- not unlike the old unwed mother's homes of a by gone era. Not  a new idea, but the novel thing about the RANCH is that the woman will have their own tiny homes and get to be with their babies for a year- who pays? I guess, daddy God, that is what the genius woman who came up with the idea is counting on. And for sure the women who have their babies there will automatically become part of the flock, hefty strings attached, I would say. Kind of like selling women and their offspring  to their god army.

She texted some photos on IPHONE.  It seems like a very quick trip with  very little adventure because they were mostly drifting . Able to go ashore for a bit to buy essentials, like Christmas stars, but for the most part - just a boat in the river. It was a fabulous trip , so she said. However, her husband came home without her. As they disembarked tests were given and my friend tested positive. Spent the night in a fancy hotel to test again in the morning, oops, positive again. So he flew home to go to work on Monday and left her behind in the fancy hotel where she must not go out until her test comes back negative or until she becomes ill. She is not terribly distressed over this news- she said the Hotel is amazing - beautiful Switzerland , wonderful food and an afternoon wine /cheese offering for her in her room. She is in no hurry to come back. I finally subscribed to Disney +, just to watch \" GET BACK\" the 60 hours of Beatles working on their final gig. It is a lot of BEATLE...and some uncomfortable moments of YOKO sucking the air out of the room , trying to be relevant, George being his insecure self.  But ,you know, they were all so young and so talented and it was that special  time in our cultural history. The process of putting music together is amazingly intuitive, work it until  - ta dah- it clicks.  They performed on the rooftop above Apple studio at the end of the DOC, lovely , bitter sweet, credits roll, leaving us remembering  their remarkable lives of wonder and what we, personally, have been up to since 1969 and how the lads really did love one another deeply and how folks would ask \"do you prefer the Beatles or the Stones\" and what a stupid question that is. Apples and oranges. Anyway, if you have  hours to kill and have the patience to hear the fumblings and repetition of songs you well know, then I would say it is worthy, delicious with depth and understanding of the fab four and ,of course, nostalgia."},

Civilized old folks discussing the young while the young  hang out in the kitchen talking (shouting loudly  and laughing loudly) who -has -the -most -enthusiasm competition. Not sure all families are as loud as this one but I will say this one will make your ears numb. This morning I woke early to go to Berlin, a somber journey to view the East Side Gallery of what is left of the standing wall and the artists who have made it a beautiful and provocative monument to terrible history.  I took photos with my phone from my computer. Not the best way to transfer photos.                                                                                                           This is a work by an artist who titled it \"God is here  and she is A black woman\"     Immediately after the Berlin tour I went to Brussels Christmas market.The photos are iffy in the first place taken with an Iphone through pouring rain, iffier still after running through computer and then my Iphone, But you get the idea, Brussels - festive and freezing. All masked. The Brussels Market goes on forever and is  a disco light show on magnificent buildings. Raining, cold, but welcoming just the same.  The waffle stands , my god! And Chocolate Hammers!I  appreciate BEAMZ taking me out of this limited small life every morning at around 6:00. Pretty much a life saver. I always tip big, and have yearnings. I am sure you know about the brand new variant coming from South Africa that defies  vaccines, borders, masks - death is it's best friend.I will not be hosting Christmas this year, our house is too small and I do not have the energy nor the will to do the whole shebang again, plus too many dogs and too much volume.  I am not sure if Covid -stay -at -home- has made me more  sensitive (intolerant) or if it is just being an old ex animate, likely both. Nothing quite like being around young folks to let you know exactly where on the totem you may be. Anyway, it is the kids turn now, though  impossible because none are settled, nor will they ever be I am reckoning. That is my hope for  all, Do not settle. Anyway, one is graduating from Art School in Savannah and already has a job lined up in Wisconsin to ART for a big corporation, one has turned down a full ride at medical school in Dallas because he hates Dallas- going into research instead, one is graduating any minute now and can take his education anywhere in the world , so Great!- get out of this country, Granny advises...And the last one still wants to be a pilot like her Dad,  but will finish her masters in Education just for good measure. All are of course remarkable  exactly like your grand children are, generation fabulous! Looking out over the water through the water. Rained all day with an intensity that makes driving a challenge.

Traffic- unreal- my vision nearly 90% blinded, dilation ,darkness, and headlights, ARGH! I brailed my way home. It felt very dangerous.  -today going to the coop to get Waldorf salad makings - at the corner of the middle school  there was a stand still  line of  a dozen buses and  parent's cars  carting children away for the holiday. I sat through at least five lights. Not complaining, it felt festive! Kids excited and the cheery yellow buses made a grand parade.  Entering the coop, lovely harp music, the poor freezing girl ! She was hired by the store so did not have her hat out to collect tips. effing brrrr.I bought all the stuff - came across these NEW apples from a local organic farm up near  the mountain. They are called Rose something or Pink Pearl. In England they are called \"Surprize\", because the surprise is not so much the color but the remarkable flavor.  The kitchen light does no  justice, the apple is more pink than salmon . Beautiful little apple- mighty tasty! I went to the Assistance League on the off chance that they were open, Since  their usual day of being open  is Thanksgiving, they decided to open today.  I am psychic, must be! I bought the tea pot- 75% off of $4.00. It is signed on the underside and was made in the 70's. Oh lucky day! Adorable pot, right price, eyes that have not  yet slipped into wet blindness, a pretty apple, harp music in the freezing cold weather and a string of golden buses.

Wait a minute, My computer's clock says A quarter to three A.M. - telling time in the dark - 2:30 sure looked like 6:10 to me! Anyway, I was up, had tea and breakfast, checked out headline news of the day, sorry I did that- Christmas parade mowed down by some insane angry  guy in middle 'merica! I went back to bed to lose that vision in dreamland fog  and start fresh at a more reasonable hour.  After second breakfast I went to PT, like I said, and drove around for a while. I decided to go by Erik's kindergarten/pre- school. It looks the same, Little kids on the ground floor, big kids upstairs, and workshop in the casita. The bending tree is gone and the trenches have been filled in. The plum tree is gone- the tree where Erik and Hannah became best friends \"giving plums splinters\". It was a fly -by -the- seat- of -their -pants school and a little bit chaotic, \"Alternative\"  Co-op. Or so they claimed. Anyway for the most part it was good for Erik except for the day one  unruly boy nearly decapitated him with a shovel. I drove by his old high school as well, they are close to each other and both are  \"alternative\". Erik never did go to Public School until college just after his second year at high school.. What a great program, kids can go to college for two free years, if they qualify.  It is called \"head start\" because that is what it does, he got all of his GUR'S over and done with and ready for transfer.

Now that the leaves are gone it is pretty  obvious .  As large as a small car!I guess when it is dark all the time, the clock has no knowing...6:10 or 2:30 it is all the same, and on I go into my winter dither.

Little wonder it won prizes. I tried to order the book, the poem by the same name , by Christopher Reid.  It took a while to find it online, as it has been sold out on  all of the usual sites, at last I found a used copy somewhere in England , the book was inexpensive - the shipping made up for it. It should arrive  sometime between the first of the year and the day I die. Not holding my breath.Our lunch of seafood chowder was not quite as poetic . Just Stella and me and our usual.

Stop showing off. \"The tone  set , theme, atmosphere, I splashed home ,  plopped down and watched \"A Rainy Day In New York\" , the film that Woody Pedophile tried to pawn off a couple of years ago during the exposure of his  nasty pedo willy crimes. Because of the law suit with Amazon , it has finally been released. Do not even be tempted to see it, it is so badly acted, so poorly directed, lame story line, replay of every  Woody film ever made, but more of a parody  due to its tired lame Woodyness,  the usual Woody wank - old man and girl child.

I did not come away empty handed but surely  you can understand why... Puppets!  Very old handmade mache puppets of wolf and a girl with two faces.  They are in remarkable condition considering that puppets rarely make it through the first few of their shows - I reckon that these were used for a play once and then put away, forgotten. The wolf has a real grey mink tail, velvet suit- a dapper guy!The Mexican puppet is common but what is uncommon about this one is that he is brandishing a six shooter- Girl turns her other face , surprised, facing the barrel . Screams her silent puppet scream with that other face - wolf is aware  and charges  to  the rescue .All is well, Wolf looks terrifying to bandits. The Mexican puppet got tangled in his strings- I am waiting to work up the patience to unscramble him- not good with tangles. More of an  \"EFF this\" kind of  person.

In another billion  years we won't even  have a see-able universe. No fault of ours, just the universe expanding, doing its thing.  Plastic - of little consequence- and a clean uncluttered house- MEH. Pstshhhh, not even.

He said\"ha-ha, thanks for your concern, I am eating all of the candy , the girls might get a little bit...\"  NO NO I say- it will kill you!!!  Anyway, another life changing DOC. Having unplugged from social media  and 24 hour news , I am coming back to  being more  even keeled,  watching \"good stuff\", feeling so much better about riding this life out on the back of a charity shop leather horse. Oh, and you will notice that Freud had to get in his two cents...Of course he has a tale to tell about little Hans a four year old who was afraid of horses.  Freud made it about  the hugeness of  horse penises, and the \"sexual caresses\" from Hans's mother when the child was distressed at seeing a horse.  Anyway, Hans made it to adulthood , having been  analyzed by Sigmund when Hans was not much more than a baby .Hans grew to be a fine man anyway , they say. Sigmund sucked on a lot of cigars (penis shaped) , as a consequence, aggressive , painful , horrendous cancer made him fairly miserable for a few years- He died from injections of morphine- probably the smartest idea he  ever came up with.         “There's terrible evil in the world.\"It comes from men,\" said Holly. \"All other elil do what they have to do and Frith moves them as he moves us.

I just watched \"The heart of a Dog\" By Laurie Anderson. Utter poetry!  I listened to some Lou Reed, since the theme around here is darkness... and some obscure music from another planet. All the while, taking photos for etsy but it is too dark so - nevermind that. This morning on BEAMZ , Mark took us on a tour of Miuden , along the Vecht river. Charming! Last night I went with Nathalie to Guy Fawkes celebration across from  Parliament in London, of course. BEAMZ is bailing me out, my wanderlust somewhat subdued- the tours are sometimes hilarious but always informative and loose. Nathalie invariably has a run in with the law. She is such a pip! This time she had made a tiny Guy Fawkes and while in the small crowd across from the House Of Lords, she lit it on fire. The law swooped down on her like a pair of hungry hawks. She apologized and assured them that she had no gun powder and was not Catholic. All is well. I shifted the granite ware  , in its place on top of the hutch I put the baskets that were on the floor. The top of the fridge  where there is a hole that was a cabinet- removed to accommodate the new fridge now has the large granite ware and the two enamel roasting pans on top, in the hole, making it seem less of a hole. At least things got dusted. I took photos of the little wooden French Sabots to list on Etsy.  As I said it has been too dark to take photos , accidentally this tiny wooden dolly took a seat in one of the shoes - \" That works!\" I will not list the bad shots of the shoes now, They are good  dolly holders. Going through some of Erik's left overs - this note holder of Sigmund now sits above the screen where Sometimes headline news is visible.The original MOFO. Back in the old university days I did take a  basic psych class- Sir Sig's BS. Dark age so called education, I had to take a few more psych classes for my major but was more careful about the sort I chose- One quarter I took something like \" the Psychology of Primates\" - monkey business which made way more sense than Freud's  \"Penis Envy\" and \"motherfuckers\",(The Oedipus complex, a theory that suggests that every single person has deeply repressed incestuous instincts for their parents since childhood.)  Anyway he holds notes well, this little thing made from a clothes peg and rubber. A sometimes useful gadget, holding notes/ reminders/ grocery list, and commenting on headline news. Oh, and for those of us who are disturbed by things crooked, the painting above the mantel is not really crooked- it is the wall that is crooked - actually the whole house is crooked. Probably why I am disturbed most of the time."},

And so- I have gone ahead and reserved 13 days in the spring for Dennis and I to go to the desert. Dennis in Palm Springs ? TILT! But, by then we will both  be craving the sun and a change to our cold  thick pea soup existence and who knows, anything can happen. Life does surprise, sometimes pleasantly.

Nellie built the Palm Inn - initially it was for the infirm as Nellie's husband was a doctor. They divorced, he went to San Diego and she stayed in her beloved desert, built the Inn and catered to Hollywood rather than folks with infirmities.  SUCCESS! Shirley Temple had her own bungalow there. Everyone loved Palm springs from the get go.  The park imported  grown palms and other growing things, sculptures, a police station, and a cultural center as well as water features. Cost 7.5 million dollars or more , small for a park of 1.5 acres. It is right downtown, surrounding \"forever Marilyn\" close to  the entrance of the museum. It is beautiful though a bit weird as parks go. Lots of desert dirt. In the airport on the way home Stella made friends with this little beggar. Crumbs from her lemon bar did the trick. Back at home, in the wee morning hours, a pile snoozing on the deck. \"Did you miss me\" I asked. They did not respond.This also happened, His name is Arthur Evergreen . Lisa and Christianna wanted a family. They used the swimmers from Lisa's brother and Christianna's egg. They made the perfect child and he is really smart already, right out of the oven and he is ready for university! I swear this is true.He and Flora are destined to be best friends.

Otis wins again!November is for hiding out, sleeping through the long winter, emerging in the spring looking emaciated and desperate , and so the circle goes. For bear and Raccoon it is just how they do. For people , not so much. A thick frost this morning- chill to the bone, no amount of fat will warm us  ( though I DO give it a chance)- no amount of sleep will reserve our energy. We just carry on, pretty sure that a nomadic life would be better than staying put. I am not a farmer, no reason to remain rooted, I say- Remedy is only a two hour flight....just sayin'.However...I did interlope a condo owners meeting while in PS. poolside - disgruntled folks regarding the \"board\" , who are reluctant to invest any funds into the safety and well being of the inhabitants . The under belly of paradise. Always something, you understand. Humans being what they are-  primarily self interest trumps consideration for \"we are all one\".  Humans can never get that idea right can we. Is it learned behavior or just who we are?.  Children's general unfettered generosity and inclusion - besmirched by the time they are seven, in school, competing - grades, who has the best lunch pail, who has the best sneakers, who gets the most attention either positive or negative.   Our survival depends on it I guess, like Otis's depends on having eaten ALL of the salmon, able to outlast other bear-  other bear's  well being?- phhssst. Human and bear -not naturally magnanimous , I guess. Anyway, glad we do not have the lifestyle of Otis- we have a new fridge coming on Wednesday as this one is dying a slow wet death. Served us well for way too long! Ancient thing! We will continue to stock the new one with all sorts of food/treats to get us through the winter- (new fave is cranberry /goat cheese from Cost Co. ) The five pounds  lost in PS found me within three days of being back here in the freezing cold NW.So it goes.

Glad they came along, though it was sneaky.Most of Palm springs is on leased  tribal land- the lease runs out in 2060 at which time the desert will likely be uninhabitable due to Earth shift, lack of water, you know, the usual climate change dilemma. Anyway, i will be well and truly gone by then so IF I ever became a snow bird and had a slice of the PS pie, the lease running out would not be a consideration. Going into town at night , walking around entertainment in the streets - great food/margaritas. Like any Disneyland for grown ups, I reckon. It is a touristy sort of place that does not seem touristy. There is a freedom and friendliness about this place, acceptance of all sorts.Dennis asked me just now how it is that I could come back  healthier and what I could do here that  would make it like Palm Springs...duh...\"take more holidays to Palm Springs,\" I replied.  It was hot but do-able as there was a light breeze and always the pool- here is the Pool Queen in  her reverie, thanking the sun god.Stella.The orphans with a hand out from a guy downtown- it is for  home delivery of anything hemp.  The gayest city in the USA, though at this point I think many cities are in competition for the title, this city just happens to be a safe haven. ----\"Would you like a piece of Rock , Mr. Candy?\"---(Lucy and Ethel.)

Let's cancel some more culture- we KNOW misogyny and this amazing fabulous Marilyn is not it. I adore this sculpture because it is exquisitely  adorable  magnificence , utterly Palm Springs Spirit!- Caught the sun behind her head, a perfect halo. We praise thee Saint M!Perfect sunshine might be another thing great about Palm Springs- Not kidding about dry heat, It is heavenly and likely to make cancer on the face of a way too white , water logged, under ground mole woman- but does she care? Nope. She bloody well baked  lying there snoozing.Walked a few steps to the heated pool every morning and afternoon. Stella used the pool for hours upon hours every day.Stella, Queen of the pool! Came home brown as a raisin, she did. Maybe, too, is the friendliness of folks  . Even the homeless were a happy lot, We counted nine homeless in the ten days that we were there. Stella gave them cookies.For some people, the night life might be appealing- the cocktails that cost $40.00 apiece at the Tropicale. We were not those people. We were in bed by 10:00  PM or earlier and $40.00 richer.For sure - the toilets are worth a mention. Drinking  water all day- what the desert does not rob from you - must go somewhere. What may be so special are doggie doughnuts in a cute shop..Doggies everywhere, welcome everywhere - like how they do in France. Dogs are people too, they just have to have a human to pay their bills. Or , What's so special could be the weirdo growing things with nubbins and stickers...pom poms at the tops of ninety hundred foot poles...Spiky things and trees that grow lemons the size of footballs. Cute plants are everywhere - like alien beings who might be watching you, listening to you, tracking you, I dunno.  I am a bit suspicious of them.i wonder about  things going on in desert nature...sexy time perhaps? Looks like it might be... Depending on what you determine as sexy. Clearly this is!There is a sense of humor about Palm Springs . This , at a cross walk ,  is a metal storage thing for street emergencies.Most of the cross walks have a button to push for when the light changes in your favor. Some yell at you in a gruff insistent Man's voice, \"WAIT!\", he demands! Then when the light changes he shoots you with a machine gun- \"TAT-A-TATTAT\" and counts down the seconds that you have to make it across. My favorite one said \"QUACK\" instead of \"WAIT\"There is a statue of Sony Bono in the square that is  so unbecoming and hilarious , we thought it was homage to  a skinny old toothless guy. Really bad statue for Sony but pretty good for a skinny old toothless guy.Palm Springs might also be great for getting new legs- These are Stella's new legs. They are blue and interestingly proportioned , art legs for wobbling into town.-  finally  this photo of where we stayed , taken during winter time- sent to me from  the manager, who was the most delightful person , overly generous and good. She greeted us with a fresh bouquet, two enormous chocolate bars, a tin of biscuits, a bottle of sparkling grape, a pair of Happy Lucky Cats,  and everything you could possibly think of for essentials, as well as cold drinks in the fridge, tea and coffee. There are more \"What's so special\" of course, I could probably add a zillion photos but I won't because I reckon you just have to go there yourself.  We have already booked another stay next year... I could also say that it is good to be home- but I won't because that is a lie."},

Guess I might have to make some  curtains or get a high powered pea shooter -not sure which is more trouble.Today is a wet one. everything is melting- I splashed through  town to take a dress to Emily for a wedding on Sunday, the day that Stella and I will be in the air. Sad to miss the wedding , another one of Erik's besties getting married. She was a child that called this house  her other home as well- I saved her one time using the Heimlich maneuver, though I had no idea what I was doing- it worked and the lemon drop shot right out of her mouth  and hit the pavement with a bounce. WHEW, Not today hard candy child killer- not on my watch you don't.  Anyway she is getting married and Erik will be Bride's best boy- wearing a suit and a smile, and I will miss my darling Hannah getting married, my boy by her side, and Emily holding  Flora the raptor,   getting emotional from the sweetness of it all.   Just as well that Stella and I will be in the air because I do have a most unappealing weep. I would embarrass the children, as usual.Wet, soaked deck. The animals don't mind at all, they just carry on as usual. No complaints.Remember the little raccoon who came to the door with a badly damaged eye and a hole in her head? She showed up this morning- Pretty much blind- feeling her way around and  limping , using only one hand to pick up the kibbles. BUT she actually looks plump and shiny and healthy in spite of her injuries. She knew where to come for breakfast - the others had gone back to the woods. It has been four months since  last she was here. I thought she likely had died. Then the wind toppled  a large pot full of dying flowers, Big boom, the raccoon scampered away- a three legged scamper, terrified. Damn you WIND- no body invited you to  blind raccoon  breakfast.I have managed to pack- not sure what I have packed but it is done and my bag is by the door, Perfect timing wouldn't you say- trip to the hot place a reprieve from this typical autumn in the north . Palm Springs  weather forecast is as you would imagine- effing perfect!.  We will be bone dry when we return and ready to rethink living in the PNW.

And why are the so called conservatives upset about billions when - \"The debt ceiling needs to be raised not to pay for future spending, but for past spending, including the $7.8 trillion the Republicans put on the national tab during the four years of the Trump presidency.\" Brain explosion- if those numbers were represented by something tangible  like in Polar Extremes by Nova   where carbon is illustrated dramatically by using brickettes dumped from the  back end of vehicles and factories and and and and.  If I could visualize $7.8 trillion  in red headed orphans , maybe I could understand better.Last night we watched  NOVA about the four planets closest to the sun.

Ok this all old news so why the big push to get to Mars?  Haven't we done enough damage and to what end.  Who do we think we are? See, this is why I need a holiday free of all thought. A gin and tonic by the pool , a walk into downtown under the relentless  brain frying power of the sun.

Salmon friendly waterways are opening up under freeways and roads, creeks have been cleared and cleaned. I hope it is not too late. There are also salmon hatcheries being developed to feed Orca only.

Out in the boons, sandwiched in between two towns close enough to get groceries , arsenic and hatchets, but far enough away to not be nudging elbows with other hicks. The price is really low, totally affordable , knocked down quite a substantial amount from what the assessor assessed. We had to see for ourselves. It is beautiful out there and it is trump/ hat on backwards/ 6th grade education ville. If the land was good though, all of that yahoo stuff would not matter.  We could build a couple of tiny homes , lakeside or in the forest, use it with the kids or without, for a little get away.There was no access for us to wander the land- I went as far as possible through  creeping maple vine and stickers- on the uphill slope. Golf ball , why?Grizzly chew, again , why? That stuff will kill you!and cheap , nasty Rainier beer shot by a 22. In my opinion Rainier beer is good for that one purpose, target practice. Of course if we shifted out here we would have to tote a fire arm- looks a little methy in spots. Small price for 27 plus acres and a lake- this is the  reason- wetland, REALLY wet, wetland. The uphill slope was damp , the rest of the property was hip boot wader deep.  This would be our boat...This was as close to the lake as I cared to venture.We went back to town to the Assessor's office, and ask our questions. The answers we got were satisfactory enough for us to hang that 27 plus acre idea out to dry. When we got home I google- earthed it - from above it does indeed look like Waterworld salad. A crusty green swimming hole with a four inch plot of land to build a tiny house upon. Ideal for Mr.Toad and his pals, they can have it. Anyway, we at least got out on this sunny day- looked at the cow wildlife , sucessfully social distancing, cows are smarter than people. We saw  a few wonderful barns. That was that.  Tomorrow is another day. We are going to a birthday party for Dennis's ex wife with the kids, the ones who can make it. We are going to a brewery, which is so appropriate, as nobody drinks  , except for the kids...whose bright idea ??? Let me guess... \"Suspended on Wet Glass\", installation art  by Peg.She is changing color for winter, I had to google it. Her bright white freckled with the softest grey. I want to hold her, but - not wise, probably.  Yesterday was senior day at the assistance league- so I went late in the afternoon not expecting much -it was an outing- and I am procrastinating really well. Really good at it!  Clean, organize, maybe tomorrow, or the next day.Anyway,  this woven mask for a couple of bucks. looked amazing.Google told me that this is  a \"raccoon\" made by the Wounaan tribal women in the Panamanian rain forest. Generally they sell for hundreds and are not taken lightly. Of course I would find a raccoon!Of course it would be somewhat sacred. It opens its mouth.I also had to google this sugar bucket - Firkin. Firkin sounds like a cute little animal but  is a measure from the old days, to weigh  sugar and other things that required measurement, the buckets then became known as Firkin. This one is Pennsylvania Dutch, so google tells me. There was no sugar in it, bought it anyway for $4.00 because of the cuteness factor and I think I NEED it, sure I do. \"The basic numbers are as follows: There are 8 pints in a gallon, 4.5 gallons in a pin, 2 pins in a firkin, 2 firkins in a kilderkin, 2 kilderkins in a barrel, 1.5 barrels in a hogshead, 2 hogsheads in a butt, and finally 2 butts in a tun\".Then the German wooden doll (whose fallen off legs I repaired) picked up a sailor. She is an older woman, he is just a young thing. Both wooden, I could have sworn I heard the clacking of wood last night. but this morning they looked like this...so...you decide.Whatchagonna do when the world offers so much cool stuff for a dime? I am  obviously a stuff freak and there is no rehab for that because who would want re-hab, I say NO, NO ,NO. Really though, I have done much  more catch/release and set limits .....wait , clearly I have no limit, I am a liar.  I will, however, give these two Democrat items to a friend who is political and loves Democratic historical items. That is my stuff for the day- and here is a pot in the morning sunshine, such a nice warm glow as the plants die- a light freeze last night.

He managed to stay alive after a long while in $$$hospital with doctors pulling everything out of their sleeves to save the lad. Mushroom growth tried to nudge the life from him but failed. The neighbors ex-husband had a perfect little mushroom growing in his skin- he saved it as a prize. It resides in a jar somewhere.This led me to the info hyway to suss out mushrooms living inside the human body. Yes , it happens, especially with one specific tiny edible mushroom that grows in dark forests on fallen sticks.here is the video. I walked around this evening to see if anything was still alive after the storm of last night. Geraniums, of course, I love them they are so hearty- and little daisies that spring up without any encouragement at all. I took a photo of one of the things  retrieved from Anne Marie's pile of cast offs. You can see it is a single cup coffee filter holder. It has a tiny chip at the top, works fine but could not be sold. Lucky me. Some things just do not sell and here are two. I felted these a few years ago when I was still doing shows with the Weaver's Guild but - no takers. The only one that \"sold\" I traded for - it was a monkey head.  Everyone loves a monkey head- that is not creepy at all.  I use  the girl head as a prop for hats - the bird is entirely useless, both  take up way too much space- not  cool like the monkey. That is the downside of \"creating\" stuff- what to do with it?  I still have to sort my wool from the studio- it is piled up downstairs in a corner attracting moths I am sure. I lack organizational skills...and ambition. Guess I better claim the 12.5 million that is waiting for me with FBI agent Wray. Then I can hire someone to do it for me, like a boss.  Maybe Mrs. Williams will need employment when she gets out of FBI jail. https://themarmeladegypsy.blogspot.com/2021/09/postcards-from-lake-roadtrip-to-boyne.htmlA painting that Jeanie of Marmalade  Gypsy did during a workshop and study of B/W painting. I was taken by her palette and the  guy in the corner of her mixing tray.  Is he holding a coyote? Could be- I love accidents like this, so inspiring. Love the perspective and his tiny red head, even the background is perfect.  It is hunting season- truthfully I have never held hunters in high regard., how about in no regard at all. In Wyoming, the season drew trophy hunters, hide getters and meat eaters, from out of state and out- of -state  spells opportunists with little thought for the eco-system , the land or the culture of the state. Outsiders, generally disasters, dressed in costumes- obvious before they  opened their mouths that they just dropped in from Dudeland- arrogant, demanding and not aware of  hunting protocol  other than round up some animals  and shoot 'em.  Like fish in a barrel. I hated hunting season- the  thick smell of blood   in the air . Carcasses draped over trucks, high powered rifles displayed .  Heavy sad atmosphere and men- far too many men.I worked in a gas station one season- pumping their oversized  trucks full of fossil- and after a while I could no longer do it, I would send them down the road with a \"fuck you, asshole, go back to your pent house\".  Yeah, I got fired but felt vindicated. and kind of like the Queen of Wyoming, a champion for wildlife.Common knowledge that this is also bear season in that they are trying to fill up on berries before hibernation and they may  still have babies  to protect. Keep a distance , make noise to warn bear- which rather defeats the purpose of sneaking up silently on an elk...anyway, folks who do not know the dance will cause terrible things to happen. Report that a 45 year old man was mauled by a grizzly- turns out that that man shot the mother as she was trying to protect her cubs, killed her-  land management people had to kill the cubs as a result, The man is fine, a few scratches they say. Photo of the cubs taken earlier as they are a protected endangered species, Game and Fish and science kept track of their doings. for study. Wyoming! Don't go there with your damned ignorant arrogance- stay the eff at home. The \"incident\" is being looked into and I do hope that the man is fined so hard he will lose his house and truck and his high powered dick stick. Of course there are always people who go to Yellowstone unaware of what it is- it is NOT a Disney set up nor is it a Meow Wolf art project. The ignorant go to Yellowstone in droves- selfies with a bear while offering it a marshmallow, selfies with an irascible  moose or a bison- loads fall or dive into the pools and are rapidly cooked. Letting their dogs loose to jump into the seemingly inviting pools and  there you go Crispy critter. Wyoming usually rejects most folks on its own, the harshness of the land, the unforgiving wind and weather, rattle snakes and black widows- but still they insist on hunting and going to the national park- entitled.  \"This land is my land, this land is your land\" sort of idea.Fine, help yourself to a dip in the pool, I'll hold your fanny pack. My rant for the day as it is hunting season- and I am homesick.  Wyoming in Autumn is a potential  slice O' heaven,  hunters wreck everything they can , then go back to their where evers to boast about their huge packages."},

Before our adventure we went through the craziest car wash - started out all wrong as my friend just got an E car and did not know how to put it in neutral, or to take off the brake. We broke the car wash! They had to shut it down for a long time to reprogram everything and get back on track. In the end we got through the most entertaining car wash I have ever experienced. We decided to go south to a couple of charity shops - the orphans needed more animals to care for. SUCCESS! We drove through the valley and over to hayseed country. Nary a trump garbage sign - have they gone undercover ?  Have they been buried? Anyway it was great to travel the back roads looking at amazing old houses and farms. There are still some bargains to be had .The entrance to the car wash looks like this,  like entering some sort of second rate Disney after thought. After we broke the whole damned thing the workers there did not wipe the car down at the end. I don't think that they appreciated us very much.  Plus we were having way too much fun- the workers did not smile."},

I dropped him off downtown this evening so that he could meet with his friends who should all be in AA ,  ( an old mother's opinion, having forgotten her youth) at least he will take a cab home- smart that way. I showed him the new road and bike park  in town,. The area has been off limits for so long - GP toilet paper maker which is now defunct. Today there is life on that dismal old smelly property,  children and dogs  running around , riding over the bouncy dirt bike hills, installed  for so called fun, folks playing music loudly, dancing, drinking beer and smoking skunk. Nearly as good as the olden days except that nothing is free  and people dress better now. Party lights!Street art along the waterfront and the back  view of the granery and the museum never before seen from this angle. I took him along  the homeless \"RV\" street- folks living in vehicles  that might have actually worked a few years ago, some have  solid roofs. It has become a sort of community and seems to be branching out into the adjacent vacant lot. Anyway, he was impressed with his old home town- \"The air is so  fresh!\" \"The homeless are so civilized\". \"The traffic is little!\" If living in Portland has taught him a few things - one may be  that his old hometown is not half bad after all, another may be that his parents are not as impossible as once thought.  Seeing things from a grown man's perspective. He will be leaving tomorrow at high noon- Of course I would encourage my evil twin to puncture some Honda tires in the drive but that  would only delay the inevitable departure....so, a hug and a \"love you more\" and off he will go , down that long ribbon of hi-way into the shit hole that is now Portland.

In the morning ,on senior day, it is unreal- crowded, carts going the wrong way, wheel chairs, loads of walking devices, challenged hygiene. Though I am one of the elder tribe, I prefer to go in the afternoon, when Stella and I pretty much have the run of the place. There were bargains to be had.  We wandered around for two hours! How is that even possible you may ask- and I will answer that it is because  once the place has been cleared of walking devices, they bring stuff out in huge carts. Around and around we go.  Woo hoo , more different stuff. Much catch/release., it was  an entertaining way to spend the day.Who could not have thought this puppet was a good buy at ANY price- $5.60-  I bought it for Erik - only the best for the lad. Either he will look at me with some measure of anxiety regarding my mental state or he will thank me profusely because , wow,  cool puppet!  He sits well in the cigar chair and every time I come around the corner I see him and he makes me glad that I had $5.60 burning a hole in my pocket. The absolute BEST thing  was this little German doll made by Lotte Sievers Hahn, 1930 her legs had fallen off. I put them back on with wire and E6000. Shopaholics extravaganza! Decided we needed fuel. Went to one of our favorite Italian places but the menu changed and so did the prices. By a lot! Check that place off of the list!We went upstairs to another old standby . It is comfy. Seafood chowder and Cesar salad - decent.Looking out on the tree tops- a little lamp on every table., in the olden days when I went to this place- there was not a single person in the bar that I did not know- it was a great hub. Much flirting activity and Gin, a bit o' the weed, music, and , if the timing was right, a fisherman had just come back from Alaska and had a wad of cash  for several rounds. They do not serve CAT. This shelf  is false advertising. Erik is driving up tomorrow evening, i offered a flight but he hates to fly. Especially after that one time he was taken aside in the airport and told that he was acting too happy- So he is driving for 6.5 hours after work, up for the week end, a quickie! My mother heart lub- dubbing right out of my shirt- so excited to see him.Another thing that happened- because time is a trickster-  Flora is one month old  though she just got born five minutes ago. One month and she has already learned how to imitate a genuine raptor and to smile- she will go far!"},

Armageddon? No worries, I will have art!Watercolor requires finesse , I have none. Watercolors are not forgiving either, I need a lot of forgiveness- so I play with water colors, splash around in my own way- I do not demand much of myself- breaking all of the rules.  Looks more like the usual today out there in the PNW. I went to get the booster this morning, Kind of hilarious, bunch of elderly milling around rudderless, confused by the queue , puzzled about registering, filling out the form, trying to hear-  Anyway, there I am among  my peers getting the senior booster jab, rudderless.Driving there I thought I must have gone by the house of bacon- everything smelled like bacon, The pharmacy smelled like bacon, the post office smelled like bacon.  My car smelled like bacon. Dennis has bacon nearly every morning- it is like cigarette smoke - adheres to my hair and stays there. My cob web hair is a tuned olfactometer, gathers every pungent odor it can- Evolution perhaps- it is a secret weapon, a  scent disguise. to throw off the hounds- though bacon may not slip by them! When Erik was little I took him to see my parents,  while in the airport a drug sniffing beagle charged me- the drug officer was all excited- \"got one\" he thought, but the beagle was just after my hot dog, which he swallowed whole.  Sorry Officer Krupke- krup you. I was not reimbursed for my hot dog. No \"sorry, Madam\"  either, we were in Texas- a whole other country. Looking for nuts through the watercolor painting on the door, done by mud creatures from the forest. The little ones still come around- without their mother. They are still cute and playful. Time for them to be sussing a winter nest.  Mr. Bags scores a mountain of nuts.Another find from the  garage emporium. Done by Erik when he was 18 months old, I asked him what it was- \"Postie tokes\" , was his answer.  Of course, I should have seen that it was Postie tokes, clearly it is.here we be hanging on this mellow cloudy rainy day, Boostered and bullet proof, as Steve's Dave would say.  Nothing left to do but maybe watch more Vera on prime.

Of course it was a treasure hunt  for us - we came away with a bag full. Stella took the oblong platter for her deck plants- I took the round one.

Beautiful plump seeds falling like rain.  Ann Marie is about seven feet tall so, sunflower must be eleventy hundred feet tall , conservative guess. Stella and Ann Marie talking about how flowers grow and gardeny stuff. She gives us some magic beans.I will plant them. By Christmas they are sure to reach the sky,  we will climb up  the vine and gather the goods! We will all be rich! I should write about this...pretty sure it is original. In the studio where Ann Marie  works her coolness, I bought two things, a bee bowl and a circle cup. Stella bought a fish cup. Everyone was glad. This is a platter that is still drying, It is LARGE. Then Stella and I went on down the road for  more adventure. We were out of cash.Stella bought a two inch pumpkin - I took photos of vegetables that look like furniture- worked up an appetite- went to the bay for fish and chips. I had a cod sandwich for a change , delish-  Delivered in a paper box , I love the texture of the box. Looks like a sweater.A great day, as is every day when Stella has an idea! This is Ann Marie's barn, beautiful solar panels potential to light up the whole town, if they actually lived in a town.  I am not sure how they manage a farm ,  Alaska fishing business as well as massive garden and  a pottery studio .

It will take me at least a couple of weeks to clean rooms, floors, toilets, deck. I have become quite a pro slacker- no one ever comes here and I don't mind dishes in the sink ,  bark on the rug, grimy floors and cluttered surfaces. But, as the doors and windows close and the furnace comes on, it is good to have the detritus  tossed in the trash or sucked up into the vacuum cleaner. which also must be cleaned and washed.  Just so we can breath clean air if nothing else. Grateful that the 50's thing of being a GOOD housewife has gone by the wayside. I would buckle under that pressure. My Mother did not buckle.  Mrs. Clean ,perfect, heals , ear rings and lipstick to vacuum, cook , bake and have the neighbors over coffee  mid day- as well as a part time job. When she went to work full time she still kept up with all of the Good Housekeeping as well as bridge club and PEO. Clearly I am not my mother's daughter. Twice a year cleaning is all that I can muster.       At Cubbie's house  the apples are dressed in little socks to keep the bugs from devouring the fruit but I think it is also a modesty issue.

Not very interesting as color goes but who can resist a bottle bottom , rough edges smoothed by the sea. This is but a fraction of what I had collected. The tub full  went back to landfill  as , you may remember, I moaned about in another post. Some archeologist will dig it up one day and wonder how it got into land so far from the sea. \"perhaps this was tribal jewelry, wampum, burial objects, weapons?\"They may guess that is was all just trash tossed into the ocean and collected by a scrounger.  Of the collection of clear glass , these are my favorites- Pepsi, from Bellingham, a  large perfect  milk bottle top, a curly bottle edge and a tiny glass penis. Or mushroom if you like...to me, looks  more like a circumcised baby penis.  I fought against that barbaric practice , and won. Increasingly, good to report, fewer parents are mutilating their infant sons.\"It’s his body. Only he should have the right to alter it, and only when he’s old enough to have his own informed opinion. Give him the gift of his whole body – and the freedom to make his own decisions about how much of it he wants to keep.The foreskin is a normal, natural, healthy, valuable part of your son’s body. The foreskin protects your son’s penis and urinary opening throughout life. When he’s older, his foreskin will allow him to experience sexual sensation and function the way nature intended. He’s perfect just the way he is.By not circumcising, you’ll give your son a gentle beginning, help get breastfeeding off to a good start, protect him from unnecessary pain and surgical risk, and reduce your own stress in the postpartum period.Your son will grow up to know that you respected his wholeness and saved him from a damaging cultural practice. He’ll never have to ask, “Why didn’t someone protect me?” Instead, some day he’ll likely thank you!\"As with all surgeries there are adverse effects- it is cosmetic and not medically viable to scissor off the foreskin of a newborn. How barbaric we have been! The rational has been about smegma  collected in the folds , which I suppose could be  legit if the boy never learned how to  frigging wash...or if the family has some sort of  religion insisting that they mutilate their new borns-  that is god for ya.One of my friends had all three of her new borns circumcised because patriarchy demanded, Dad wanted the boys junk to look like his - the babies did suffer infections and pain. In adulthood they have less sexual  sensitivity, and somewhere in the recesses a memory of infant trauma.  But then, all was well because everyone's knobs looked like daddy's. Sorry ,  carried away- the stupidity/good intentioned cruelty of people mystifies...Ok-leaving you with more gentle beach finds- soft pink depression era is rare-  ceramic body parts are rare,  a large bit of amber depression glass is rare and genital mutilation is becoming more rare.   \"Hippie\" moms!  The new order!

I found a couple but none as lovely as she!The jars are full of Mary's garden and Mary's kitchen, and Mary's jarring skills! How she could part with this perfect bag I do not know but she absolutely sent it to the right home! Perfect size, versatile, Coach, long life! large Hardanger from Norway, I swear Mary must have gone in a time machine and scouted  all the land to find it! It is the best piece of Hardanger I have ever seen. Norwegians be jealous!In the postbox teeny tiny hand knit socks in a blue envelope  from Sarah arrived,  knit using fairy wands for needles , so itty bitty and so astonishingly well knit, a turned heel and everything socky.  LEGIT!  Pretty sure I could not be expected to wear them,  even on the smallest part of me, which would likely be a skin tag-so.... This is who  they are meant for ! Fit perfectly - It is a sock party! Just in time too, winter is in the air!  Such generosity and talent in this circle of friends.I thank you from the bottom of my heart and  from my bottom.  Love is BIG- bursting from my chest like a baby alien. I adore you, you know.Last week I went in to see what was wrong with my shoulder . It has been \"out-of-it\" for 2.5 years, physician said it was arthritis. She said WRONG! I have a torn tendon and frozen shoulder so will start PT when I get around to it. The other PT , for the diagnosis of arthritis , gave me the most wrong exercises to do.  Did more damage than needed, I knew it was BS- Trust intuition y'all , the medical pros are to be questioned. ALWAYS! The nurse at the shoulder place had just gotten over covid about a month ago but is still short of breath and weak. She was so careful and then at Christmas time she hugged and kissed and celebrated- and gave her children covid for Christmas. DAMN! She said it is as terrible or worse than you can even imagine. Said she shouldn't be alive."},

Another man cut in front of us  in a hurried manner, went over - both , looking down quizzically. There lay a woman. One man said \"she has been lying motionless for longer than normal, so I came over to check\", the other guy thanked him ,as he was a Doctor. The Doctor called the EMT, reported  that the woman had no bracelet or necklace to indicate that she may be diabetic, I was going to offer my opinion, that fentanyl is epidemic up here, but decided to MYOB , took Cubby away from the scene so as not to traumatize him and to not interfere. The woman was breathing,  though unresponsive , like a wet noodle that fell from the sky. Splat. On the way back home , a neighbor had set out  a wooden box at the side of the road full of newly harvested grapes. \"Please take\" the sign said. MMMM, sweetest most flavorful grapes Cubby has ever sniffed! I took a few gobs, ate one on the way home and saved the rest for our desert. It  has rained a light rain  for two days  , moisture is good,  we are headed for a storm this week end, supposedly. Strong wind and thundershowers in the forecast.  The power will undoubtedly go out. Took cubby back to his home , where things are going well and my friend is being amazing,   strong and so much better. It has not even been a week after surgery and stroke scare! She is a trooper. I worry that she is too feisty though, doing things she is not supposed to do- like climbing up the steep stairs by herself, clearing and cleaning in the kitchen, Her sister is arriving today for a couple of weeks and will make sure that she behaves...maybe...So glad to see that she is doing so well. That was a scare.These are a couple of tomatoes from the garden in the hands of the gardener. One of them fed three of us at dinner. Big as pumpkins!I am home now, a parcel just arrived at the door. YAY. What could it be?"},

It is  mild torture. They must keep their engines running to prevent dragging anchor, as we quietly go mad. The expense and carbon foot print is large- really LARGE.                                                                                  The freighters are huge  taking up all the bay space., burning up all of the oil.  The industry still has not recovered from back up caused by  the sideways ship in the Panama canal, as well as the covid back log. So there they sit ,  more unwelcome by the minute, The port is on speed dial in every home. There have been so many complaints about  the sound  driving us all mad that the Port doesn't' answer anymore.  I like to leave my window open at night. It is closed now so that the thum thrum has marginal success driving me crazier than  usual .  They have run out of space in larger bays, like Seattle ,so they have to come up here. Annoying,  thum thrum , thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrum thum thrumThe tide is in and the water looks fine- clear and clean and crisp, tiny  lap- laps - a reprieve from the heavy, heady freighter sound.Since I was by the dock anyway , I decided to go into the spa to see if there was an opening for a pedicure. Raspy , crusty covid feet  - as it happened there was a cancelation , I could fit in. GLORIOUS!!! The best part was that the doer of toes preferred silence as do I. I  felt no pressure to chit chat - just you do your job and I will do mine, which was to relax and let the massage chair go up and down my untouched for too long hunger spine. I appreciated the doer's tattoo placed on her forearm facing her customers - \" Be Still\" it said in cursive.I had a gift certificate  from three years ago, which covered the pedicure along with a handsome tip, parking was easy and the day , bright.  Could it have been better? Only if you ran up to me with an orphaned puppy and tossed it into my arms. The koi pond looked especially nice today, I only noticed the koi in the corner later. One came up to greet me, as they do. It had its fin resting on  dark partner ,which went unnoticed until i got home and unloaded my  camera .I was the only person . Water features making water music and soft flutey music playing through the air. If that is not comfort enough the fragrances of earth and wood with a hint of some mystical flower, refreshingly cleared the air, even through my high tech mask the fragrance  cycled in. The big dark square is the fire that isn't , but will be by the end of the month, Snow predicted! Dear lord we have waited, haven't we- this was a slice of heavenly pie, heavenly cake, I must say.  Next on agenda- Shorn locks. I have been scissoring as I go- taken off about four inches of hair and now it looks like  toddlers got ahold of me for their  beauty shop \"training\". For color I chose  clown orange, HAPPY feet  , scrubbed and rubbed ,  sanded , oiled ,warmed in wax and  softly  cuddled in  moisturizing boots. I swear it took all of my effort to wobble out of the chair and up the hill to my car. My feet -no bones- jelly feet. It has been a good day. Now , off to the grocery to get stuff to make stuff for tomorrow, if tomorrow comes. If it doesn't ,I  leave this existence a  happy woman with  happy  toes - all  dead folks will rave! Very pink aren't they? Pink as a  ginger in the sun! Pink as Easter ham!"},

Looking better , nibbling through the yard.The light is changing as it does in autumn, finding a ray of sunshine through an agate from the beach is something to cling to. through the dark days to come. Pale holly hocks eeking out more fragile blossoms -  it is raining, dark wet rain.  Welcomed to be sure! Another nap, other nosh- and that is how my days go.  I made oxtail /bean/veg soup for my friend and took it over, spilled a bit in the car , now the car smells like a deli. She is doing well, Her children still there, I will go over to stay a few nights and days when they leave.  Then her sister will arrive.I read Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor's book \"A Stoke of Insight\"  years ago, the story of her stroke and what came of it. A very good read -informative about how the brain , unlike any other part of us, heals. Calm, quiet, care, light thoughts, warmth, rest and sleep. Too often the medical profession does not take that into consideration, Too often they try to get the ball rolling as quickly as possible with PT and Ot and exercises, which  can slow recovery rather than help.  Too often they treat it like any other part of the machine. The medical profession is not about health - more about mechanics  than nurture, as we all are aware.  The medical profession in the states is a putting -out -the- fires sort of enterprise. We sometimes forget about nature, arrogant ,though sometimes, well intentioned  humans being part of it instead of controlling it. We are not in charge.  Give nature a chance. The waterfall does the weeping  for you when your tear ducts dry up."},

Little surprises in her garden placed here and there artfully. This is Tilly. She is a puppy , and needs some serious puppy school SOON! She is a lovely dog and she is a rowdy piece of work.  The sheep just look at her like \"Pshhhh- get real\". Tilly is a goof ball.Last night we watched \"The Sunshine Hotel\" highly recommend!  I had no idea of these sort of flop houses in the Bowery or who lived in them.  The documentary is so well done, the hotel managers and residents in the DOC are articulate, innovative, understandable.  They once were some mother's child."},

Alone out there with a new born, it was a great way to walk a baby and two dogs while finding cool stuff, like shopping but free.  By the time we moved to town I had collected a small tub full. It found its way to the dump one day by accident. This little pile is all that is left and the pieces here are not even close to  interesting but there you go.  I am glad that Dennis uncovered them. He also found four packets of spaghetti dated \"beginning of time\". Dry pasta can not go off right? I will try it and if it is terrible I will give it to the gulls who seem to relish all things terrible. sad lot from the beach, Dennis doesn't remember tossing out the fabulous tub of fabulous finds , just looked like trash to him- trash /treasure- all relative isn't it."},

Nuts are preferable , of course, raccoon family  also prefers nuts and grapes but, we heart tomatoes,  it all evens out- each one thinking that they got the best deal.here is a squash  that is not going to turn into anything  other than its blossom and vine trailing along the deck. All of the plums were aborted- because Mrs. Plum controls her own body and she does not live in the south.

Both Clapton and Pavarotti lost  their sons to early death - of all entities to consider, Mary is the one!  \" Holy Mother, hear my cry\".  I reckon  that Mary wrapped Conor up in her  universal feel good cloak of comfort, and the parents of course,  needing comfort and love for the rest of their days. In my mind I surround them with Mary, queen of the universe,  energy. Anyway, I listened to just about everything Pavarotti I could- then moved on to a few Il Volo, and then the documentary about Maria Callas.  I am not a religious person (no shit, jack!) but I  do have a fondness for Mary - I love the illusion , the thought and  myth  of her. I choose her to hang out with of all the Holy folks. She takes in orphans , she loves all children and after all - we humans are, pretty much,  children - we all require love. Even the horrible ones.

Conor's Dad found this magical place, set up the memorial with Laurie helping, getting word out -  it was all so quick. Is this really happening , did that really happen?  Did he really leave us? All still in shock utterly. Dandelion seeding, we used to call, \"wishes\"- sculpture on the land, wishes for good will.Totem, Nooksack nation. Ancient rough hewn cabin , toilets round the back. The speakers and singers and poetry readers used the porch as a stage - story tellers,  lovers, the grammas and grampas, brothers and sisters-All with the look of \"what the hell are we doing here-  REALLY?\" how can this even be?The ceremony was opened  on behalf of  the tribe asking for respect for all things. Laurie ,   dear friend and teacher started with a blessing- god was not involved, thank you.  Everyone nestled into comfortable seating, couches and plush chairs. There was ginger beer , water, blueberry  - raspberry bars and other nibbles on a large table by the photos of Conor's life and loves. Pippa . my neighbor , whose daughter Scarlet was engaged to Conor, read a poem in her lovely melodic London accent. She sang a song which I can not remember - made  me tear up quite a bit.  I blew my nose into my mask.  No worries , I had another. Michael ,Father of Conor then told stories in his lovely Irish brogue,  about how Conor got his name.A king to be named after !More stories  told by more folks in love with Conor.We  sang Joni Mitchel's  \"Circle Game\". Michael told a few Dad jokes , everyone groaned on cue!  It was light and wonderful though none of us can believe our lad is not in this realm any longer. More songs, Irish , some traditional , some newly written.Everyone sang \"Let it Be\".Rock and rollers rocked  us  out of there- some one has to fill in the gap  that may be left- the Stones are leaving- right?  (I'm Joking!!!) These guys were really  very good, though, and it was certainly nice to leave rocking and rolling. I went to the country store , picked up the best fried chicken in the world and  chocolate milk and toodled on back to town - empty gas tank, munching a leg, driving with my knees. The force must have been  with me. All day! Was a great send off  for Conor, but tell you what, death of a youngin'  sucks- there is no deeper grief, no more profound sorrow- hit squarely  when I saw Michael protectively cradling  the box of  Conor's ashes in his arms after the memorials last tune. Hearts shattered. Tomorrow I will go see new born Flora,  the seasons they go  round and round,  and the painted ponies go up and down. We're captive on a carrousel of time."},

Extreme in all things \"health\" but not medical,  and all things God messaged. Some of  the extreme craziness must have helped  him - he died just before his 97th birthday.  OR he may have lived to be 105 had he not gone off the deep end with wild quackery. Unknowable, but the things he did latch onto were head scratching coo coo dangerous. This book is in great condition and has some illustrations that are laugh- out  -loud bizarre, It has been decided  that it will be  destroyed  for the sake of humanity.

I harbor some resentment, but how can I- ignorance , a poor education, and \"god shit\" sort of gave the Dad an out. What can you do?The hoard has reached the floor layer, the GOOD stuff-  Found this little treasure, Mississippi Mud, Nutmeg, by Lee McCarty. Picked  it up long ago for 50 cents.  Why it ended up in the garage- because when we had one of our many floods , I chucked everything into boxes and got them out as quickly as I could-  stuff  got piled on top and obscured all that had been saved from the flood . In my panic to get everything out , A small child, a dog that wanted to escape, a parrot  and three  freaked out cats - Dennis gone- I have no recollection of tossing everything in boxes willy nilly- but there they were!   If I sold this little mud pitcher  it would not make us rich but could pay the water bill.  I will keep it, however, because I still like it and it is  a beautiful little thing to hold. Not much, from the hoard, have either us us kept. Still a long way to go - getting there. Making  space for the Chevy Bolt to winter inside- BUT WAIT- wouldn't you know , as luck would have it- just this morning on NPR the news of recall- ALL Chevy Bolts due to batteries catching on fire. There have only been maybe seven or eight that have fried their drivers but that is enough to recall the lot. New tech is never a smooth go.  Not great PR for electric cars to replace the carbon makers, is it. They advise to park it away from everything- just in case....Waving the white flag of surrender!  I give up."},

Gadgets rarely do.Plus the hose was clogged with algae and couldn't  get water to the plants. Gadget not hassle free.A newish baby sleeping in the front yard while mother was in the back yard, Dennis went out to water the crows and the baby left. I followed it to the back where it joined its mom.Whew, I am glad this little deer adventure ended well for today.  Unusual to have one so small at the beginning of Autumn.  Most certainly feels like autumn today. Wearing wooly shoes and a jacket-  it is the sort of inside chill  straight to the core that nothing but a forest fire could warm.  I slept unbelievably again- like a rock rolling through all dimensions . I might  be lucky enough to sleep through the apocalypse. Wake me when it's over, OK? Then we can all get on without this heavy heavy hanging existential WTF.  I could be having the first symptoms of frontotemporal dementia symptoms , like  Craving carbs- (I ate the entire loaf of farm bread except for the end bit), cranky, anti social, inappropriate behavior , moody, sleeping a lot-  for starters just  scratching the surface of that diagnosis- it is a mean one! . What brings this to mind is the death of Chuck Close, the artist of big faces, a remarkable man to be sure- his work is legend, however he did have this sort of dementia which is not a good sort to have if you want to go out in a blaze of  love and glory - More like \" Whew! Don't let the door hit you on your way out.\" Anyway I had to ask Dr. Google what this strange dementia is- you know how dangerous that can be, Dr. Google will convince you to be  having all the symptoms of every fecking disease ever invented. I made Dennis promise that if  I became  more crazy and  diagnosis is  ever  of that sort , he must  go up to the middle school , score some fentanyl and I will be out of here without causing irreparable psychological damage to my loved ones. Sounds  simple, right?  By the way, maybe  he didn't really promise, he just made a sound - a combo  squeak and  growl, which I took as a yes. Looking forward to Sunday because it has SUN in it- Saturday has been SAT  and slept through."},

We waited in line for an hour to get to the door and then only a few people were let in at a time. Nothing wrong with the stuff, all quality ! The prices were outrageous so NOPE . The house was full of bibles and photos of Ronny Reagan.From there we got on with the real business of the day. Feed store and farm stands.I bought a few things for a care package for Erik and  farm bread . These cucumbers were too large , passed on those. As large as plump melons, probably seedy. Bags of tomatoes a dollar a bag. Sweet  Garden candy!I bought a few  lemon cucumbers- delicious , eat like an apple, a hunk of bread- I am in heaven, a most simple lunch. All based on trust, and cash, no change available, Checks - OK but luckily I had a bunch of dollar notes. Kim ate a fig and two beans, I bought biscotti . Dessert after odd lunch. The house is one that Kim and I sneaked in to a few years ago before it was purchased and put back together,  built in !909 , the wood work inside is amazing- solid. We went through the overgrown berry bushes  and through the open back door. At the time it needed a lot of work and the back carriage house was about to topple.  We thought the asking price was way too much, $175.000 with acreage and garden, across from a hay field and cows,  and the most magnificent monkey puzzle tree, as old as the house.  We were dumb, should have bought it -of course we realize that now...Anyway, One of those books in the midnight library that we did not choose. We drove all over the countryside, A glorious day! We did not sneak into the house this time.  It has been brought back to life in the most beautiful way!  Far better than what two old Moms would have done.Last night at 6:00 pm I had had enough of the day- went to bed!! Holy cow, I slept until 7:30 am!  Must be the moon. The dreams were so real, I am not sure - I think that I tapped into a parallel universe.  The only weird thing that happened today was while we were waiting in the estate sale line chatting with a woman on the look out for fabric- unmasked , we assumed she was vaccinated. No, she was not, and she was sure that the vaccine had killed over a million people  and that it was just the flu.  \" Stupid \" , I muttered into my mask but Kim engaged. Tried to educate the shite -for -brains- fabric -searcher. Then six other people all masked and vaccinated got in the middle of the dumb assed woman's bidniz, sticking to her guns - all trumpy- Fox- propaganda.  Awkward.  We finally got inside where some were informed of the woman unmasked and not vaccinated, Everyone kept their distance from her.

More lovely, more time, more kid.  Texted Erik asking him if he is OK, tap once for \"yes\" tap twice for \" no\", making it simple for him to communicate with his dear old demanding mother. he responded that yes , he is Ok , other than the world ending...Now he is working two jobs just to maintain, demanding jobs - not brilliant pay. Only one day off to do laundry and collapse. My unsolicited advice is  as it always has been- enjoy the ride, take it easy, go well. He is not in dire straights - not really. I think it is  the age- his friends are on a trajectory of accomplishments- I missed the memo, myself , never accomplished much of anything consequential. I have never built a rocket, for instance, like Erik's friend, or become CEO of a monumental global company, like Erik's friend, or become a science professor at Yale, like Erik's friend, or  a world renown artist, like Erik's friend- the list goes on... My  personal accomplishments  -             um,              -still thinking........   But you see why Erik feels that the pressure is on?   Talented lad seemingly treading water - Maybe a stall, which I think is good in these uncertain times.

They are substantial dolls, ambitious for a child .  I only made one larger but washed her in the washing machine and OOPS!  killed her! Bernice will be buried with me in my tomb.

Through the window soon to be replaced you can see the drizzly day. The windows came with the house in the 70's . Tech has improved since then so we are \"winterizing\" the windows and may be able to see out of them for the first time ever. Most have trapped moisture in-between the panes making grey days more grey. The kangaroo sticker will never come off, I have tried.  It was put there over thirty years ago when my  Australian friend came for a visit. She brought little wooden wombats, a tea pot and her very ill baby. I made an appointment for her with our pediatrician but she refused and chose instead to hang amber  around baby's bed, and feed him only honey. (?) Then decided to fly off to Switzerland taking her very ill baby- he grew up OK but of course is deaf , has poor eye sight,  seems to be doing well in spite of a rough babyhood and a wacky mother.  Strong will to survive.This morning one youngster stayed behind .  She dragged the water pan with her to the edge to take a nap beside it. Full tummy, feeling secure. Smoky air pretty much gone now.  As the world turns, what to do with an old globe? Make art? Use for prop?Old Yugoslavia was charming. The people were so sweet and helpful , generous in the market, large festively dressed women offering hunks of raw bacon to chew on while winding way through the market.  ( I did not accept though thanked them sincerely) The countryside was  lush and gorgeous, train rides , mellow and slow. I like to remember it that way. Travel days are over!Down by the bay there are so many blackberries growing, every year they increase. It could be that people took it upon themselves to try to control them or it could have been the city but this was the only sign near the area. Do not eat spayed berries, that they have been neutered somehow makes them toxic....  Anyway after the first rain the berries lose  their flavor and get mushy so, not  worth scrambling through the thorns to harvest any. When I first moved here I went crazy harvesting all that grows wild along the roads, in lots, in the forest. I had a kitchen full of jarred summer. My kitchen back then was pretty much the entire house, I loved it. I have not had a kitchen in this house - a postage stamp sized room of cupboards with a cooker , a micro wave and a broken refrigerator. It is a dumb kitchen built by a man in the 70's. He must have been high.I will forego my annual foraging through torturous thorns to gather berries, not so much because of the warning but because of my inferior kitchen and  Mr.Man's health issues, No sugar in this house ever. At Cost Co he found Keto ice cream bars - for a sweet fix. They are actually pretty good , covered in dark chocolate. I am here to tell you, though , that they will contribute more roundness to an already  pumpkin shaped human."},

Anyway, it was a terrible time when homosexuality was criminal, but as time passed, during the event,  became less so. Still  ruined his political career.  The adaptation is a fun romp . Ben Whishaw plays Scot, Jeremy's lover, and he is a dish!  The fumbles of trying to get him killed are fairly hilarious, though  sad, if you really think about it. Dennis planted egg pant, he has never eaten one - was not sure what it was.Of course it will not mature, just as well, from the nightshade family and not to be eaten by one with arthritis. It is a cute little thumb. The flowers are pretty, Interesting little spikes under lavender petals with yellow jacket danger looking stamen. The tomatoes will not be any sort of grand harvest either.

Below the boys, the lily boys all plump and ready for action.The garage is still a hoard but a more guessable hoard. Dennis finding stuff that has long been under piles of whatever. Cans of paint that have rusted through , paint leaked out in hard puddles. That sort of thing. One Halloween Erik dressed as either a nerd or Gonzo, I can not remember which, he got these Gonzo glasses at good will .Dennis found them in a box in the hoard , as well as some gigantic teeth. Weird people live here/They are thick lenses, so thick you could make a bowl out of each one. I think that Erik abandoned this part of the costume rather quickly because...blind!  I remember many halloweens abandoning costumes early on for the same reason or some other discomfort. Now I dress as myself for halloween and have finally grown old enough to be scary, especially when I frown. I scare myself daily. When Hunter S. Thompson went out into the back garden and blew his head off, he had decided that he had lived for too long. Noting the pain that he was suffering and the inability to be  crazed \"Fear and Loathing\" any longer, life just didn't have a point, as if it ever did for Hunter.What would he have thought about how ridiculous our species has become now, I wonder.  \"No More Games.

Usually they don't come around when the door is open but this morning they were feeling confident.  Also I turned the sound down on my computer so it was quiet and mellow. Yesterday on BEAMZ we went to Amsterdam, this morning bright and early to Berlin. There is an empty pot on the deck waiting for dirt and...something. But this is mid August already so the likely hood of  getting  something planted is nill.  Dennis is proud of the zucchini, growing so  impressively straight . Zucchini is as rewarding to the beginner as are radishes. I am flower sitting for the next ten days. Janet brought her orchids over so that they would not get lonesome. Cubby went to the neighbors because he gets too anxious when he stays here these days. Not sure why but I have an idea. The last time he stayed here his \"pack\" was in trouble, he felt it I am sure, and just wanted to be with them to fix it. So ,now he associates staying here with \"something must be wrong\". The mother raccoon just now, opening the door a little further.  Getting close to being  people.  I may make little bonnets for them.

Congratulations! She is a natural driver, in and out with out crashing into the curb or knocking any of the cones down. Afternoon , Stella collected me and we went to lunch, the courtyard of the market place, sandwiches the size of cars! We could have split one and still taken some home.  Delicious and the best part, of course, was being in the company of our Stella. Catching up with this and that and planning our trip to the desert in October in spite of covid and the variants. I bought a new mask built in Israel for travel and 99% protection, they claim...it is the most comfortable mask yet, I trust it. Above is the courtyard, we, the only humans in there which is good, sat behind the lamp and close to the door. The wait person kept her distance, unlike servers that are usually all up in your face with personality and charm -invasively  interrupting during the meal and private conversation.  That is the most irritating thing about dining out  in the States I think, Poor servers depending on tips become a bit too aggressively charming. I am a generous tipper anyway, having worked the industry in my youth, I understand  difficult job and low pay.  However, I more appreciate England and Europe servers , who make a living wage and do not feel that they have to make love to you while you eat a damned sandwich. Across the courtyard is a tattoo parlor, which used to be a dress shop which used to be a tobacconist which used to be an antique shop which used to be a dog  paraphernalia shop. Usually tattoo parlors in this town are  punk and dark and skull and lizard with a sort of Eff the Effing world vibe. This one is charming and I would actually go here if I wanted to alter my perfect body with  imperfect ink. I say \"perfect body\" with a \"yeah, right\" smirk, mind you. Ink would only call attention to it.  Above is a pretty safe in the courtyard in which to keep pretty money .And this is our Stella by one of her lilies , double tall!! The girl has a green thumb, her garden is awesome. She is holding her pooch, Lucy. Lucy has had a difficult week- her cat  companion got smashed  by a crazy fast driver and left to die along side the edge of the road, The speedway at the edge of Stella's property is a terrible road.Then Lucy had to  get teeth cleaned when it was discovered that her teeth were in dire condition. Stella takes care of her doggy very well - it is just a thing with mini poodles to have poor dental problems. Genetics. Most of them removed now as well as a couple of abscesses dealt with, little Lucy never complained, how is one to know??The vet told Stella that , in the wild, in their wolf DNA, dogs will act normal so as not to become prey. Weakness, not eating or acting less than vibrant attracts predators. Lucy is more wolf than one might think."},

I do not ever remember making the Marlo dress , probably bought the pattern because she was cute.  I had a crush.I looked her up , Marlo today, and am so sad,   terrible plastic surgery. She had a nose job before she got the part of That Girl and it was nicely done. Since then , another nose job, botox. face lift, neck lift, brow lift and who knows what else. I reckon that folks in the biz are probably just addicted to the drugs that surgery allows- the drugs are mighty fine I must say. I had an aunt who had surgery every week or so-  she died with only a couple of organs left in her- she did like the drugs, the attention, the special care...mental! Usually there was nothing wrong with her, minor things like a blemish on her gallbladder or something...Anyway, she, like Joan Rivers, died of too much surgery. ( another reason to legalize opium , surgery not required) When I did sew a lot, I used the most simple of patterns and branched out from there adding my own  questionable ideas of how it could look way cooler. Simplicity patterns were quick, instant gratification. My friend , on the other hand, chose Vogue patterns which were a pain in the ass- but, you know, classy in the end, I suppose. She chose the most expensive, difficult to work with, fabric as well. She probably still has what she made in her wardrobe because it was quality- mine was more like a five year old got ahold of cleaning rags and stitched them together.  I had the best old truck of a machine- could sew through layers effortlessly. It was not complicated, like my Volks Wagon Bug- easy to deal with , straight forward.   Sorry I gave my sewing machine  away. I got a new machine and have used it a few times, I hate it. It is complicated, fussy and robotty. Now I sew by hand, it takes forever. If this coming up winter is anything like the last, I might just cash in my high rent robot machine, get a simple uncomplicated one and sew some rags together.

The book had nothing at all to do with Wyoming, colors or art so I am reckoning that the universe just  rolled a 7 for me- \" subtle , washed colors  that exist and surround me for miles\". Wyoming's colors -water colored wash at this time of year- sage green,  ochre, burnt sienna, robin egg blue, the softest pallet across miles of the  hardest most unforgiving ground, not unlike Mars. Few landmarks, a melding of earth and sky with no delineation- no definition. Space. If you would like to go to Mars, and can not afford your own Penis Rocket Ship, just jump in your automobile and drive to south eastern Wyoming.  Ages ago- stopping for a cold drink and a kitten on the way through Wyoming on my way back to the PNW,  soft colors, weather worn,  lifted from the ground up. Hitting the PNW in my Datsun was like being submerged in deep water filled  green,  and purple- purple air.

I puttered around all day, went to the creepy down town post office, I should know better but I was in the area so, ewww, I went there.  It's like a morgue and the clerks are grey blue, grumpy and the line is a snail. Yep, I DO know better, it will not change, ever. It has always been creepy.Got some organic veg on my way home- had soaked beans overnight,  I made a delicious soup/stew/beanie veg,  earthy and healthful, I am almost sure it will give me super powers.  Of course there was enough made to feed the world for a day so  is now parked in the freezer. Lovely and peaceful here, the usual visitors on the deck. Everything in the yard is dry as a bone- i watered a bit for encouragement really, not for a thorough soak- the soil going up like a dust devil when the water hit- like cocoa powder that refuses to mix with milk. Weird. We are tinder up here.Going in to get beets and carrots this car was beside me.This is the cutest dog , she says \"Hi\".  She was on the Neighborhood site, I do not know her but wish I did.  She is darling is she not? Not time yet to get another dog but I feel the urge coming on, especially since travel is no longer a thing- I do believe that Covid has got us by the balls in a tight  grip. No balls? well then, Labia. Take your pick.  I have a wardrobe of masks- I have even had to repair some already, and I just bought a new one that will go to battle for me- it was REALLY expensive. So, I am counting on it. While eating delicious beans-I bit my lip , hard! Now - looks like I want to kiss everything, all plump , pouty and  Dolly- OR like I lost the fight with a hammer. Anyway, it does not feel nice and of course  bandaids are not made  for this sort of injury. Why not? Somebody should  work on that- a void that needs filling for sure. Breezy, cool evening. All is well. Kiss me."},
{"title": "crow lunch, and big oops", "date": "Monday, July 26, 2021", "text": "Lunch on the deck railing with crows. They tag along after the gulls and squirrels and raccoons. I tried my phone camera just to see if it would be OK. It is not. So back to my old point and shoot canon, which does take better shots. Before Dennis went to the island he very thoughtfully put out a baking pan with stones and water  in it for the thirsty birds. I have only seen the crows take advantage but good enough. I have water on the deck for everyone else, Jays preferring plant runoff. so I keep the trays semi full. Still a drought here. I probably should not say this but I am loving the dry days. Blue sky, warm sunshine, oh yes please.  Still a few bits of lunch on the railing - will be gone soon. The raccoon babies showed up after I scrubbed what I could off of the deck from their muddy little selves,  raccoon detritus. I found this magazine from 1978 in a pile by the fireplace. It is an old HUSTLER rag. It came from a party I attended back in the day, a party favour from a \"Girls night out pajama party\" Weird i know. I also got soap on a rope in the shape of a gigantic dong. Anyway, not sure why I kept this truly shocking magazine, maybe because its the only one I had ever seen and i won it as a prize for best pajamas. , but now it has more  significance. One day, when Erik was about nine years old, Everything became very quiet in the house for a lengthy period of time. Erik was a chirpy child always making sounds, singing, humming, Rrrr-RRRring like a bomber jet. Rarely was there silence.  I looked for him. Found him- in the bedroom perusing this magazine, discovered in the closet under stuff.  Um...\"shite\", I thought, \"this is so wrong, I am a terrible mother\".The first page looks sweet and innocent enough which was the draw initially, I think. but under that page is , typical Hustler porn, dear lord. Full blown. We laugh  now and I have kept it because it was the first porn that Erik  ever saw. Sentimental that way...just to be clear, we are not a porny family, quite the contrary, this is an aberration to be sure.  AND that is why this is so funny. I don't remember having a conversation about it at the time, though, while in the Cost co parking lot one day,   a boy and his Dad, had the  so-called \"talk\".Dennis   tried to explain body parts and how they function and how men feel randy all the time  and how love and sex sort of go together...blah blah blah.  Then they went in to buy the usual Cost Co haul. Also comical because Erik had already  seen with his own eyes what goes on in the adult parlor...I would likely be arrested today if it were known, but I am pretty sure this did not make Erik a serial sex killer or anything,  let by gones be what they were. There will always be parental mistakes made."},

I could have changed my appointment to have the skin tag removed, not life threatening but is the size of a nine week old fetus and just does not deserve a life of its own, I really  do prefer to stay here by myself, Heavenly! Also Dennis is on the weirdest diet that is keeping him alive, however is killing me. So I have all week to put fresh vegetables and fruit in the fridge, a heart healthy alternative to his fat diet. My lipids are \"not good\". Ok, then, getting back on track without the fat and sausage influence . Tomorrow is a new day! I can get back to my hippie heart, munching nuts and lettuce and going barefoot . I can burn my favorite incense without someone gagging and pretend choking to death. I can open all the doors and windows without fear of a bug getting in or worse, a bird, or screwing with the heat/air conditioning system. I do not need a system- I need nature! Already I have had one jay come it and park itself on the ficus, I told him to leave and he did, I do not panic when birds and raccoons come in. They are polite usually. I found this old photo of my Melbourne kitchen and how I used to be able to eat bread a loaf at a time. Good times!  I am looking forward to getting my bearings- The kitchen is a battlefield right now. Both lives depending on what is for dinner and both lives (bodies) requiring the complete opposite sort of nutrition. No middle ground. I am on my own- no more humoring . Digging out my Moosewood and Recipes for a Small Planet- tomorrow I will go to the Coop with only me in mind. This will be great! On the mend. On the right track. Home alone!"},

Top quality hoard! Anyway, making our way through, The garage is still frightful but less so.After going to the doctor for this and that, I spun through Value Village.Great furniture complete with giant dogs for very little cash. A high boy in great nick , old dove tail drawers that slid so nicely- Seven bucks!  I came away with this dude. at first glance he looks mighty fine. Wait a minute- Strabismus eye, He cant see for beans! And another PLUS that convinced me to fork over three dollars for him is that he has a girl body under all that wool. Yep, BOOBS! Trans dolly to add to the orphans.So, word is out that The boys are going on tour, ( thank you Ms. Luna) They seem to favor the south this go around though they will be in LA. and Los Vegas, This \"likeness\" is a card i picked up on the street in Amsterdam that one time when Stella and I stayed in the crusty VRBO that was full of black mold. Anyway, Ronnie Wood fancies himself an artist . He had a show there which we did not see but these cards were free and abundant. I am not terribly fond of it and who  is that guy in front  playing pool - dunno. While at the doctor's discussing this and that , I got a blood draw,. The phlebotomist was impatient -she could not find an adequate blood pipe in my arm, had to use my hand- whispering under her breath \"old people!\" After that I got a shingles jab. About three years ago it was  the thing here to get the NEW and improved shingles jab. There were many on social media moaning about side effects , how ill they were from it , how it hurt like getting jabbed with a fire hot poker. followed by a hammer and food poisoning and the ripping out of internal organs through a skin pore. Hyperbolic claims , I thought, cry babies, I thought. I have never been effected by a jab of any sort ever. Well, folks, I am here to tell you, all of those folks were truth tellers. Yep. A fitful night, nausea, head ache, arm on fire, chills, dear lord let me die before I wake-  the nonsense of my other shoulder and leg on fire  seemed small in comparison.  no rest for the wicked. That is my take,  this is pay back... Ok so I paid, I am off the hook, leave me alone...There is to be another follow up jab that has been said to be even more intense two months down the line.  We live in such uncertainty - I could be dead by then...fingers crossed.Here is a bit of insanity for you, Republican nut jobs are saying that people who have been vaccinated for covid 19 are \"throwing off spikes\" God I hope so , I shall embrace each of them  in a fifteen minute hug."},

The deck post that you see is  a four X four  so you can see by comparison how little these clever babies are.  There are two mothers bringing their babies to the deck, One has four and one has three, They are sisters from last years family and seem to get along well. One mother has a large patch of fur missing, looks like a close call...the other has a distinctive scar above her left eye. The babies obviously have not heard the tales of raccoon hijinks and close calls- they romp and play and tackle one another- god they are cute!Dennis found this news paper article in the mystery garage from  long ago.  He was struck by the family adjacent to Erik and Emily , not experiencing quite the enthusiasm  required of the event.  The reporter got a few things wrong, Emily and Erik were four years old , they misspelled Erik's name and Emily was a princess, not a clown...She skipped beside Erik as best she could- he was a maniac on his bike. I made the bunny suit when he was 18 months old , he wore it until he was six. Not every day, mind you. From this age on,  he has had two consistent good friends, Emily and Hannah. Hannah is getting married in October and has asked Erik to be in her wedding, not as a groom but as a Bride's Boy. This is the most endearing honor ever. I asked if he would wear a gown, he said he would if it would not offend anyone. I reckon he will rent a tux and be normal for the event, I will miss it because Stella and I will be in Palm Springs for ten days, if all goes well. One can not count on plans from moment to moment.

I say why not.I picked tiny flowers to stick into the tiny salt shaker  by the  peaceful  globby freak sheep. Dennis is reading trivia out loud. Some sharks can live for hundreds of years ,what a drag! But then I suppose Sharks do not get old, they just swim around, eat stuff and then one day, BOOMPH- they explode.  At least dolphins get high, a life more interesting- they milk puffer fish and then pass it around the pod. everyone takes a hit, starts acting like folks living in Hawaii- laid back, floating, relaxed in the  ebb and flow.  A little bit of poison is rad, dude.

Ok, then, feeling a rush of sugar I decided to go back to the League just for a quick peek. Chatted with a friend who was shopping, she  just quit her job to take care of her ailing brother, two days after she quit, her brother went to hospital with pneumonia.She reckons he is on his way out  - he has been  scrimping and saving for over four years and will be able to afford the 8,000 bucks for burial, cheapest  pine box, cheapest plot, no funeral, no fuss. Death the umerkan way.Anyway, I did buy a thing,  Gofun  doll from Japan. Gofun means dust, ground from oyster and other sea creatures that leave pretty shells behind to make a gorgeous porcelain like substance, Better than porcelain, it has such a natural feel and color.

Perhaps that is just part of the deal, getting elderly and all.  Dennis found a hummingbird deader than a door nail in the petunias. I don't think it was suicide. I think a rascal may have caught it and decided it was too pointy to eat.Last year I saw the big Mama ,who died from Lion, catch a bird in mid flight and gobble it right up. So impressed with that girl that I did not even take into consideration that some little bird family is still waiting for their bug dinner. The baby raccoons are fun to watch, they play hide and SURPRISE!  Then they act all cool , walk sideways, roll and tumble.  They have no idea how challenging life as a grown up raccoon will be. I do not tell them.So...Billionaires in space- meh....Here you will see Elon's fleet of penis's waiting for their turn  to thrust  into the wild blue yonder. They dream, they are here to say, rusting into the ground. Speaking of which, I took a photo of Dennis's success at cleaning pennies. He left them too long and there was nothing left but copper crumbs.The photo turned out to be a video so....Still can not perfect photo taking with my phone.  Anyway, he took his hoard of coins to the machine in the bank to sort- $89.00. nickels dimes pennies and a few quarters.

I do not like to leave them behind.  After spending a good deal of time  amused  by other people's stuff, doing catch and release, coming away with  a few items, we went to the harbor to sit in the shade on the deck and have an expensive lunch.  Fabulous day with our Stella. We are planning a trip to Palm Springs in October. Came home, Dennis showed me his \"harvest\"....We are not going to survive the apocalypse, obviously.He is still fishing out hoard from the garage- Doing a splendid job! This is the stuff that was mine in the garage. Each item under an inch so, clearly , my problem of too much stuff is NOT in the garage. It is everywhere else, and when I see old  photos of darling forgotten children in the charity shop and actually think about going back to  bring  them  home -I realize that I am mental.  The mind of a hoarder? I had a friend in elementary school named Sheila. Sheila was a large girl with a gorgeous blond thick braid down her back and cute dresses.  I loved Sheila. When She bumped into an object, like a desk or the wall  because she could not navigate very well, she apologized to the object and said \"s'cuse me , Mam,\" as she tipped her imaginary hat.

I had doubts that the garage would ever be cleared, not until both of us  clocked out - the kids  cursing us  for leaving behind so much trash. Anyway, Dennis has uncovered some things that are amusing-  art work- ancient dental supplies, a stash of coins that need washing.... While they soak he texts the kids  , while sunning on his deck farm, his thoughts going to a green house to house the plants over the winter. That won't happen but it is a  nice thought. Uncovered his Naval reserve photo from when he was a teenager  in HS.  After graduation  he was offered a good deal to carry on in the navy as a petty officer- set for life, however he weighed his options sensibly, went to school after serving. He is a clever person, he could have done anything under the sun especially at that point, went into medicine and decided that to have a family , dentistry was the best option for the hours and time- became the best restorative dentist in the universe, no exaggeration.The navy served him well. He was in airborne - became a pilot  stationed in Guam. Grew up pretty fast and loved every moment of it. It was a time of relative peace so there was nothing to do but fly planes and learn stuff and hang out with his buddies. Especially - the LADIES! I don't think he ever had dated or had a girlfriend., and then all of a sudden! Boobs in your face! He had his first sip of beer and first pizza. A whole new world!The only boobies he had ever seen before were in the national geographic , like most boys of that era. He had never been anywhere other than the country store .  A right Mayberry boy. Dug this program out of his treasure pile! A lifetime ago- about 64 years! So, that is clearing out the garage- There have been some questionable things emerging , some keepers but mostly goers. Whew, so glad to see it go. maybe for the first time since we have lived here ( 33 years) we can park a car in the garage.

Not sure what environmental impact this developer might have , or IF he will be allowed to finish his horrid project of townhouses along the creek. Already he has done much damage to the salmon run along the creek, trying to build on squishy land, collapsing the shore, foundation of concrete sinking, sinking, causing more issues, trees uprooted and falling.  If the townhouses do get built they will be a disaster to those  unaware buyers - the squishy land that is sure to topple their million dollar abodes, By that time the developer will be long gone, the damage done will be - done.This morning I popped out to see if the car's light had been left on all night, It had not , the sun made it look like it was burning.  Oh that clever sun!Took a quick shot of the succulent which is taller now and has flowers on the tips. Weird  looking plant .I thought I had made ferry reservations to go to Orcas soonish- Good thing I checked because I had not! The ferry is a damned hassle these days, too many people/tourists going to the San Juans, I am a  bit possessive about this area , I realize I better get over it.

He wrote stories about orphans of which there were many in his time.He did grow up very poor and worked in a  rat infested dire blackboot factory when he was a child , helping get his father out of jail, and helping feed his siblings and his mom . He was not an orphan but he knew of many, most of the workers in the factory were orphans who had  short miserable lifespans. He grew up and made loads of money writing stories , living in this fancy  house for a short time, walking the streets of London , sometimes 20 miles a day, taking notes.  It looks a very nice house - though his marriage was not what he thought it might be, he left the home after only two years and got a teenager girlfriend who he kept in another house to avoid \"tsk-tsk\" and scorn.He even has a bed in his house for the  dying orphan Jo.  It is not a happy bed like ours is.But the real non fiction Orphan Queen , the one who  birthed the adopter of orphans, lived long time ago In Wyoming. The adopter of orphans has kept a sad photo of the queen of orphans in a drawer. This was taken the day after  the Orphan Queen's mother died in childbirth , the baby lived to become a foundling of sorts. The man holding the infant was the infant's father, he gave the baby to an evil woman who wanted a slave child. The slave child died in prison after a while. The Orphan Queen also became a  child slave to the man in the photo. Until she ran away, regretfully having to leave her beloved  little step brother behind. She ran for her life. The man in the photo had a gun and he shot at the boy absconding with the orphan queen. The rescue by the brave boy made a decent impression on the Orphan Queen.  The man in the photo then poured battery acid on all of the belongings that the Orphan Queen had in her closet. She was free. Later, when she was old enough, she did marry the rescue boy and they did have a family of orphan rescuers.  She did find her step brother after long time when they were both elderly, He still had red hair. And they still loved each other fiercely. Both have now gone the way of Jo, in happier circumstances ,though, and  It all ended well , except for the prison baby, he did not begin well nor did he end well. We honor her courage and loving spirit  every Orphan Day...every day is Orphan Day in this house! The Orphan Queen never spoke of her past life- not until her children were all grown up and on their own did they find out-  from  other family members  who told the stories. She gives us courage and an appreciation of all things lovely!Her little brother and the new baby both had red hair, like us. Folks with affinity are probably the best kind of folks."},

Water will be the thing in the future that seems not terribly far off ! Next we will be checking out rain barrels and the best way to collect the manna from heaven. When Erik was in school, an alternative high school , emphasis on environment, they made rain barrels - I was not interested at the time, wish I had a few now though. The fawns are so frisky this morning- they leap, kick and run circles around their mother.

We were thinking it would be Ok because we sent air conditioners down with the lad when he was here to pick up  the CRV.  We  also felt secure knowing that he could jump in the CRV and come up to a cooler house if he needed to.The power went out in Portland- meth heads stole his catalytic converter over night....There is no such thing as  security in this world, no matter how well you might think you have prepared. . He did work on one of the hottest days, kilns firing, heavy lifting, no air conditioning, no air.  Yesterday was the worst of it, temperatures reaching 112- east of the mountains it was 120.

The sun freaked everything into a fried stupor.Lettuce, obeying the sun.Refreshing blues in shade, backing away from the sunny deck, Gimme shelter!Dennis bought tulips at cost co. They are perfect and totally match the print that Stella gave me.Inside the house it is tolerable, I can not complain. Though I will say that when the sun blasted out of the sky today it was not a friendly sun- it was an eff you sun!The intense sun going down left ,with  the same attitude- eff you some more- trying to light our house on fire.  After dark, when it had cooled to 1,000 degrees, I finally checked our metal -hot-as-an iron-poker- mail box. Sent from Russia for the twins, scruffy cloud  bear resembling our usual sky, dark  grey and soft, roasted all day in that oven box.  Now that he has arrived  something else must leave, that is my rule lately, maybe....  anyway I successfully got a box load for the Assistance League ready to go.  Been watching \"Hoarders\" just to reenforce my commitment. Since we dumped just about everything except blog world and Etsy, I have been looking for freebees online. Amazon Prime offers an abundance of watchables. \"Hoarder' being one, Flea Bag and other worthy programs. I watched a very quiet film last night as well , IDA, VERY quiet - poignant.  It is black and white ,  compositions of light / shadow are stunning, the story most compelling about a girl taken to a nunnery catholic priestly orphanage when she was an infant. She knew of no other life until a surprise showed up. her aunt was still alive , everyone else had died in the holocaust, though Ida knew nothing of them  or from where she came. Then the life lessons and adventures began ! It ends well with  profound resolve. Bear, twins, both look in a state of shock.

Warm (hotter than hell) weather makes me cranky and i just want to tell the whole world to shut the Eff up- Matt Hancock , British health Minister gets the boot for a kiss- the orange gass is starting his revenge hate tour, the Florida building was reported three years ago for structural failure -there is not enough ice cream on the globe to satisfy my  cranky hot angry  hunger this day. I moved everything to the shade, watered it well at sun up- so now they can boil.  Deck soup.Yesterday before the heat became insane, I walked down to the little street library to drop off a few books.

WEED and not the comfort kind.These hot summer days take me right back to being a kid. At age six I got a JC Higgins made in England skinny tire  girls bike from Sears. Green. No training wheels, just get on the damn thing and head out! This was the epic , life changing moment of childhood . On my bike all day everyday until it  felt like  my own self with  faster legs, I  conquered the world! Freedom - \"come home when it starts to get dark\", my mother would say. I liked the challenge of \"Don't go across the tracks, stay on this side\"- of course I went across the tracks ,where the streets were hard  dirt and the feral dogs  chased me , bit my tires and tugged at my pedal pushers.  Horses roamed freely and rattlers  sunned themselves on the side of the road. That was fun!  Way more interesting than our quiet middle class neighborhood with everything measured and trimmed. I rode out to the cemetery- I rode up to the park and mountain view, over to the penitentiary, to the fair grounds.  I took it with us when we lived on Snowy range and rode it down to Crows camp- hot sun, burned to a freckled crisp, I rode it on  overgrown logging roads where the bear lived- no fear...at all.  In a state of grace.  I kept  and rode my bike until I left for Europe at age 26 and stored it in a friend's shed. Lost my bike to a thief.  Obviously  I still think about it. My parents had no idea what kind of terror  child they had until BIKE!  This is what my bike looked like,(from the interwebs)-pretty basic. I have not had another and the place where I live now is so hilly I would be walking my bike most of the way.  Anyway, those days are OVER. I am left with the best bike memories a girl could want in this life! Thank you Sears and Roebuck.  If you are in the hot zone right now, Lie on the floor and dream of your childhood bike and the snakes and bear and feral dogs that you are faster than -  Conquerer of all of the things!"},

My wealthy- from -Texan -oil friend invited me to go to the after party/reception, because obviously I could not afford it . I went -noticed  right away how out of place I was. The  women there, wearing girl tight  booby frocks with high heels and inches of make up, bejeweled ,  giving me the disdainful  one or twice over.  I thought I had  arrived at a Phylis Schlafly rally.

She could not have been more loving and gracious. (swoon). This is one of my warmest memories and  most favorite photos.  After snapping this with paper-I did not stick around, couldn't get out of that situation fast enough. Surreal- Did those well coifed tight assed women even know  the history ,the woman, the movement?  Don't think so...Anyway, the book is a good read if you are searching for something substantial and have not read it already. Gloria is 87 this year , still the sharpest pencil in the drawer.  The Champion! What a time , in our human experience , to have been living in  woman's body , mind and soul!

I was confident that when the Nazis came I would be overlooked- I had the best hiding places. I worried about my brother, he was a large child, hiding not an option, but he could charm his way out of anything- I only worried for about three minutes, as I emptied my piggy bank of year long savings into his hand because he smiled and asked nicely.The nazis did not come- until recently, and they came after my boy. He did not hide or charm- oh hell no , front line, with his principles and kind heart. His \"cop knee\" has such consequence - permanent damage- as if he needs a reminder, right?  he had to take time off of work due to knee injury, nearly a year later ( the bastards).Horses and nazi cops will do damage- the difference being that one has evil intent and, of course , is human- the other just does not want to give Dennis a ride.Go well, Y'all, into this glorious summer."},

They were unable to keep everyone fed and clothed - selling magazines in SLC, door to door, but damned if he was not looking for another wife- preferably young, as his other wives were- sixteen. He had his scope fixed on a young girl. One of the son's, who was still a child, said that she was his girlfriend- hmmm ,who will win this little lass? Turns out that neither did because the big daddy was fixing to get arrested...anyway all of that to say that all of his little wives supported his pursuit of more wives saying that \"he just likes the feeling of falling in love\"- I can think of cheaper ways to get high that don't involve marrying a whole bunch of children and having a whole bunch  more children, like 4,00000000000 of them- though I do agree that falling in love is such a feel good. So is opium,  which does not involve much more than a floor to lie on, but it is illegal. Probably because it does not produce 4,000000000000 potential tax paying temple supporters. I dunno- no god ever told folks to smoke opium for the good of his realm, oddly god tells folks to make more humans , you know, for the afterlife planet that big daddy will be the boss of.  Dumbassed god- if you are asking...Anyway,  1985 -there we were- all shiny and new, future so bright Dennis had to wear shades."},

I was tempted to get one for the lad when he was little but got a wagon instead, more his speed and a Big Wheels trike, which he flew off of the deck - so I kind of guessed he would not handle a baby jeep well. Dennis bought a tray of coleus plants and stuck them in with the tomatoes, They perked up and spread out - very happy. One  blossomed.Wait a minute , coleus don't blossom.Looks a lot like a purple nettle- because that is what it is. Then the orphans took down the \"No vacancy\" sign and wouldn't you know, another one showed up! Just like  *snap* that!Harper rode in on an elephant, the others picked her up at the station.After a rest and rubber band spaghetti with filings ,  Harper and Nat decided it would be swell to go for a midnight ride across the wide, dark, piano. The other's had a slumber party. Not much of a party, it was mostly  slumber. The twins whimpered a lot about going with Harper on the  elephant ride, No one objected, mostly because they were asleep but also because the twins always get what they want. This is the tall yellow thing today. My Dad used to grow Glads in our two- month- growing -season, He was a master green thumber. He grew everything in such a short period of time. His Glads were LARGE and unbelievably beautiful. Plump blossoms- so if this is a Glad, doing it's best, it's best is not a ribbon winner. Maybe it is a lily, in which case, I apologize."},

Neighbor boy went in several times, phoned them more than several times.

The heater came on and I am wearing a jacket in the house. I don't really mind the cold weather, suits my Icy  heritage, but when the sun comes out warming me to my core I  do consider moving to San Diego- the most consistently perfect weather on the planet. Then I remember why I left, my GOD the traffic!Traffic is getting pretty chaotic up here now. Peoples tanks are being siphoned in the dead of night. Another good reason to have an electric car. This town is not the town I moved to- I don't like the changes- becoming overly  populated, expensive, and the buildings put up overnight are instant ghettos. Cheap ,badly  designed,  though much needed, apartment blocks with the character and appeal  of hardtack. This thing looks like it landed from the mysterious tic tack that has made the news lately. Only needing   goggly eyes and the ability to glow in the dark.  I suppose there may be a flower in there somewhere- It looks like it is listening to everything we do- suspicious. Just now , on the cold and rainy deck.

So now the lemon and the avocado have been made into sticks - managed to save the fig tree by scooping out all of the coffee but not before leaves turned yellow and began to drop . Seems to be snapping out of it now. I don't think it was entirely the coffee that murdered the lemon- there is evidence of spider mites along the thorns, Poor lemon. Who would not be cheered  by bright marigolds?

Milly lifted the front and Toot lifted the back , gave the snake a  snake cracker  and a nose boop to take his mind off of  the eggs . They hauled him far away-  all the way to the other end of the sofa! Toot read , just last night ,  that Octopus have large brains and are smarter than orphans - she brought  Sarah's octopus along to figure out the smart stuff. Octopus can do math but there was no math involved in snake capture. What to do with a felted snake is still in question but for the time being, he is being held gently and told stories about other snakes who have not been  so lucky. Felted bird is on the eggs at the moment.  One never knows, felted eggs might go well with Spam - the felted eggs would be the best part of the meal, no doubt!

BBQ ginger chicken, mandarin orange avocado salad, wild rice and Mai Tai's . like a normal gathering, normal conversation , all a bit shell shocked but not needing to discuss it, just a knowing. And the funny thing was that we were all ready to call it a night at 8:30 pm!! Crazy!The back yard has acquired a dog house,  they are using it for a little buddha temple . The Laughing BuddhaMost Westerners, though, think of a fat, bald, jolly character called \"The Laughing Buddha\" when they think of the Buddha. Just where did this figure come from?The Laughing Buddha emerged from Chinese folktales of the 10th century. The original stories of the Laughing Buddha centered on a Ch'an monk named Ch'i-t'zu, or Qieci, from Fenghua, in what is now the province of Zhejiang. Ch'i-t'zu was an eccentric but much-loved character who worked small wonders, such as predicting the weather. Chinese history assigned the date of 907-923 CE to Ch't'zu's life, which means he lived considerably later than the historical Shakyamuni, the true Buddha. so that is who is in the dog house  at the moment. Ch'i-t'zuSpring green throughout the garden - glowing- If you do not believe in magic during springtime , well I just do not know what to think !  Green green the rushes grow.The back yard has a wild feel . Actually everything was planned so well that it looks like nature did it all by herself.The happenings for all five of  the party  goers have not been especially pleasant this past  covid year . For one of the couples  it has been hell, and then some more hell and  then deaths of  both of their Mother's in their house timed just  a couple of months apart,  and family leaving in a grief huff of blaming the other.   Another of our party getting beaten up on the street waiting for a bus in Seattle, so badly that  his leg, face and eye socket in three places were broken, may lose an eye, and NO they did not catch the guy and NO the people that witnessed the beating did not help our fallen friend.   No reason, just- SEATTLE.  One  of our party was  banged up in an accident - falling down on pavement face first, and  then her  housekeeper lost everything to an online dating scam of a guy, literally leaving her at the alter with massive bills , no money and no where to go. One day we will laugh...they proclaim ,in the face of it all , we will laugh. We are  still breathing, and that is a major accomplishment. As a finale I dug out my little covid journals from my bag  making light of everything that has happened this past year. An appreciation of   surreal silliness.  On that we ended the night, with another toast to our good health.Our first party."},

Apply carefully measured amounts four times a day , evenly spaced, using a measuring card, do not get it near anything or you could kill it, go blind, die of  severe digestive issues...great. and no thank you. Dr. Google is so very helpful- I started to read the gnats again, just to confirm, and realized that yes indeed this is bad medicine.

We have not heard a peep out her this spring.It is a proper good deer fence, keeps the rabbits out as well. So I have hung out the welcome sign on our yard, I hate that their feelings might be hurt. Though, that in mind, I have made a shopping list of plants to buy that the deer do not like to eat.I will buy some probably not enough and plant them around our BLM sign in the front where it can be seen by the q-annoners down the road.Lavender does remarkably well - our neighbor across the street has her entire yard full- a bit overpowering when in flower but easy to care for and is sort of wild looking. This morning  this was sent to my phone from the lad down south, \"They found me\" , I had a \"Resist\" sticker on my wheel cover on the back and asked him before he left if he should cover it with something , it will not come off no matter how many car washes I have been through-  it has been well stuck on  for six years. He insisted that it was not profound or irritating  enough to warrant attention in Portland, as most car stickers do. Looks like mother was right.Plus they bent the hell out of the antenna. Better than bullet holes I said to myself.Portland is still a mess, a haven for nazi bullshit for some reason, Probably it's history of KKK enthusiasts It is a sad ,violent history, then all  of a sudden  these artist  showed up, all cool and liberal,  and ruined everything white supremacist.

Some give the impression they go on living only because it’s a habit they cannot shake.” Googled him, his wife and children- remarkable people. Small blurb from an interview, Alieda--I’m the eldest of Che’s four children with my mother. Papi was known around the world as the Argentine revolutionary, a guerrilla leader and major figure of the Cuban revolution, but we were just a normal family. I never felt special as his daughter. Where I did feel special was as the child of a couple who loved each other dearly.Mrs. Ernesto Rafael Guevara de la Serna, Four children in six years with Che. Made clothing for them all out of scraps found. A family that refused special treatment or privilege. \" I still live and work in Havana, as a paediatrician, and feel hopeful for the future of Cuba. Do I have hope for humanity? None of us has a crystal ball, but if we want a different world, we need to work to achieve it. We can’t wait for it to fall out of the sky. We have a duty to forge that future ourselves.. \", Alieda March, eldest child. Human struggle, what we  signed up for, I guess, as it never ceases. A habit we can not shake...But we have a duty. So it goes. This human condition.Here is one Miss who shook her habit,Sent through the post from  Fresca of the North, she arrived in good nick quite  anxious to begin a new life.Going fishing was second on her agenda, the first was to let her hair down and to settle into something comfy.And to bang on the drums all day."},

It still has a rattle  inside the dash which has always been there , sounds like a bolt rolling around, It is annoying but not damaging. Plus the inside of the car has always had a weird odor, like old man skin. Could never get rid of it no matter what, and  was unsuccessful at finding a body.While the new car owner was busy the orphans discovered  his room, and his bag. They are curious, went through the top half until they found  only a sock . it was a fine sock but  not terribly  intriguing. The dig was slowly becoming a lost cause. No treasure to be found .Until-They found the stick- it -in- thing that makes  motors go and decided that that might be well worth keeping,  hiding, that way, the lad would have to stay never leave forever be in this house, and wouldn't that be just fine?  That was such a good plan it wore the clever orphans completely  out - they napped in the lad's bed for seventeen winks,  seventeen because that is how many winks they could count and they did not want to be there when he came back. He has the authority to admit his mother to the asylum against her will if he deems it appropriate. Of course he would think that the mother put the orphans to bed not realizing that the orphans have a will of their own.  Anyway, no chances taken! No mothers taken to the asylum. Not today.                                                                   I made  eight Four pound burritos , we ate too much and I can tell you  from this experience that those eleven pounds which   may have  been lost  last week can indeed be gained back in one evening . Unless the scale is a liar , which has  been my suspicion for years. Gadgets are not entirely trust worthy. Tomorrow we will go to the storage unit where Erik may have something of value that he wants to sell. Fingers crossed it is what he thinks it is. I did take him around the living room today and pointed out that some of  the furniture is of value , who made it and when and how much it is worth in today's market. You know, in case we die in the next day or so , he must know that these furnitures would pay his rent for a very long time. Of course there is always the possibility that the tectonic plates will do their scoot, all will be under the sea and the value will  be a nickels worth .

It is very bossy, however, it is great for Dennis who tends to drive like he is on the speed way in second place   and much catch up-like there is a prize involved.  This car is going to keep him out of jail , we are assuming, and will remind him to take his purchases in to the house rather than leave them in the back seat.  This little car is like a  nagging parent."},

It is quite a gem actually. Handles well, is heavy enough to stay on the road. And he is feeling much better about not pumping carbon into our dying earth's atmosphere. Good on you, Dennis, well done! Claim is that it could make two round trip  journeys to Seattle on one charge. I will not be temping fate on that claim. This will take some getting used to.

After about ten years of Chinese culture I dropped it as though it was a high school   infatuation.  I tried Sumi-e , ground the ink, made one floor a place to spread out and practice bamboo leaves, Sumi-e requires space- I learned something, number one-  I am abysmal at Sumi-e, I have too many ingrained patterns to be effective in the art of brush/ink and number two, I have no discipline. I worked in the  shop, Chinese imports from before China became favored nation, Rare, ancient  and cool treasure  from mainland China brought back by \"my  Chinese family\".  I worked for $2.00 an hour   a few objects thrown in to compensate .

Little did I know how much I would love it!  I just took it for \"filler\". It mostly focused on Caldecott winners for  art and imagination of  books.  During the Quarter we also made our  books, illustrated with our own work, mine was a bit too dark for a children's book, the story line was a surreal nightmare- not something anyone would want to read before bed, or  anytime, for that matter. One of my favorite books from 1940 , Aprils Kittens, appeared in my stash of the past- I bought a first edition in compromised condition, from the annual  library book sale for a quarter - for the class.  The author and illustrator, Clare Turlay Newberry, used ink, watercolor and charcoal, drawing from life - even bought an ocelot to have around her house to draw from -  I appreciate her art. She could likely  do one swoop of her brush and you would know immediately that it was a cat. Subtle use of color, brevity of line,  like sumi -e  conveying spirit of the subject- fascinating!  Yesterday I had an eye exam. I bought new glasses and ordered new lenses for  computer glasses, All is right with the world. I will get my new glasses in about two weeks or so...The frames are purple.

The day so beautiful - like walking into a dream!Stella bought some fish for the deck. a covid purchase. She adopted a Polish girl, Leena. with amazing long braids, from the EBAY orphanage.  Leena was made to feel like one of the girls , she  is not able to stand . Legs all wobbly, I get that! Climbing the stairs this morning was like climbing Everest! So Leena sits and looks pretty, one must do what one is good at. Her sitting skills are superb. Stella is a great little shopper I must say! She got this wonderful print ,  broadcloth  canvassy material, for two bucks at the human society shop. She made a lemon cake with strawberries and cream, I had tea she had a Long Drink , the drink of Finland, with a drop of gin. Stella, yearning for her mother land but knowing  the long cold dark winters there would be her undoing. Plus , during the two months of great summer weather , the mosquitos devour humans.  Blood sucking insects are rarely pictured or mentioned in travel  pamphlets. So good to spend some time with our Stella, most excellent of humans. We did not speak of our nation's horror- we did talk about the effed up health system ( as if there is a \"system\" ) .  We made a possible tenuous plan to go somewhere maybe sometime...vague you say? Well, prices have sky rocketed,  And covid  is making her forth attempt at leveling the population , now that we have let our guard down. I am breaking my promise  to not post yet another cherry tree photo but this morning as the sun was coming up , she did this!  I wish you could sit beside her in person! Green leaves appearing rapidly,  gentle graceful tree.  Erik's  Birthday climbing tree. I invited the little neighbor girls to climb it anytime they want. If they fell it would be a soft landing, besides , children are rubber and I am right here with compresses , bandaids. and a spoon full of sugar. Which actually helps. My brother was kicked by a horse, my aunt gave him a spoonful of sugar . The next day there was no amount of sugar that could have helped, but temporarily it seemed to take the edge off."},

Of course I did!  Cotton from India , not altogether silly- a  useful , happy, love you from my  head tom-ah-toe.  Twenty years ago a friend returned with objects from Japan, all with the most ridiculous  Engrish. Erik had a book bag that said something like \"Happy criminals\" with   kids eating peanut butter  from a gun (?) Another sandwich bag that said \"  pretty potato\" and a box of tissue paper saying it was \" tender devil.\"   and to beware!-0-Here is Peg , looking lovely in the sunshine. Menu today - string cheese and chicken, a favorite. It must have been due to the amount of rain we had this past year- the trees are the happiest I have ever seen them. I mean REALLY, just look at the branches crowded with blossoms- like chubby legs! When a bright blue jay sits on one of those plump pink  branches  my eyes nearly  break!  A good tree for climbing.It will be  green soon enough  with long slender leaves and a hand full of bright vermillion cherries the size of your thumb nail.  I will not post another photo of her being so flamboyant!  Standing under her is to enter a different world (  pretty much needed right now) , enveloped in blossoms  all around & nearly to the ground. Energizing  reassuring Mama nature hug. Here are a couple of wild beauties, one you have met before, She has an old new boyfriend!Sock monkeys have  such individual charm, depending on the person who stitched them.The  commercial wanna be's are cute enough,  but are not legit . This truly legit one  came to the house yesterday.  He is very old as you can see by the socks used.  It's a romance!  I gave one away, he wore a red fez and red corduroy overalls- sort of wish He still lived here but , you know - three's a crowd when it comes to romance- or is that just a human construct?They never went to your school, they sleep in a monkey tree...\"Mother Mother\" Where everything is free. AND I just read that they have been so successful with Chimera pig /human- Monkey/ human is next. They have been messing around with recipes in a dish and are confident that monkey/humans will make  great organ harvests.  Erm...-0-Bob Ragland died.  I reckon creative persons  who are not  hoarding are  crippled in their pursuits.  The sky is  empty space to refresh  if one needs .   It all works out ,  balance,   the artist dies  leaving all of that stuff for the living to deal with.  I suppose, for the conscientious., that presents a dilemma.   Bob's hoard is inspiration I am  sure, wouldn't you love to be left with it to sort?   Maybe being conscientious isn't all thatAND THIS. back it up to the beginning, It seems to be stuck a few minutes in. When you have more time and you want to hear some lovely words, this is a worthy watch/listen.

{"title": "shoot from the deck, blossoms, cranky crow, gremlins", "date": "Thursday, April 15, 2021", "text": "Shooting rabbits from the deck. You can not see them because they ran away. What you do see is SHADOW! The sun has returned and the day is lyrical!I shot the crow being sassy on the gravestone where Timmy was buried, general  area sort of pretty much, Timmy was our turtle and I am not entirely sure where his little shell rests., but the stone is perfect for him so that is where I pray to the turtle gods for Timmy's soul.  All of those pretty little weeds must be removed before they take over. I like them- I like weeds probably too much to ever become a master gardener, or even a half assed gardener. Leaves bursting out of the cherry blossom dresses. This tree is so magnificent I stare at it all the time, like it is going to do something even more magical. Last night I watched it bend and move and jitter. The jitters were large black bumble bees that are so large they bend branches, but I was not sure. Eye floaters  trick me, this time  the bouncing black blobs were indeed bumble bees. They scatter a storm of  petal confetti , the deck and yard look like the aftermath of a  wild wedding. I gathered some tulips yesterday after having gone to the dentist for a mouth stone scrub. The  Hygienist exclaimed \"I have not seen you for over a year\" . What a year!! We agreed that we do not know where the time went or what we did during that time. Covid paralysis-  She said that she painted a few rocks, other than that ,it is  a blur. I related that on the way in I listened to radio where Mick jagger was being interviewed briefly, saying that he only managed to learn three languages, do the dishes and write a song. ONLY? At the moment, My favorite shape- fuchsia not yet offering themselves to the humming birds.  I would stay this way if it were up to me and I was a fuchsia. This morning before sunrise, I barefooted up the stairs in the dark. My leg forcing me to wake up  and walk it off. Googled what could be this annoyance -turns out it is sciatica which is doable.  Of course my tiny  worrying mind goes right into the worst case- and before you know it I am lying in bed with visions of me minus one leg all the way up to my neck,  being fitted for a prosthesis, a ramp, a wheel chair and possibly  having a combo of MS and cancer.Sciatica is  a nerve thing, painful -not deadly. Annoying and wobbly in a Walter Brennan way. . Anyway, , Got up , made coffee, slipped into my clogs, and thought , Oh Fuck no- what  now!! I am going to have to have my foot amputated for sure. My foot would not even slide half way into my clog and when it did it was painful,  Kicked off my shoe and this is what was inside- Scissors, keys, a scrunchy ( which would have gone unnoticed probably )  a stick of gum and my new tooth brush.  Hmmmm- gremlins? The same ones that come in when we are not looking and shift things to other spots, the ones who take the pliers  out of the drawer and put them in the refrigerator? Why do they only  pick on the elderly? Assholes! I might need a bunch of these to do a birds film with the orphans."},

Believe it or not I have washed the glass a few times. These are such well done finger paintings that I may have to keep them for a while.  One rolly-polly girl rolled all over the deck so pleased with herself- she found the  kibble stash - her sisters were already back in the woods being wild things, so, yes she did manage to eat MUCH!Then the postal service delivered the Princess worms. Finally! There were many that thought they might make a get away during transport, they got away  all right, to worm heaven , the ones that were patient and not freaked out will have a good paying  job in the worm bin and a lovely little worm life.  Cutting up the avocado and banana just right because you know...princesses.Doll sanctuary received help too, a nurse to carry out all of the medical needs in the dolly den. Then this fell out of my tablet , painted one dark rainy night in the winter when my studio was in working order and I was feeling like we lived under a bog. The Bog King introducing his bride to his kingdom. It has been said that bog folks can live without vitamin D or a clothes line. This couple  have the creepiness factor that is admired among their kind.  Speaking of \"their kind\", Dennis upgraded his genome -23 and me -thing, gave them some cash for more info. Found out that he is a carrier for a rare genetic disease that , had he fathered a child with another carrier  it would have been a disastrous situation and the child would not have lived  very long.  He also got the % of Neanderthal in us and the three boys, which sent me into the google world of research into our ancestors. Neanderthals , as the scientists continue to find, were very clever, vocal,  made and wore jewelry, red haired, green eyed, not half bad looking. No wonder homo sapiens wooed them and made babies. The image that we have been stuck with all these years was a mistake-  the remains of an elderly man deformed from arthritis, hunched over, short necked, legs bowed,  and well, cave man looking... found and presented  as \"Neanderthal. \"  One guy representing all.   (I do like the Bog Kings dress) I said \"YES\" to the pug puppy, then said \"NO\" .  I got word from DOG himself- came right up to the deck door , ate some kibble  and left- not without imparting some advice , mind you, GOOGLE the care and feeding of PUG. I did. Thank you DOG, I don't know where he came from , he had a blue collar and I have never seen him before, but in the nick of time- I was saved from a life of Pug. ( one of the most demanding breeds) Bog King and Queen  may hang in the worm's house, all moist and dark and bog-ish. They would feel at home there and the Princesses are sure to insist on a gallery- so...perfect timing.  Leaving you with a much better sunnier photo of the cherry this morning, the wind did not manage to take all of the blossoms. https://abbyabbydoo.blogspot.com/ trip on over to Abby's worn story!  GOOD ONE!!"},

The short white building sending steam to feed the clouds.  Well done, little white building.Across the way is the neighbors magnolia tree, I took this from the deck in between roof tops. Magnificent magnolia! The wind has just kicked up - in twenty minutes  the tree blossoms will  all be on the floor. Messing around  listing stuff on Etsy today, it is fun when stuff sells and the reviews come back all shiny and fabulous...anyway, I noticed the doll looking around the corner, eyeing something that intrigued her...You say tom -ay-toe and I say to-mah-toe. Dennis gets boxes of them at a time and they are soon consumed  like candy, they are so delish! To-mah-toe on everything except peanut butter. Not a great combo, I mean, in a pinch its OK - no jam in the house...Lazy day and the weather is misbehaving. bloody cold, windy dark- time to go to bed, it is afternoon. Prince Philip is dead. He certainly did live  a life,  completely wore him out, took a while but there you go, dead.  I feel so lucky to have been born in this era- it has been pretty damned interesting, wouldn't you say?  AND the trial for the murder of Mr. Floyd, curious how the defense is not getting away with any of the usual court room shenanigans. The prosecutors are doing a fine job- no bullshit, sir. toss that honkey slime ball in the pokey forevermore, please. My god the trial is so difficult to watch . Heart breaks every three minutes."},
{"title": "Goblins had a baby, princess worms, springtime in the yard", "date": "Thursday, April 8, 2021", "text": "The goblins had a baby,  felted these out of alpaca and silk which broke at least seven  needles. Silk is tough stuff.  I used alpaca and silk because it is strong , floppy and narrow unlike corriedale, which is easier and quicker to needle felt but is fuzzy, firm and fat.  Detail like long fingers and ability to be limber is an advantage of alpaca and silk . I would not advise anyone to use it unless you have loads of needles to burn. Just waiting for their arrival, Dennis adopted a pound of red worms- their diet is more fussy than we anticipated , we were thinking that they could consume all sorts of our rubbish but they are princess worms, recommended that their food be tossed in a blender and made into mash,  moist, not wet -also that the egg shells be washed, and baked and crunched up. They are tender little princesses and will not eat onion, garlic, spicy stuff,  oranges, lemons, grapefruit, meat or dairy or processed food. The worm people are waiting for just the right weather to send them, who knew they would be so demanding.The next wind will take all of the cherry petals so ...here they are again, being the word of the day \"hyperbolical\".  What else is going on in the yard today, Things that came up in spite of being deer nibbled.And the volunteers are still managing to pop up -"},
{"title": "hey kids- What time is it??", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2021", "text": "smash on!-0- Look at how well she has healed! She looks a bit scruffy and scarred but oh so much better, Thank you mother Nature for letting her live and be cute !Winter came back today, Cold, thick, dark.The tree photo  ( above) was taken yesterday , It is at the top of our street. More tame than our cherry tree. Ours is a wild thing, nearly up in the clouds- which is , I suppose , not such a challenge on a day like today. The clouds are weighted , sitting heavy , low.  Rain, oozing ground.  i feel like a sandwich, I am fatback in between slices of water soaked bread. I bought two presents for Dennis , which both came quickly- Presents for no particular event or reason. One is a garden chair/knee/  stool + tool bag thing, and the other - nine packets of moss rose for his light and grow. The veg that grew during winter are pretty much over. The tomatoes grew to be marble size, The basil , most successful, the lettuce - meh. I think the \"Click and Grow\"  may do well with moss rose, little bright spots!  They do not take themselves  too  seriously , as do vegetables.  Poor vegetables, they did disappoint. I think that this little grow light contraption would be great for starting seeds to plant in our non-existing garden.This is Wednesday- hump day.  (Hump day is an idiom that means Wednesday, a day of the week. The term hump day first appeared in the 1960s in North America, most probably in business offices. Hump day is based on the idea that the work week is a mountain one must climb. The general office work week is Monday through Friday, consisting of five days.) Everyone knows that- but just in case you thought it was something sexy- it's not. Since everyday is just like every other day it is meaningless to consider Wednesday as the middle of the week.  What is a week? Anyway, have a smashing day! I think we are going to be just fine! Xx"},
{"title": "Watching something good!", "date": "Tuesday, April 6, 2021", "text": "I have been watching \"Worn Stories\" on Netflix . I highly recommend!! Delicious stories woven into the fabric of one important garment in one's life. Episode One begins with those who do not wear clothing and how it simplifies , as you might expect,  economical. not to mention eco friendly...the lifestyle requires warmth and sunshine, and a heaping spoonful of confidence. Above is my Dad's Work bandana from the Union Pacific, A Union man from the thirties. There are way too many stories about my Dad's bandana and why I have kept it for all my life- so I will move on to a more simple one-This is the housedress I found in one of the back sheds where I lived in Melbourne with my boyfriend. We traveled together , lived van life together, lived in London,   and decided , spur of the moment to go to Australia to see his mother and brothers and big elderly black dog named \"Ferocious\" ( he was not what his name claims, he was as docile as a potato)  My boyfriend's  mother's family had always  lived on  this one street in Elsternwick, I think, I can not remember exactly where the hell I was. Anyway, they were a family of keepers of things (hoarders). All  back sheds were full  , cool stuff, grand stuff, from 1800's and on through the decades and from about every country in the universe.  Stuff buried, stuff in attics , stuff everywhere,  three houses full . A pickers delight. I loved going through history there. It was like one long acid trip in a museum  for over the three month period, until I had to leave the country due to visa and lack of funds. His Grand mother made her own house dresses and this was one of them. I wore it everyday, having lost  most of my clothing in Singapore , not having enough money to buy more. I traveled in this dress,  babysat,  cleaned,  foraged, cooked, gardened,  watched crazy Australian soaps, hiked in the fern woods, walked the beaches, carried a puppy in the pocket,  played in the snow at Mt. Buller, finally , when my three months was up,  I came home with it in my back pack, wore it for a few more years until it became fragile and thread bare.  If the house burns  and this dress goes up in flames , that will be the only way  it could be released. and i am sure, my skin would feel that burn, blister and peel. It has been that much a part of my being.   I wore it barefoot and booted, as a frock over 501's- an apron -gatherer of  apples and beach wood,  became pregnant  in and then  sadly not pregnant in ,  worn to farm blueberries, live off grid,  worn to study in -  to classes- finish U.  degree , rehearse in, and sometimes break the law in. (weed, not murder...)  First the arm blew, then  holes began appearing  like I had been shot Bonnie and Clyde style, the fabric too thin to mend. A worn story- not  remotely  as compelling as the one's  told  in the documentary - oh man, they are great...I am pretty sure that everyone has a worn story of some sort-  look in your bottom drawer,  bet you will find something there that you have had for more than half of your life, maybe all of your life, woven with   story that I, for one,  am dying to hear.  The series is wonderful and continues to get better and better, I will be sad when I watch the final episode.  Looking forward to hearing your worthy worn story.  Keeping this dress is like keeping my soul grounded. Know what I mean?"},

Looks like I could just leap right off into that bouncy sky!Our springtime baby! I made this rabbit suit for him when he was two years old , he loved it so much he wore it until he was five.  Though this photo does not look much like \"love\".It was the softest vintage flannel , thick and luxurious. His birthday is in a couple of days so Easter and birthday were sort of a long egg filled celebration. One year I made a piñata for his birthday. He wore his birthday suit.  He is now 34, still has his birthday suit -covers it appropriately now.  Happy Birthday!Easter was rather grand when we were growing up. We got new clothes and I always got a hat from upstairs  Woolworth's, we went to church,   and ate ham. My Dad NEVER went to church and Mom sent us on our own , she was Christian but kept it to herself. I liked church and so did my brother. Not for the crazy stories and contrivances  but for the fresh flowers , visual splendor,  neighbors dressed to the nines, the music and the  pink velvet cushions on the  sage green pews. It was joyful. I carried a dime in my glove for the collection plate - which rarely made it to its destined purpose, as there was a drug store next to the church - a bin full of candy. I determined that baby Jesus would approve, he could not claim to be  a  special holy baby  if he did not prefer tootsie pops to a collection plate.  I mean, really. For  Our Ms. Mary Moon  and her  chickens- a screen image floated by the other night of Dexter with his Easter lamb. Awwww.Happy spring y'all, we made it through the weirdest! The fruit trees are in full bloom, There is a patch of blue sky, A raccoon , plump with babies, on the deck having a snack, and our lad, bearing way too many scars of life for his young age,  has called to say \"thank you\" for the gift of cheesecake.

{"title": "A trip down the road, a shiny thing and jars.", "date": "Friday, April 2, 2021", "text": "Driving home from donating a car load of stuff to the charity shop, I took photos of some of the faves along the way. The barn red building used to be the taxidermy where I took Erik when he was little. It was one of our favorite places to go. They were most accommodating to Erik and showed him how to put a bears face onto the fiberglass form.  He called it the \"skin store\" and wanted to go there sometime to  make a friend for himself.  I have said that memory before, I am running out of memories...Sad to see the building  become  an \" art and craft classes offered\" place. Glue guns and glitter can not hold a candle to a bears face( strange figure of speech)The very quiet theater guild, where the stage is small , the audience small, and the acting big. Someday we may go back there to see something fabulous and gay. Someday...Just a blue house on the corner . Fond. There are many houses on this stretch of road that are well kept and lovely.  They used to be hang outs in the hippie days, communes and pot luck dinners, home made everything including music. Dennis's office is  an old house from the 1800's . The jars , nine of them, were in the basement collecting dust and bugs. Dennis used the blue Ball jar for motor oil.  EW! But it cleaned up nicely.  The Kerr family has an interesting history, The last \"man\" standing  took it on when Mr. Kerr died as well as three of the \"bosses\" dead in a matter of months. Mrs. Kerr, third wife, not only raised all of the children from her husbands previous marriages but had five of her own. She took on the company  (out of no choice  because dead people are not much help) and it succeeded beyond dreams, as well as building a couple of  orphanages and a Christian university in Santa Barbara, she died in 1961 of utter exhaustion no doubt. I came home, looked at the mess of a house, which one day may move me to clean- the sun comes out and everything is way too visible.I have to gear up for it as everything wants attention and gallons of soapy water. Instead I  played with gold leaf and copper paint . So shiny - it does not photograph well. She is the queen of corona, then became the puppet queen  of corona.  Today is bad Friday, not a good day for Jesus, they say, & some idiot just rammed his car through the Capital barrier. Death wish, we reckon.  AND The murderer's trial is so damned sad we can not watch or hear the witnesses without experiencing  deeper heartbreaking  trauma. Knowing more about Mr. Floyd, a sweet man, a beloved man. What a damned year this has been. No Justice No Peace and if that POS cop does not end up in the gallows you can be sure that this country will erupt more forcefully than what this past summer ' \"unrest\" brought. My hope of course is that police reform may be a result and that BLM will continue to garner our attention.  Might be nice if the human species got its shit together before the earth burns up, which, by the way , it is doing. 2050. all done."},

Or is it?(volunteer grape hyacinth in a pot of the deck, just popped up!)(Cherry buds below)What about the stuff we collect?  What about the unearthed treasure of past civilizations giving us a wealth of  perspective , history,  a buzz of wonder- lives lived in extraordinary times, bones, isn't there \"soul\" in  \"stuff\" ?  Dennis's request is to have  his body donated to the university  med dept.  - not before he is well and truly dead, mind you. I understand but (ew)...My parents , my brother, my friends requested cremation. I find no peace in that either. A jar in the china hutch full of ashes carries  no sense of soul, just a feeling of obligation and loss.    Here is an option-A  tiny garden , a place for  folks to sit , eat a sandwich,  feel and think, a modest tomb  in which things of that life lived beside a shriveled corpse , good teeth , until, in a thousand  years or so , it would all   be unearthed  by enthusiastic  students  of anthropology  perplexed, astounded and delighted,  with objects of these times, important historical items , like plastic orphans a perfectly dried loaf of sourdough, perhaps a bog roll.  Taking up valuable land space in this overly crowded world might be unwise. If the spot of land , however,  is a time capsule for future anthropologists- and a \"meanwhile\" place for folks to gather wits and maybe a  \"lay thy burdens down\" reprieve,  why not?  A place for dogs to romp and pee and for children  to gather  for ghost stories at dusk,  I am opting for that. Dennis is opting for medical science. Both are pretty good choices,  just that one is free  of expense and one is most certainly not!  Buying a small park  with  tomb might be prohibitive.In one thousand years or so who would not be delighted to find an African carved  wooden classroom, or a toy piano played by  Plastic orphans? Objects indicative of these times of the plague.By the way, another orphan arrived!  As Fresca pointed out, our house may have been marked like in the old hobo days.Name is Tula , goes by Toot.  It has been  such an existential crisis year has it NOT? Question everything, judge not, with the exception of orange shenanigans and the fallout, which continues and will for some time. Wear a mask for the rest of your life, stay well , do how you do, go a little bit mad.  Some happenings during this  past year  have shaken  priorities and perspective  in a no nonsense way, limiting choices has actually given us the opportunity and space to be  more thoughtful about the ones we  do make.  Life - a blip, as  quick and as  temporary as  that minute that just went by.  Swallow blue pill, shop at the  midnight internet store, buy a dolly army,  make bread,  obsess over raccoon life, walk empty street to nowhere, paint tiny things in a gorgeous hand made booklet, love and admire blog world folks, who have all done so remarkable well during this keeping boat afloat year. I thank you all! You are brilliant.Becoming allies  for  our POC sisters and brothers- the big take away from this  pivotal year. Carry on.   License ,  undeniably important and useful?  Stay well, wear masks, they say, forevermore. Another virus pandemic on the  way, they say. We are well practiced and possibly the jab will somewhat protect from the next big one, inevitable, they say..."},

He is from 1920-30 , a time traveler, and quite like Kathe Kruse , maybe a few giant steps down, but totally affordable. His head is celluloid , which was outlawed  because dollys heads caught on fire,  and that was just too much trauma. Anyway, this one, made in Germany was an orphan , lingering on the internet ,out there cold and lonely.  Midnight purchase, I can not be stopped!  (stop me, please! remove my fingers) I like him better naked, seeing the stitches .  He came packed in newborn disposable diapers as packing  material. Two diapers wrapped around his fragile flammable head. If he had a thought it might be that he is glad his journey is over and he is sitting by a blooming shamrock. Our  Neighbor decided that going down to the mail boxes was not the best situation, especially for his little girls crossing the street,  nor is it great for Peder who is in his mid nineties ,plus all of our boxes are falling down,  having been there since the seventies. so he put together a presentation for the post office to consider. Moving our five boxes under our street light at the end of our driveway. Brilliant!  He would do the work and the ordering of  the right stuff. The post office grumpy man said\"Maybe\", \" We will see...\" not sounding very positive.   Really? I mean look at this! It is so much better! But then, grumpy man works for the post office so his life can not be fabulous. He works in a dungeon. Anyway, fingers crossed. Even if we can not move the boxes, they will need replacing in their present location. They are held up with fisherman's rope at the moment , leaning closer to the ground every day.  Ok, then...I am off to NOT shop on the internet. Enough!!"},

He just felt like he had always been nestled there. . When I got home I looked him up , the artist had signed it in a secret place . His tail lifts up and inside his back  is a little box. \" Cedar Raven is the keeper of secrets , a magical shifter. He represents Change, rebirth, Wisdom and healing\". There were a few things in the shop that I held for about a minute , thought about parting with a dollar - put them all back- catch and release method- except for Raven.  Perfect timing, as change, rebirth, wisdom and healing are sorely needed about now., and Raven is just the guy for the job!The rain came back and brought a small wind. Some enjoy it, like ferns and hefty moss on roof tops. LOVE the rain.Remember my favorite little shed with the fabulous screen door and the mouse and bug  families that lived there? This is all that is left of it. I will not be surprised if some one builds a tall condo building there, removing what is left of the little orchard. \"Change, rebirth...\"blah blah... Farther on is the blue shed. I love the color! When  the exterior of the office  wanted paint ,I did a bit of research on outdoor paint. I was told that any paint of a blue hue will not last long and must be painted again after a couple of years.  Exhibit #1. Paint that has a  gold or ochre hue will last for years,  we went with that because who wants to paint the entire building again after only a couple of years? It would be like the golden gate bridge, once the end is reached it is back to the beginning and round and round the painter goes. Who  has that sort of ambition, or ability to go up and down tall ladders with a can of paint?  That is something I likely will not be doing ever again in this life. Brought home fried chicken,   frozen cookie dough, the Raven and a yearning to be a magical shifter.  It has been a good day, Oh, but the damned rain/cold...I would magically shift , if I were a magical shifter, to the surface of the sun!"},

Great location, by trails and parks and the water. Grocery store just a quick walk away. Bus stop close by. This.. because I just liked the shadow of the fishing net and sticks. Sunshine makes wonderful shadows.Sunlight and shadows are such a novelty! It has been so dark, and cold , steady rain, ...bleah. Gloom. Do you understand why I have gone orphan crazy? Today is like Disneyland and cotton candy!Wavy fence waving at you. Some one does not like straight lines, I agree. or maybe they just did not have a Level at the time of building - \"fug it, let's just not even try...we will call it art\".This little house was built specifically for the woman's cats. Their one bedroom house was too small for the number of cats that she collected -so the good man built this for her.  I went inside once...Most certainly built for  cats  only ,  and their pleasure. Layers and shelves , a branch for climbing, play things, ropes and swings, and cosy spots. A window for watching the birds in the little tree. They never went outside. Curious life.  Covid life. Nice little walk around, I am so rusty!  The sun makes me drunk!! Drunk and rusty, wobbling down the road.  It has been a great day."},

They had been notified via   Duck  flying overhead that Beth Anna would bring lunch and a surprise. Their names are Matilda. To tell them apart one is called Tilly and one is called Milly. Sometimes Tilly is called Tilda. That is her being cross name. Or MATILDA for getting her attention. Milly is always just Milly.  OH!!! There you are!! Ohhh! HUG!! Squish , hug!Beth Anna excitedly told stories of where she lives and her new friends and Duck, chicken, Spotty dog, and the twins.  The Matildas thought it sounded  fine and grand!Too good to even be a real true  thing. Well,  guess what....SURPRISE!  Matlildas are invited to go live where Beth Anna lives and leave the orphanage, forever!  \"YAY, Will we get to eat a EGG?\"The answer was \"of course, a egg and maybe two a egg!\", \"Walk this way\". and Beth did her silly walk, as she does when she is the leader...They arrived at the station with their IDs pinned to them, and waited.Nat was sent to collect them in her fire truck, apologized for being late but had to give the twins some  Elmer's  glue in their special  sippy cups or they would not travel well. Anyway, she was there in good  enough time and told them that there was a plan to go to the Babpka's for  a snack before supper , \" Supper at Babpkas ,too?\" they asked, \"Natch\", said Nat ( \"natch\" being one of her favorites replies. ) The Babpkas made delicious plastic, and they also had another surprise!A special photo was their surprise!  It is a photo of their  grand child in the far away place from where they came. She may visit one day!  The orphans are excited! \"Does she have red hair\", they asked. The wall changes a little bit, some of my favorites have been covered.The hungry greedy mouth eating up the waterfront is a new one and most appropriate. Ironically the Irish company building the condos on the the specious property have paid the artist to paint and repaint the surrounding fence until the buildings magically appear for over one mill a unit. For the most part the paintings , at the moment , are not political, mundane but colorful. Covered are \"Black lives matter\", \"pink pussies' , 'Dump trump\" and anything with any shout out.That bugs me!The acid ball is right around the corner, it is magnificent. Acid ball, not ball of acid, which would be an entirely different story!There was a contest for artists to enter ideas for the acid ball- I think the winner was going to cover it with mirrors- NOOOOO!So far that has not happened , if and when it does, I am thinking a few rocks could remedy that bad decision. It is wonderful as it is. Honored for all of its hard work at the mill doing its acid thing for so many years. It had a sister but I don't know where she went, landfill? The corpse aroma of the studios is a seasonal thing , usually during warm days, It has NOT been warm so ....who knows. Maybe it has something to do with the lack of traffic around the building  (covid19) so the sea gulls moved their entire armies in to the air vents with their massive poos . Today is Sunday. Dark rainy and cold, Quiet, and worthy of baking bread ...or something. Problem is that I would  wolf  all of the bread, ballooning to a wobble- scratch that idea.

Duck became  bored of it and snoozy, climbed  onto Nat's warm lap with the spotty dog.Everyone soon felt  snoozy,  cosy , rain pattering outside,  clouds covering the land with  heavy heavy  heavy  dark dampness. ZZZzzzz-zzzzzzTrees by the bay- I went to the studio , but high tailed it out of there licketty split- Horrid stench permeating the building, not sure what it is -it comes and goes, maybe it is seasonal, maybe the damned building  is haunted by a foul nasty  rotting death ghoul . The land lord said it is just sea gull poop on the roof. Unless that sea gull weighs four thousand pounds and eats dead rotting animals, guts and all...I am not buying it. As I stated before,  I am on the fence about staying in the building, This could be the decider!  Through my two masks the terribleness  smacked me hard on the nose. Ew. Change of space, digging around in  past travels , when Sarah and I went up north, Northumberland on a little holiday road trip. Sarah knows the best places and is the best driver in all the land. I have posted about this castle before I am pretty sure, as it has been most memorable! Chillingham Castle.A most intriguing place, made spookier by the current owner who has a flair for eccentric collections of things and  odd decor. The inside of the castle is a wonder to behold but so claustrophobic I will not take you there today....we are already feeling a bit cabin feverish are we not?The grounds and garden are closed in enough. Notice the bat as a closure lock for the gate.This is the lake below the gardens, where we did not venture. It is an unsettling place all of it, but the \"Edward Room\" and the lake are truly creepy.  The lake is where the bodies that were not burned were dumped, It is not a happy lake and there was no bird life there....dead  foreboding lake. We did not feel compelled to go down there.          Nope.If we ever travel again in this lifetime, I would heartily suggest a trip up to Chillingham, unless , of course, it has become too much of a proppy kitchy  - tourist attraction with exaggerated  contrived spookiness- which is so not needed, The place does very well on its own. Quite a history, which is palpable even before you reach the stairs.Free to roam through the rooms without being policed or roped off. The living room where the harp is by the window has a very large carved , painted wooden bathtub in front of it. It belonged to Marie Antonette, we were told, and much later purchased by Mick Jagger . It did not go with the decor of  his new digs so was  sold it to the Castle.  The dungeon and the Edward room were the creepiest places I have ever been .  Even tops the frontier prison in Rawlins Wyo. the gas chamber the sad dark freezing metal stone cells of the  unfortunates  imprisoned there.  No, this castle tops them all. It holds  dark happenings...although during reconstruction  one of the hauntings moved out, so the story goes. The haunting blue boy- whose bones were uncovered during restoration under the ancient stone floor, was finally set free. There are many such stories about this castle, none of them pleasant. Except for the bath tub...and Sarah's company, which is always pleasant!"},

The legend died?Jordan, the nurse came today, Maple , Marden and Nat decide it might be a good idea for Beth Anna to get a check up.Nat gave her a coat , her scarf and slippers but the chill went deep into her  orphan plastic.Beth Anna thought it a good idea to take the twins in as well, They did not eat their plastic oatmeal, surely something must be terribly wrong!Good report, the twins had consumed  elastic band spaghetti  that morning and  were satiated, that's all. Beth Anna ate their oatmeal,  as not to waste a good thing, plus she is still hungry  all of the time from being  orphany, you understand. So, good news, everyone had full middles, no problem there. Jordan checked Beth Anna and knew right away - the perfect prescription. From her medical case she removed just the thing for Beth Anna's \"shivers.\" (  medical term) The slippers would not do ,though , generous of Nat to give them to the care and well being of the new  plastic sister in the house, they simply were not made for the great  cold wet outdoors. Warm sox and  new shoes- and a pat on the head. Jordan is a medical professional, a genius! Glad to have her  in the neighborhood. Maple asked if she might have the poke thing, Jordan said YES. Maple will use it as a  hot day summertime squirt gun  . Jordan made Maple pinky swear that Maple will not poke anyone ever.  Maple pinky sweared . And then the sun went down with a thud.

Ain't you got no candy?\"She was well received. Given the best chair, a foot massage, a shoulder rub- the usual greeting. She was offered a soft boiled blue egg and a cup of milk but she was wobbly from travel .Before she fell right over -She was put to bed and watched very closelyWhile she slept the others unpacked the important things she brought from the orphanage.The light bulb - for bright ideas, she would  have many. Pet turtle, slow and steady,  a vertebrae, she must always have backbone, a guard, she would always be guarded, an action figure, for obvious reasons, a wooden dolly, a die, for luck, and a bowl in case some one might offer  plastic oatmeal, Beth Anna's favorite. All is well, EBAY rarely has such a legit orphan, Lucky  she landed here. ( Sorry Auntie Fresca). Springtime, a good time for orphans , along with  primroses , plum blossoms,  a glimpse of sunshine.  Not adulting today, obviously.   Probably not tomorrow either.  Maybe never again! In the morning, I do well with silence,  space and a cup of joe sipped slowly. Not a morning person.I have read that no matter what, either you are  bouncy in the morning or you are not, it is like being seven feet tall, some people just are , some are not.  Not that getting up early is difficult, I prefer early mornings,  as long as no body else is awake, the quiet, stillness , dim light,   snapping out of  dreamland  ( dormir petite mort) takes some adjustment, silence .  My mug could be more polite I suppose, \"Please do not talk to me until I have sipped this quiet cup of warming French roast caffeine  and my thoughts have gathered, as I reenter this  particular  space time continuum to carry on another day in this bag of meat.

Weather was not in our favor, the plane stalled on the runway being de-iced several times , Little kid, no toilet, no water, no snacks , no leaving your seat for 5.5 hours. Finally we took off through  iffy skies. Not a pleasant flight , finally fell asleep and landed in Waikiki, which was not at all what we were expecting, big city, dirty and loud with rude taxi drivers and pissed off  people in charge. Due to weather and delay we missed our flight - had to find a place to stay overnight to go back to airport in the morning .  Hailed a taxi with the rudest of drivers in the universe, Erik trying to make him happy but he just gave everyone the NY salute , honked his horn, yelled \"mother fucker\" all the way to the airport.  Waited  for a flight to Maui all day with an anxious bored seven year old.  Finally arrived on Maui where Dennis could not find the car rental people . Chatted with people on the phone in his chatty way for hours. We did island stuff, played with parrots, went to an art gallery, ( Rembrandt, Erik - \"He is  the guy that makes toothpaste\".)  ate fab food, swam in the pool in the pouring  rain and in  the  big ocean. Then it was new year's eve, One of Dennis;'s staff got really drunk , nibbled on his shoulder, Erik intrigued. !  I went out in the ocean  alone ,to welcome the new year.  It was holy. Went to planet Hollywood, and an adult store where there was an enormous blow up penis wobbling around the shop.  Memorable  for a seven year old. Erik and I trespassed into a fancy hotel swimming pool with water falls and streams, We had a great time but we got busted and given the boot. I have no shame. Went to the beach where one of the staff and her husband were too far out- caught in a tide rip, at first we thought they were waving \"hello\".This \"comic book\" that I hastily drew for Erik  while we were on our Maui holiday, surfaced  from the bottom of a drawer,  worth keeping, I suppose, though  badly drawn.  We have taken trips to Hawaii since and have had much better holidays there.  Avoiding Waikiki  every time.  Maui is such a beautiful island, as is Kawaii,  each with its own individual character and beauty, as you probably know. We did go to the big island once for about two weeks, my least favorite of the lot, but said to be the most  Hawaiian. I don't know, I am not that fond of black lava  and crazy ocean waves that show no mercy.  It is not a soft island. Still there was magic there- a very large sea turtle joined me one day for a swim. I saw god.Sorry this is impossible to read, just thought I would save it to my blog in case  it gets tossed."},

Missing a few teeth from her gorgeous smile. -0-Harry and Meghan in the news though it is no news.-0-One day ,when Meghan and Harry were about  to get married, they were to go to  the radio station in Brixton just down the street from where I was, so , why not, I meandered down around 9 o'clock in the morning, which meant that I was in the front of the massive crowd that showed up. Here we are , freezing, out in the January rain, unprepared but not wanting to lose out spot.  We huddled together. I have nine  uncomfortable , blue lipped hours invested in Meghan and Harry and so it is of interest to me that they are left alone and given permission to live their  exceptional lives. Who can even wonder why they abandoned ship!  ( you have seen \"The Crown\")  Meghan and Harry were so close  to us that I could have given them herpes if I had any to give. Charming, adorable ,genuine and friendly,   I wish them well- I wish the Queen well, but the whole royal thing escapes me. I would run away too. Seriously doubt that I will watch the interview with Oprah, I will just keep this memory, thank you. I had to go to the post office yesterday, I have not been out for a while , feeling a bit cocky having had one injection and wearing two masks , I went to the \"other people's stuff stores \".  Found a couple of these Federal glass , Danish rooster, Irish coffee mugs from mid century coolness.And the sock monkey (above) Not sure why , but hand blown clear glass catches my  eye  every time,  stacks and stacks of glass this and that - row upon row of glass everything. BOING, eye caught!It is the imperfection and the clarity of the glass , the bit of wobble. The shape of this one is especially appealing with its fold over rim. So cute! So cheap!First blossom of the season from the little plum. It was not much more than a stick when Erik received it for a birthday when he was in elementary school. Odd to give a little tree to a kid for a present instead of the most awesome toy in the shop...but this made sense, the lad loves plants."},

I suppose it has a specific purpose for weaving  but it is like felting marshmallow, thick and spongy. Might make a good cushion top. The purple/blue  \"top\" was being tossed out. There was not much of it but enough to cover whatever this is. When ever there are failures I immediately think- pincushion. This would make a hefty one, I must say. As I have stated before, I rarely know what I am doing- life is an experiment.I will not spoil anything here - watched all of  Netfix \"Murder among the Mormons\"  last night which is worthy to be sure and not at all what you may think. That age old question of \"What's real\". Which takes me to conspiracy theories (religion) and why they have taken hold. Once lies are established, once trust has been broken, anything is possible.

Bear SO glad that he immediately stood on his head, which he is prone to do when over joyed, even though it does make his tummy growl.   Nat squealed and said \"I can do that!\" And so, they stood on their heads until they felt  hungry. Bear growled,  \"I love you , Nat.\" and Nat whispered, \" I love you, Bear\". They then disappeared into the kitchen  for a nosh. They  found  raisins , dropped  by Bugsley , who told them that it was rabbit poo.  Nat and Bear ate them  all and laughed and laughed, and said \"yum-yum, we love to eat poo, won't Bugsley be surprised.\"  -0-On the morning deck ( I wish I could foster  a bit of  optimism, I lean to the dark side) pretty sure that the baby had died, and what do you know- there she is, looking  mighty  rough and skinny but eating and drinking and splashing in the cake pan. Her vision is  compromised , her ears are tattered, and you can see - she is pretty messed up. Baby's back! I wish I could  take better  care of her. Trapping her would be too scary and stressful for her so, I am putting all of my chips on mother nature. Fingers crossed.These two are Mr. and Mrs. Bhang. They bully everyone rudely and loudly. When I show them my broom, they scoot, looking over shoulder all  attitude and squawks, marching about seven inches, turning right around to come back, insisting that Raccoon and Squirrel and Peg get lost. They like each other very much, which is a  good thing. They have no other friends.  Stay well, especially if you live in Texas or Mississippi, The governors  there are nutso , trying to  kill their constituents  and use it against immigrants and Biden's humane policy.

When Josh lived with us, this,  his favorite hat, knit especially for him , ended up in the laundry - shrunk down to mouse size.  he was sad... Should I cut it up and use it for - something?  a cat toy? I have felt so awful about the hat for so long - poor Josh losing one of his favorite things due to my carelessness. Ok, so, it has been  decided , nothing to lose- try the \"restore hope\" recipe which is; Loads of conditioner ( I used  Humectress) in warm water, let soak for a couple of days. Remove and tug at the stitches loosening them all around the hat, pull and tug and fist, and then do that some more, and again.  It was looking hopeless but two days later it is reasonable! It may just work for him . ( me, undoing past wrongs....like a twelve step program, sort of, I have more than twelvtyhundred  to go.)I made this  head out of a styro form and wet felt, needle felt, with rocks in the bottom for ballast. It is kind of creepy but that is how I roll - it does function well as  hat holder and as a pin cushion, Josh's hat looks pretty good considering it was the size of a silver dollar loaded with sorry guilt for many years in  the bottom of the drawer of unfinished business .If this hat works I will have checked off one thing from my  massively long list of  \"oops\". I reckon that I will have to live another seventy years to clear this samsara. Buddha knows that  coming back to human existence one more time is not preferable. What -evs- who knows anything really, just know that , for me, it feels good to right one hat wrong!  Praise  Humectress!"},

It was an experiment, pulling wool from one inside layer (there are five)  through scissored bits and re-felting them into points.  Maple decided to do something about its perceived  disposition, she dressed up, and carried her baby deer over to cheer it . I think it may have softened  somewhat... This is a bad photo but you get the gist, right? Maple thanked her baby deer and asked if she could give it a kiss. Which is nothing like  sexual harassment. In fact the whole Cuomo thing makes me quite irritable and cross. He did not sexually harass, grab anyone by the kitty cat, rape, or threaten loss of job IF. I am calling BS on the \"me too\" implication, diminishing actual sexual harassment , making a mockery of legit   \"Me Too\" issues.  As was done with Al Franken. THAT was capital BS!!Gov. Cuomo  has been and still is the voice of reason, unyielding to pressures from the   folks he may have irritated.  New York needs him- he is no Howdy Doody  glad hander, nor is he a predator.  My irritable bowl rather suits me today,  pissed off about this stupid shenanigan.And here is Peg, our one legged gull who has been coming around daily for three years now. She is polite, I give her tuna and kibbles and cheese. I think that she is amazing!  The injured raccoon baby has not returned. I will continue to look for her and to put out an egg in hopes that she will find it. This was taken through the dirty rain splattered glass but you can see the stem of her non functioning leg. She gets by just fine. It has taken three years of being gentle with her but she is finally pretty docile with me- but still cautious, as all wild things ought.Here is some good news-This is the new Albany County Laramie Wyoming Sheriff , Aaron Appelhans. The county is 3X the size of Rhode Island- there are 650 POC out of 39,000, Wyoming is ultra conservative and racist as hell. This is a giant baby step but then ,of course, it is Laramie, sweet little liberal pocket in the land of trump flags Guns, misogyny, and you know, all that is a detriment to democracy, which fails utterly in the face of ill-educated voters.  I say, Socrates died for nothing but a courageous stab at it.a stab"},

Dennis is making it all possible because it is eat right or die. He can handle little bits of banana bread and maybe two grapes but since they are the size of a cow's eye, two grapes really count as four. I noticed on ETSY that some are sending out their items using Fed X instead of USPS.

I am scheduled for the second jab mid March, YAHOO!  Perseverance- Mars landing and covid jab getting, all in a name!This morning, just now, one baby showed up . Oh dear. Big chunk missing as you can see, and another gouge in  her cheek, deep wounds, but the eye is still there.  Poor baby. Rough neighborhood. I gave her kibbles and fresh water. She lay on her side for a while but did not nap.  DAMN.The cherry tree is sprouting lichen and buds. The wind is high and howling.  dark clouds racing each other to see who can get to Eastern WA the fastest, carrying quenching rain to dump on the semiarid steppe.  The mountains in between usually stop the rain and the desert over yonder remains dry. Bunch of republicans over there so just as well. Nat has a new (old) fire engine, given to me by a friend whose husband had it as a child about 70 years ago. The ladder is stuck but it is in fine condition and will still do the job. Nat also has a new outfit that I stitched haphazardly in about twenty minutes by hand, because the machine said \"nope\".. Cashmere trousers and scarf from torn up sweater, so soft it just makes you want to poop.  Borrowed the hat from a bean boy.

Found a place to park, got in line, filled out paper work at the back of the line, By 9:00 the vaccines were gone. Came home, got a message from Janet that Rite Aid was taking appointment only- filled out the form about fifty times trying to find available time. Finally found one for Thursday afternoon, hoping like hell that by that time they have not run out. This is the bumper sticker I parked behind.Got some clothing together for Ms. Fecundity, roomier generous things that are probably too uncool for her but  she can decide. I drove them over to her house, but got the address wrong, came back home, looked it up again and of course i remember passing it thinking that \"that can not be the house where our girl lives\"...It is funky I must say, Remember being that age? We would live in anything. BUT it is homey and there are chickens and the aroma wafting from the kitchen smelled like Mom's home cooking- all is well. Covid vaccine roulette- but I think that with an appointment i may have a chance- The second place where I went this morning advised  all to get there by 6:00 am tomorrow, they do not start jabbing until 8:00- just like today, wait out in the cold for two hours, only to be turned away because it is a mob! One zillion folks showing up, elderly of course because that is the rule- who knew that there were so many old folks here that could still drive! So, fingers crossed i will get the first jab on Thursday.

And the child is remarkably gorgeous...Too far away to go see her and there is covid to consider, always...anyway, it was beyond great to see Stella and have a natter. Speaking of NATter. Nat decided to teach the new beagles some tricks to star in her circus. They are very short. Nat was patient-giving them every opportunity and much encouragement  to accomplish jumping through the hoop.They did not comply, ( so, I ate them) Nat was not sad about that because another animal ,much better  at tricks, showed up! The very clever, Mr. Cat that Sarah made from stabbed wool.\"I can do that easily,\" Mr Cat  said, \"with my eyes closed!\". Voila! First try, perfect! YAY Cat!They are a great team , Nat and the Cat, and the little beagles, well, they are not good at jumping but they are good at being eaten.  Every body is good at something.Nat was not expecting an audience as today was the day that Maple and Marden were  playing marriage.

Church man said \"AMEN. SWELL\"He accepted  a heart shaped stone as payment, and wished them well, to honor and cherish and behave , at least until dinner time. \"You may now hold hands\". And they did.They asked me to  take a formal photo of the event . They looked their best! Maple is wearing a high fashion  panty veil borrowed from large Barbie's underwear stash.  It's FRENCH + three dresses because each was just as good as the other, not one got left out.  Marden wearing her \"be Brave hat\" with an outfit put together by Maple, Good job that she has a sense of style.. It was a splendid affair. They had heard many stories, from Nat who is well versed in all things, about what is marriaged for most folks. Nat said  that from  a book she learned that mostly the married went to live sometimes together and sometimes not- in a rather nice dog house for a good deal of the time, especially if one or the other got too sassy. Which suits Marden and Maple just fine. There are still a few beagles left, now they will have a place to live, at least until dinner time.  All is well.Don't worry, I did some adulting today, honest! Laundry, made congee out of Helen,  listened to Dennis read from his family tree thing, a diary of sorts.. His great grandfather bought slaves  in order to free them and give them land to call their own.

They are still at it , being all Q-anon crazy -though have removed their banners and replaced their lit up trump sign with a \"We The People \" sign.  Thank you, LORD!! Now if you could just give them a nudge off the edge of the flat earth, that would be swell. The humming birds are disappointed.

It is snowing more now, likely through the day. I have Chicken and peppers and Scoops to see us through.  Lunch on the deck?

The day looks promising, but then , moments later....The weather changes in a nanosecond - brings darkness and a few snow flakes. Winter is predicted for the next few days. I was cleaning out the large bottle that I inherited, it was full of dried leaves and bugs and house dust sludge. I let it soak overnight and it was glad. Bubbles tickling it clean!  It is having fun now.Mailman came early so I put on six layers to go down the street to collect it. And what to my wondering eyes! A lovely card with fabric swatch inside to love and cherish! Thank you Ms. Fresca, of the North country! She reckoned that the fabric would be put to good use in honor of the little deck family. If I quilted I would include it , but I don't. I have tried ,in the long ago, to quilt, to cover a bed with wonder, but I failed after about two inches.  Below is a quilt I rescued from my Mother's closet before it went to some one else, actually Mom said I could have it IF I promised to take good care of it.  I remember it well- It lived  in the closet- too good to use, my mother reckoned. When My parents got married , they eloped , ran away from my mother's step father who had his rifle loaded and was looking to murder my Dad...They ran to Laramie to marry,  and then to Cheyenne to Grampa's house. The lady next door fell in love with my mother ( because who wouldn't)  and gave her this quilt.  \"Mrs. Mackey's quilt In The Closet\" is now out and about, christened with a tea splat just this morning! I can not be trusted....sorry, Mom.Mrs. Mackey must have spent  millions of years making this double bed quilt, all hand stitched ! Tiny perfect stitches!Fabric in excellent  nick, from the 1920's.  Well done, Mrs, Mackey!

Don't let others tell you otherwise. You are not to be judged for snoozing ALL day. Sleep , probably better than a jar full of magic.  Covid damages nerves  disrupting sleep patterns having survived the initial illness.  Effects of having covid clearly are not \"just get over it\" , like a bad cold . Also curious about hypnosis and its curative effect. Stay home y'all. Just do it! Don't fuck with this virus! Sleep!!Here is another fright!                          -O- The cherry tree trunk now is about four  times larger than it was as you can see from  years ago.Must have been a  graft, the tree was supposed to be a decorative dwarf cherry but it has grown to be a giant. The cherries never develop fully, usually  are eaten straight away by the birds, or  gravity bounces them to  the ground If we stay here much longer I am pretty sure that the trees will become so old they might  just fall over or be taken out by some chainsaw maniac.   The plum this morning , Limb tango, perfectly fitted to one another.  It was supposed to be dwarfed as well. Not as gigantic as the cherry but certainly not a dwarf. She is more aged, but still the star of the back yard!Here is an easy project for you- I have posted this idea in the past but it's a good one so...here you go. again...I am lacking imagination.Go out to the curb and gather some leaves and twigs. Put some adhesive goop on a canvas, place the  compost on it in some sort of arrangement, Allow to dry - Some of it will stick and some of it will peel off, leaving an imprint . Throw some paint at it. Spray with a fixative. It is surprising that this has remained  so  seemingly permanent and solid  considering the organic nature of the leaves and twigs.  An experiment that panned out, easy to do, no skill required. This is my old flower press , which I rarely use. last night on \"Escape to the Chateau\", Angel made an enormous flower press to press the garden onto the walls of the new room. Good idea but , in the end, looks like they are not  very secure. Anyway, as they do everything in a large way, Angel used ply board  with loads of heavy boxes on top to press long flowers, like iris and gladiola. All you need is  Chateau massive space to press your garden.  Spring is right around the corner they predict. Nothing better to do than flatten flowers...as I stated before, I am \"lacking imagination\" and am going to go  back to sleep. Still no vaccines available, as the virus mutates it its surreal virus way, trying to balance the  out of control population , perhaps. Stating the obvious, just stay home and be glad you have a home to stay in. ( there are over 1000 homeless in our little town).  Little houses have been built, gated, organized,  and have been successful, the people living in them are vetted and the community has been a welcomed relief, but not all homeless qualify,  a problem  much more complex , as you know. Stay well and count your lucky stars, y'all!"},

I ordered these from TePe , Malmo Sweden, produced using 100% green energy , solar roof top panel facility. Toothpaste , also arrived , manufactured in India  , hmmm, we shall see...sounds promising. the claims sound a bit too much like  internet hawkery. Not expensive so why not, I reckon, as being long in the tooth creates sensitivity. worth a try. Armor for TeethThe unique technology behind Dr. Collins BioMin Restore Plus toothpaste provides LOWER Fluoride content with LONG LASTING performance (for up to 12 hours).BioMin Restore Plus is the first bio-glass toothpaste with fluoride to get FDA approved to alleviate sensitive teeth. The unique formulation contains BioMin F, a patented non-irritating ingredient combination of calcium, phosphate, silica, and fluoride.When BioMin F comes into contact with saliva, it creates a chemical that is structurally similar to tooth mineral. It then attaches and seals porous tooth structure, thereby reducing tooth sensitivity and making the tooth more resistant to damage.This also came in the post from Lizzie in Norway, what is left of her flower garden, the fragrance is like a walk on a  sunny summer's day. Most welcomed- today is  wintery, PNW chill to the bone.The raccoons have gone back to the forest now, leaving a cake pan full of mud, the door  mud caked nearly to the handle, clever little mud babies will likely be able to open it on their own soon .

As if she  needed a reminder of my birth...this is huge ,solid and weighty, the weight of raising a girl child in the fifties. Anyway, My Mom appreciated Native culture with a sort of reverence ,rare during those years in rootin' tootin' Wyoming. She appreciated Sheep wagons and sheep herders, also with reverence and admiration. The poor native men defeated by the bottle , horizontal on front street , did bring a \"tsk-tsk\" but there was compassion and sorrow in that  idiom of seeming  judgement.  Anyway... Mom bought this in celebration of a daughter born in a turquoise stone month. One day Mom drove up to the Shoshone Nation, 125 miles, two hour drive each way, to see her friend. Driving 125 miles is nothing in Wyoming, so vast and open, every town is at least that far from one another. Mom's friend called to tell her that she had beaded a shield for her. Mom's name was Juanita, pronounced Wah, NEE , taw by her friend.It is still as pristine as the day it was made, Mom never wore it thinking it was  too sacred.Before i had ever heard of  \"appropriation\" , I wore the turquoise piece to a school meeting. The head teacher scolded me for wearing it. \"It's my Mom's\" I tell her- \"That does not belong on a white woman and you wearing it makes me sick!\" That was confusing for me at the time, but I sort of understand. My brother did send me an Apache medicine man rattle made of horse hair, bone and Elk scrotum. I sent it back to him, THAT was not a white person's medicine. See the difference?When i was going to school in Powell Wyoming, I had a friend from the Shoshone nation, Beverly. Beverly would sit on the stairs leading to the basement of the dorm in the middle of the night and chant/sing softly. I joined her one night out of curiosity, sat beside her, She had seen her grandfather on the stairs  a few nights ago and wanted to see him again...he  had been dead for four or five years.  He did not show up that night but that is because I was there. I checked with Beverly every morning to see if she had seen her grandfather- sometimes yes and sometimes no.I had to hurry to get the overly ripened bananas into something edible, Two of the loaves are ok, the third is sort of a happy mistake. In the bottom of the mixing bowl the butter and brown sugar had not mixed  with the batter.  I just scooped it out , put it on top of the batter in the third pan. It  sort of sunk and melded during the baking leaving pockets of gooey buttery caramel.  Yes, yum-happy mistake!Dennis's little urban garden is growing well, about eight inches tall this morning. HOWEVER.He has been eating the tender lettuce leaves when they are first born so the lettuce is three inches tall and sparse. It's his lettuce, he can do what he wants, but....really?

Green now but in two days they will be brown, there is  a small window of time, about twenty minutes that they are perfect for eating-  I am pretty sure Dennis had banana bread in mind. One of the few , very few, things that he can eat. Not much sugar, lots of butter and nuts, so maybe that balances the carbohydrate intake. Who knows. it is such a mystery disease.Received a book  that I ordered a couple of week ago . It came with  bookmark and a list of things that we are able to control during the pandemic. Sweet. As the ceremony was nearing its end- a black shiny car drove through the neighborhood slowly. Honking its horn ,  two massive banners flying larger than the car- \"Black Lives Matter\" and one for \"Biden and Harris\". I was not quick enough to get a photo. Usually it's the Q-anon trumpian down the street going by in her decked out car - flags and trump  stickers and banners.  When she goes by my heart feels sick, as green and hard as a Cost co banana, . The black car that went by today gave my old heart a jolt of  lively corpuscle racing, a bit like being in love! Congratulations! - All of us!  \"The Hill We Climb\" reads, in part:We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it,Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.And this effort very nearly succeeded.But while democracy can be periodically delayed,It can never be permanently defeated.In this truth, in this faith, we trust.For while we have our eyes on the future,history has its eyes on us."},

Our attention spans have a shocked butterfly quality about them it seems.  Having had four years of inability to land on any one thing has changed our flight patterns- fluttering continually. Thoughts- mass produced, obfuscated, ripped out from under us as soon as we land on any thing of substance.  So, it is refreshing to light on something solid - as clear as  water suspended in pure air, the same nature, as this bowl. We are tired.  Four years is a long time to  be in constant flight.  Land safely on a solid article for a bit.  And this interview with Ben Okri.  I agree, both , by today's \"tweet\" standards, are lengthy and may challenge   attention spans, I speak for myself. So  tired , but am no longer fluttering from this to that all over the place in a fog of Orange gas. Indulge a moment of optimism, here. And if you do not have the time for these two things, I will just \"reader's digest\" it all - \"There  still is  such a thing as hope, clarity, purpose,  light and honesty\".  The bowl  so clear it is invisible, actually  holds things, substantiality of clarity."},

I tried to save the ones  that I found but most were health compromised and I had no money to get them to a kitten doctor. I was a child. Did what I could, some lived and made it through distemper, fleas and starvation and trauma, found homes for them when they were well. My Dad who professed to hate cats and forbade me to keep them in my room, found a tiny grey kitten at the dump. The kitten had seven rattle snake bites. Dad tucked the little thing in his sleeve and brought it home. Nursed it and it lived, still I was not able to keep it ( because Dad hated cats, right?) and we found it a home.

Misheard as  \" I am a girl who lost my eyelids, the girl who lossesee, ittallsme\". Astonished at such lyrics I had to google Moana to get the straight scoop. I mishear lyrics nearly always.The first time I met the Pacific ocean, I was 3.5 years old.  I remember this day  as clearly as  if it was five minutes ago. The waves came in and whipped the sand out from under me, falling backwards as the waves engulfed me, tiny as I was. The waves could have been two inches tall but it was enough to slap me silly  and to know that I was helplessly being tumbled by a Godzilla force . Figured it out finally. Stay low to the ground and you won't fall so far.  Lean into the ocean , warm and weird. I loved it! I wanted to marry the ocean. Parents had a very hard time getting me  back to the high Wyoming plains. I vowed to go back one day.And so i did.When age was in my favor I  headed for the coast. Living by the sea is like breathing , you know. I do not think I could happily  live inland  now...( as we wait for tidal waves and earth quake that is far overdue- ask me about living on the coast when we are UNDER the sound) We owned a tiny  cabin on the beach when we got married,  Erik was born , we had two and a half  doggos, but there were too many limitations. Number one, It was  on the Lummi Reservation which I loved but we were not Lummi, obviously.  Number two- it was too far from town and i was alone with a baby most of the time. Number three, not a great place to raise a little white boy. We spent everyday on the beach in all sorts of weather, finding all sorts of treasure. I had a great collection of beach finds- old pottery, boat bits, jasper, beach glass- When we moved to town I brought it with me, such a fine collection. It was the first thing Dennis determined did not belong  so out it went. Me thinking \"treasure\" - he thinking \"trash\".  He was right, probably maybe. ( no he was not!)Nothing new here- nothing to blog about, just that my mishearing of the lyrics sent me down this track, and now I am wondering how it would be to lose my eye lids."},

The characters, as the series  rolls along ,  develop and suddenly become fabulous. The \"natives\" are mostly played by Hispanics, and about a dozen or so Native American actors and Lou Diamond Phillips (gorgeous)  Filipino, a bit of Cherokee,   plays the hottest Cheyenne dude ever. If you have not watched it, it is good cowboy eye candy- Deputy Vic is so NOT Wyoming, with her beauty and tight uniform popping buttons, never on horseback...Supposedly this is set in Wyoming, filmed every where but Wyoming.  I am addicted- the esthetic has me in its grip and I want to believe.  I want Walt to come for dinner and not say a word, get up after he has eaten a hunk of cow,   throwing  his napkin on his empty plate, meaning that he enjoyed it and \"thanks\".. Silence is golden.  An actor from Australia. wears levis and boots well , Robert Taylor- twenty years older than love interest- the deputy with the popping buttons. of course.  Anyway, It is a fun- to -watch series , the humor is  as dry as the high plains, scenery is lovely though NOT Wyoming.  The attitude is correct- Horse hair hat band, *sigh* it's the little things, the details that certainly spark my Wyoming cowboy crush."},

Going out to get the mail, was my only outing -starlings everywhere, trees  thick with starlings! They were imported by an Englishman who was homesick for them and they have been the worst pests ever. No body likes them especially the berry farmers. They kill other birds , steal their nests and kick out their eggs. They are aggressive opportunists. Not to mention that ,by they time they adapted to America ,they had become  scraggly and unattractive. Not as acceptable  as the English Starling, they never say \"sorry\", they have become American.The Pod, off shoot from Fresca,  listened to the radio and heard some one say \"Impeach\" and thought that it might be a good idea to go to the grocery to get some. They also thought it a good idea to shop for the Matkas, as they can not lift their arms or stand on their own and  when they do move they leave a trail of sawdust behind. \"They are from a different land, far from here , it is their custom\", said Nat, who knows stuff because she just does.  Nat decidedly wanted Fruity-O's , her POWER food and very favorite, putting two boxes in the cart with Maple and her  baby pig.Marden looked for impeaches but could only find pears,\" these will do\", thinking  that the Matkas might like  them for their tea. Nat decided that the FruityO's would not be  customary for the Matkas who seem to prefer coarser grain, like wood chips to replace the sawdust that falls out of them continually. Poor dears, they really have no control, but the pod understands. \"Sometimes that just happens\", said Nat knowingly, \" remember last week when Maple....\" \"NO! We do not remember!\" Maple said in her outdoor voice, and the conversation was over.They delivered the groceries to the  Matkas who live on the shelf, They do not smile or say thank you , that is not their custom. \"here you go anyway,\" said Maple as she excused herself , \" I have to take my baby pig home for a nap\".\"Oh, and I have to go make a commercial\" , said Nat. \"Sorry we could not find the impeaches for you but the pears are nice\". \" I will go now, to be a famous commercial girl on the pictureradio\" The Matkas just stared, as is their custom, and did not say \"goodbye\". Also - custom.Marden decided to stay for a bit and listen to stories, have tea, and  chips of wood as, of course,  is customary . Each Matka told her a story, story after story, about good people and bad , about geese and sheep and sausage, about princess Miranda and Prince Hero, bears, and water-nymphs. Some  stories were frightening - those were the best, mostly because Marden was wearing her \" BE BRAVE\" hat. So that was the day of impeaches and pears. Stories about good people and bad...sawdust and fruity -O's, Starlings and a blue sky. It has been a good day and the baby pig is still asleep.  Good Day and Goodnight, we say, as that is our customary custom."},

Of course it was not this crowded when I lived in the harbor on a narrow beamed sail boat made of steel. Damn that was cold. The bay froze that year That was enough to put me off- forever.I went out to get milk but ended up at the harbor just because had to change the scenery. House is pretty much old hat and tired as we all know. These were taken mid day- dark. Not raining, though!~ Keeping the lights on until they burn out.  The last rose from Christmas , looking lonely-  some hanging upside down , drying, the others in the compost , a gift for the faun carcass. Straggly lights over the front window  distract me from the grey outdoors, Illusion is good....delusion, not so much. I made four loaves of banana bread, one for the neighbors, one for Dennis and two to put in the freezer. The recipe wants four bananas , I had five. As a result ,the bread is more pudding than crumbs.Dark days, dark times,  this is the morning \"sun\" through Mrs. Plum's bones- do what makes you even the least bit happy even if it is irrational- Two more Matkas came in the post today.  There is a posse  of twelve now ,and they make me happy. They have  some pretty great stories if you listen.  They most certainly have a sense of fashion, Each one different but same. Also keeping my  branch gnomes out , they could come in handy as they are  pointy and could be used for defense in a pinch.

I will likely have to wait until late spring or summer time. The board at the grocery brought me some measure of happiness.  Stepping up at the white folk's  grocery store! The trumpians down the street are as horrid as they can be. They will not come to terms with their broken brains. Who knows what the orange criminal has in store for inauguration. The trumpians down the street love their dogs and their grandchild, they look like normal people but they are broken utterly, darkness dressed up to look like Disney, to \"pass\" as decent white folk-entitled, cruel, dumber than mud- with cameras surrounding their house and yard- paranoid.

No such thing as being overly cautious. Good news is that the lad got a job , very cool place just a ten minute bike ride from his house! Last time he had a job was three days before the \"incident\" , he could not work after that, so this is great news ! Moving on. Taking it to trial soon. Scary, knowing how \"justice\" works ( does not work) in this land.

Exciting- everyone out today was wearing masks and walking in the street far apart from one another. By \"everyone\", I mean maybe seven people all together. Streets are empty, no traffic. I can get used to this, really, there are some positives to being in stay at home mode for as long as we have been.Shops are still shut.heather stays healthy all year round. right now it seems to be anxious to get  spring time rolling. I am sure this is just a tease, this day of partial sunshine- it always does that. There likely will be snow again and a few storms before spring- Always a trickster and i am fooled every damn year! This delivery car delivering ice cream to Coffee Junction down by the station- ACME- probably has anvils in it. Not sure I would trust this ice cream.I walked down to the Ferry dock , along the bay, fresh  salty sea  air. The sun stayed in the sky until I got home. Things are looking up.We are minding our own business, watching Netflix, suddenly , clear as a bell, from the corner where Julio used to live, a cockatiel whistled a tune- I whistled back thinking that maybe a cockatiel got loose during christmas , as ours did one year. There was no reply nor fluttering of wings. Dennis got his industrial flashlight out to go check the roof and the chimney. I was pretty sure it was the ghost of Julio or Picachu, or any number of birds that have lived and died in this house.  Something really special- for sure a ghost!Dennis came back in ,shaking his head \"nope\" no cockatiel on the roof...When he sat down again he noticed his phone glowing. He installed an ap of animal sounds to frighten the grand children with lion roars., last summer. Somehow it landed on a cockatiel whistling and turned itself on.  This is the garden I got him for Christmas- it has only been four days and already there is a dot of lettuce- looks promising. So, as you can see, our house is blasting with grow lights. Dark days do not stand a chance. This morning I added a couple of paintings to my covid journal.

I looked up the \"WHY!\" The post office has been dysfunctional since  Dejoy did the Orange blob's bidding to sabotage mail in voting, closing down several stations, slowing the post, not allowing overtime-plus over 19,000 postal workers are out with covid. I am glad that the parcel arrived at all especially since there was $$$ in it. On to another action packed day- laundry, crackers and Christmas cheese, Maybe start making Valentines for the homeless as I did last year, That was great!

He ate it quickly so that his body would not know. Stella dropped by, we exchanged gifts.Roses appeared on the table for my forgotten birthday-Stella gave me a tea cup with a dancing girl in it.This is my Christmas present from Dennis. Civil war, you say? I am so ready!Another Dennis thing- He installed a WTF light  to help the sorry lemon tree. Holy cow, looks like we might be open for business! From the street it looks like an atomic explosion. I may have to take advantage of this new thing...grow medicinals, you know...for the war effort, send seeds, please. Poppies preferably.This was a Christmas card from our neighbors along with  a box full of  homemade edibles. 100% accurate.I will leave you with the \"holy flamingo dance club!\" of Christmas surprises- Brighter than the star of Bethlehem. Sweet Jesus!"},

Dressed up for Christmas, living in San Diego with my girlfriend, four dogs and nine puppies, one canary and one cat, all rescues.  At the time, I worked in a photo shop and she worked on a horse ranch outside of San Diego, we spent all of our money on dog food and rent, I was  a pro at pinching groceries- when I got a better job and enough money saved to send them payment for the groceries , I did so , not wanting that karma following me around, That was before food stamps or food banks. Anyway,  we were pretty boney but my skills kept us alive. Some days we would only have a baked potato divided into thirds, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ahhh those were the days.This is the photo I seem to post every Christmas- Me terrified of the wild cigarette smoking drunk Wyoming Santa, The photo below is of my parents and I going out for Christmas eve in Mission Texas-  we crossed the border to Mexico and ate baby goat with a mountain of peppers. My parents retired leaving harsh Wyoming for warmth and predictable weather, bought a couple of places in south Texas- I visited a few times a year.  My favorite people in my least favorite state. Find joy where you may. I find joy in this wooly pig, my spirit animal and the Christmas cookies that a neighbor brought over. None for Dennis. He would die so I get them all to myself this year, some are fancy!  Have a fancy holiday, eat all of the  cookies, mince pies and puddings. Once a year sugar rush."},

It is my birthday , a gift.  The raccoons knew it was my birthday, Dennis did not.  The neighbor brought over a gift- That is when Dennis realized .  \"Oh, is it your birthday?

My friend and other daughter said that she was having a Christmas toast on ZOOM at noon and would i care to join, I did, but it was not a Christmas toast -it was a birthday party for ME!! Just a handful of special folks whom I long to see in person but this is pretty damned special way to celebrate. So Sarah and Andy chimed in from my favorite house in  Greenwich, Lizzie from Norway, Virginia from New York City, Sharna from Kent, Julian from Southhampton, and the rest from US. Crazy way to have a partyAnd it sort of worked , caught up with folks- so good! That was my day- and it was good. Happy Birthday everyone!"},

Joseph is  poppy seed scrap, because he was an old guy and likely had a few skin tags I am guessing, ( experience) . Mary is a well used Lush bar of Sultana soap with a real sultana imbedded in her head. (  my fave), baby Jesus is an even more used ,of the same.Inspired by Steve's post about minimal nativity scenes and  Sarah's awesome scenes , Fresca's kitchen nativity, everything now looks like  manger potential. I have  lined up the garlic cloves on the kitchen sill, baby Jesus , a stem,  LO and BEHOLD, the angel on high is the outer white transparent skin barely clinging to a dried clove, it totally works- ethereal. I have lined up the bottles of condiments in the fridge, baby Jesus a withered grape wrapped in ham slices of swaddling, the angel-  a slice of Brie. Angels are French, as everyone knows.I read  a blog long ago of a woman taking care of her mother who had dementia. Her mother became  highly creative, after dementia set in, juxtaposing found  odd bits , nesting them,  organizing  intuitive compositions of  complimentary colors  -All  works of art!  The daughter fenced her yard securely , which was about an  acre  or so, allowing her mother to roam freely,  to find things, to put them in order, to create. Everywhere her mother had been-  kitchen, toilet, bedroom, yard, barn, shed- she left behind an assemblage. And that is such  a lovely thing.-0-The mud babies are fluffy for winter.

Mine is not  adequately minimal  -just  what was handy in the thing drawer, except for the star which I keep in a cut glass bowl because it is beautiful.

Using almond flour, makes it more dense as well as heavy cream instead of milk, Very rich, bland just on its own, but a good base for savory veg. Dutch babies were first made in Seattle 1942, a take off on German Pfannkuchen, the \"inventor \" owned the cafe on Columbia, Manca's. He did not pronounce Deutsch correctly so it was \"Dutch\". 1/2 cup butter6 eggs1 1/2 cup flour1 1/2 cup milkput butter in cast iron pan/skillet- put in oven @ 425 degrees, mix batter, blend eggs at high speed for 1 minute.Gradually add milk, slowly add flour add a pinch of saltMix for 30 seconds. Pour batter into hot butter and bake for 20=25 minutes. Easy peasey. Most recipes ask for added sugar.Manca's opened in the 20's,  long gone now.  A Huge Dutch baby with a mountain of berries and cream cost 90 cents in the 40's and could feed the entire family. But , of course, that was when a dollar was a dollar and dime was a dime. Beware of the waffles. Don't let the waiters scare you.Just up the street from the cafe was Alaska Outfitters, last stop north to get supplies. This was my Dad's favorite shop-.

Our trumpian neighbors have been given the boot many times for posting trumpshit. So , now they are posting code. A bunch of letters- I googled them and it is a code for q-anon right wing extremism. I posted the copied definition under her post- she got the boot again. Then , in my email, the most right wing off the rails , extreme articles showed up, sometimes three at a time from different publications, Coincidence?  Well, that is cute and seventh grade but it backfired because I am highly entertained by them, bat shit crazy conspiracies and neener neener-ness , Also doesn't take much to unsubscribe.

I bought it with someone in mind but failed to give it to her, she disappeared so...guess it is mine now. It cost 50 euro, which is a lot really, and the woman who made it probably got 3.

Poor guy through rain and sleet- I do appreciate him very much. Inside the parcel were two sections- the top being the birthday section, the lower, the Christmas section. I was so excited that I can't remember which was which because , as usual, I opened them all right then and there and squealed and ohhhhed and ahhhed. Oh my STARS!!!!Sarah made this book, of water colour paper stitched together in a  canvas  board cover-   painted , as only Sarah can do. She made the mask that wraps round to close the book. The most clever , wonderful object in the universe!  The thoughtful book/girl  did not pass or catch any viruses on her way here. Another covid journal to fill, though I am intimidated and do not want to mar the perfection of this book.You can understand I am sure!I don't even know how she managed to knit these gorgeous sox, tiny knitting- perfect heel and toe, I am mystified and amazed. They feel like whipped cream , exquisitely soft. Oh, Miss Wallis, thou hast overwhelmed me with  thine goodness!Years ago I found a Peking Opera puppet in a little antique shop where I used to get fairy surprises for Erik, as he was six years old- loosing teeth. It is magnificently no nonsense, keeps a steady eye on things , no body dares to cross him. He lives with Sarah now , this is a painting from Sarah of the very serious opera man. Brilliant!Above the painting,  for the photo,  hangs the ornament that Sarah made out of her pipe stem findings from the Thames.  Genius, wouldn't you say! Oh yes indeed! Happy Birthday and merry Christmas from the most creative , generous friend in all of the kingdom,  our Sarah. To celebrate further, I made banana bread, new recipe that uses sour cream- , interesting texture , moist and dense. Next time my bananas are on the verge of liquid, I will make more but add a bit more baking soda. That might lighten it up a little. What do I know, I am not great in the kitchen, I need some Mary Juju. I learned to bake when I was in fifth grade 4-H. Wyoming , high altitude and dry as a bone . Everything is different here at sea level under  wet heavy skies. Water boils quickly, cakes sink, cookies bake/burn licketty split. It is different. Sarah also makes a mean boiled orange cake which I have  tried  to duplicate-but pretty much failed, not as good as hers by any measure. So that was this day- made out like a bandit, made stodgy bread, time for a nap.  It is so dark my body clock is off completely.

I am here to tell you that , Yes, it is possible to waste time. I have so wasted all of the time in this day.They had heard that their neighbors, Juanita and Luigi  were having trouble with their new born, so the girlettes decided to help. \"Let's babysit! Let's babysit and be the three wise men bringing gifts to baby Jesus! \" said Maple.\"You , be a wise man, I am going to be Santa\", Marden corrected, \"and I am going to be the angel on high\", heralded Nat.Juanita and Luigi had  made a bed for their baby out of  their salad bowl- the girls didn't think that was  a very good manger. They sent the parents home with the salad bowl and made a manger out of something they found in the bathroom. The baby was  a difficult child to please, that's for sure.  Maple , the wise man, gave him her favorite duck. Nat , the angel, sang\"LO and unto us a child is borned\", in a most melodic professional angel voice. Marden, proud of her fluffy Santa suit,  mostly stood around wanting  to have her picture taken, because- OBVIOUS!!  looks splendid!Well, that baby just cried and cried,  though he was bestowed with the best gift in the whole wide  world, The Duck Of Murr, and Santa - RIGHT THERE in front of his very eyes,  and a  real true angel  proclaiming things that angels  proclaim in a most  accomplished   manner- little wonder that Juanita and Luigi said \"bye bye- have a good time-see you later, don't call us, we'll call you, see you in the fall if we see you at all\". They were   glad  to get home to make salad now that they had their bowl back.  Baby  \"Jesus\" didn't  like the  wise man  gift, maybe because it kept tasting  his  head in a hammering   poking way. \"LO\", proclaimed  the angel on high, \" baby Jesus  is discontenteth, and musteth be cuddledeth  on thine lapeth\". \"Fine\", said Maple, \" my duck has to go eat dinner, this game is OVER- don't like it very much anyway, baby's no fun \" she decided then and there that babysitting would not be one of her career choices.The wise man, the angel and Santa cuddled the infant \"Jesus\" and \"LO\" all was right with the world, at last  no crying he made, but\" LO\", he had cried so much all of the days that  his face  stuck.  ( lesson learned! your mother was right- it will stuck that way.) The girlettes decided to keep him anyway, better them than his  hopped -up -on-salad -crazed parents. \"Thus-all  lived happily ever after\", proclaimethed the angel on high,  until five o'clock, when Luigi came to collect the child, having had his fill of arugula, and the girlettes put on their jammies  ready for a night full of good dreams. THE END. \"LO\", Nat said as she drifted off to slumberland. Don't worry, I did all  of my adulting before baby Jesus showed up. Cleaned out some drawers, swept the floor , bought some stuff online for the Lad, made tea, ate a bunch of   chicken,  cleaned a toilet, Cause, you know, you better be ready when Jesus comes - wear your best frock and make sure things are tidy!Our   millionth covid Sunday, don't judge."},

Before their frontal cortex is even fully developed, they are going to be thrown into the slammer for up to 20 years- and fined heftily for their failed plan. I am not sure why the arms were so confused this morning. Hang over from the drama, maybe.  I went down to pay my studio rent, which I still have not really moved into. I like it already though, it is tiny .My old studio space looked out over the Granery with  which I have fallen out of love . The improvements are hideous. It is vacant and will be for a while I am sure, the rent is way over the top.  It is trying to be waterfront cool but slipped well short of that! Like a huge lego building , all old character gone. This is what i see from my new window.

Today it' s  more pronounced- blue sky above! Colder than  frozen slurpies  out there, but the blue sky is such a gift. An illusion of  sunny warmth.  I'll take it.I just listened to an NPR podcast about the vaccine- \"before the shot\" I think it is called, and all that must happen, the logistics and problems of getting the vaccine made and shipped. Rare minerals from all over , one especially that only comes from Turkey, must be mixed and melted to form the special glass in which  to carry the vaccine, the oven is on continuously, glass is made for the   billions of vaccines- measles, mumps, polio, rabies, the usual...but THIS covid juice will require so much more -plus it must be doubled up on because two jabs per person. There are not enough cargo planes 8,000 are required but in all of the world there are only 2,000.Not to mention the freezing dry ice containers, Dry ice can not be kept on the shelf for later because it vanishes into gas quickly. So, great that there is a vaccine- we won't be seeing it probably until September, long haul.

Rod MillerDecember , birthday month,  two days before Jesus Fruit cake,  winter solstice happens , shortest day happens,  three major holidays bringing light and color happen. ( Christian Christmas, Hanukah , Kwanzaa) December is most celebratory , also  is one of the three winter months of most human deaths, Respiratory and coronary,  haemoconcentration,  due to extreme drop in temperature and fluid shifts. Being born in the month of death gives one an advantage , If baby makes it through the first few months  of the harshest  , she will be a capable survivor.

December's child. Happy Birthday . Yesterday the bay , covered with a shelf of  \"sea smoke\",    temperature of the air is colder than  that  of the freezing water, looked  very nearly skate-able. I have never seen sea smoke look quite so smooth and solid, Welcome  December,  the sun came out,  the past four years of fight or flight  has lifted. I think that we will be OK-  Last night from the deck, with my point and shoot camera, a welcoming ,dramatic, emphatic full moon rested on the railing. The \"man in the moon\",resembling mother's round singing  face in the kitchen on sub zero  days,   \" Sing opera, Mama\",  and she would-   warmed and  softened, the   harsh bite of  Wyoming winter , served with her  hearty vegetable soup and  gramma's  butter rolls - This alone was well worth  the sticking around . Moon's face  has always been my mother's  singing opera in the kitchen. I can count on it in this hemisphere , sometimes two visits in  rare blue moon  months.  She did not go away entirely when I lived in the southern hemisphere for a time but she was  more difficult to decipher. Back then I could readily stand on my head , and there she was, upside down. \"This is not right, come home\".

As long as the full moon keeps coming around so too will Mom ,singing opera in heaven's  kitchen.  Lucky me ?

This is  Squirrel bird.Last night through the side window looking at our neighbor's Christmas lights, Minimalist- he texted Dennis to apologize for the Christmas lights and  to say that if they are annoying he will  turn them off.Not sure if he was kidding.As I was taking this photo of the  so -over- the- top Christmas display, I noticed something really bright on the hill above, thought it must be a tree lit up or a glowing Christmas angel. Brightest thing  on the hillside in the night, Just has to be something really good! Right? A  Holy vision of some sort, maybe.  Couldn't tell what it was until I tossed it in my computer.Nothing going on today, big surprise, Ground hog day all over again. I spent all of yesterday driving around the world with this clever app. sent to me in an email.Drive and ListenSome places are much more entertaining than others, Havana, Amsterdam, and Prague have been my favorites so far.  I crank up the radio choices of  particular country and put  the speed up to 2+ as fast as it will go. Cleary it is faster to walk in cities like New York and London. Driving though a small portion of London was a  driving snooze , stop and more stop -but made me yearn. Usually at this time of year I am there- body has a memory, sometimes during the day especially upon waking from a nap, I am disorientated - thinking about what I will do on this fine London day. I make a plan and then fully wake up- dammit, no mince pies for me.Don't moan, I tell myself, No reason- still breathing and there seems to be more promise of a  possible future - we will have a  real president again and a vaccine. I am almost excited for tomorrow, which has not happened since  we  have been/were/are  Orange gassed.

{"title": "Dolls, Balls ,and Larry", "date": "Saturday, November 28, 2020", "text": "Over the last few months, every time I see one of these Polish dolls for sale online,  I think about buying her . It takes about three minutes for me to decide. What is a grown assed woman doing buying dolls, you ask? They are  beauty-  remind me of my mother, comfort,  flashy attire , I love them. Their ineffectual mitten hands,  boots that match their  onesies -  skirt  matching their scarves, except for that one, she came without hair or scarf, I used an old quilt piece for her head scarf. The variety of  old /odd fabric patterns is  old world, pretty sure none of them speak American. I have little baskets for them, some for toting vegetables and roots or whatever it is they may tote, and some for laundry to hang on the line, a challenge for them. Lacking thumbs or the ability to stand - they are  very good at only two things, sitting and  charming.They are  over there on my sewing machine at the moment but they expressed an interest to come out of the corner for Christmas. Since they will be our only company I said \"yes\". I have a little tree for them, score from the dollar store! I Needle felted three laundry  balls that are about three inches in diameter. Coming up the stairs this morning in semi darkness, semi wakefulness,  out of the corner of my vision something the size of a silver dollar moved  ever so slightly. Thinking it was sock fluff I nearly  scooped it up before realizing it was Larry, the wolf spider, living under the lip of the stairs. He has come out of hiding , thinking that under the lip of stairs is a good place to hang out.  It's not. Later , Dennis with a paper towel cupped in his hand, ready to go down and remove Larry,  \"NO\" , I stopped him just in time. \"That's Larry!\" He minds his own business as wolf spiders do and is so big and lumbering that he cannot be bothered  doing mischief. He just hangs out waiting for a bug to crawl to  him. Slim pickins here, no bugs to eat that I can see. He may do better outside but he knows where the door is and can make that decision on his own, for now, I like getting to know him better.The sun came out for about an hour, glorious sun! Warming the sofa, who could resist such a cosy nap? Not this guy! Recharging his batteries before a trip to Cost Co Church. He is one of their most faithful, of all the zillions of people who shop there,  this guy is greeted by name,  with enthusiastic warmth, always glad to see him. Social life during covid, which is more than I can say for most of us with zero. I have forgotten how to be social, not that I ever have  been especially,  but now it has become such an aversion that Larry and the silent dolls are the best  and only company I keep on a daily basis. Stay well, do the things, happiness is in the small stuff, \"the Deets\", they say. Find a patch of sunshine if you can and a friendly wolf spider to befriend.  Shhhhh,   sleeps like the dead... sun is heaven"},

Many have flown into it,  fatalities scatter the deck.They seem  abundant , migrating through in a gang, but in actuality their numbers have dwindled in the past few years.  Their migrating pattern is sporadic , depending somewhat on the bounty of cones. This is the first time our house has been on their route. I put seed on the railing so that they do not need to fly to the feeder , crashing into invisible deck walls.Spent a lazy day, reading and fooling around in the fresh new Sarah book, Painted the first page, royally breaking it in with sparkly paint from Japan. It is water color so it glides nicely over other water colors , a bit of dimension and shine. Thanks to Sarah and Stella for this little book, again, the best gift ever!At night ,in the light, it looks surreal. Queen looks ghoulish, a thirst for blood?In normal light daytime- still a little bit menacing due to the eyes not quite right, so it goes. At least  the \"cherry  popped\". a vulgar term- but you know what I mean, Now I can have my way with this fresh covid journal. ( see how vile sexist language seeps through the cracks? how does that even happen?)I watched Hillbilly Elegy on  Steve's recommendation and was not disappointed. Fell in total love with young Owen Asztalos, such a dear  child face, maternal instincts  sparked over this lad. The only flaw with the movie was that it was not longer, more in depth regarding the cycle of abuse and from where it started. Granny lighting Grampy on fire was great but I did not feel it as it was meant to be felt, like some sort of justification for childhood trauma, hence lifetime fuck-ups. I just thought it was hilarious. That certainly was not what the director, Ron Howard, wanted to convey, as that incident was likely meant to be an emotional  corner stone. Windy dark and cold day, for the next few months,  same day everyday. Covid journal may not be as \"springtime\" happy. It may be too much of Japanese shine paint, bringing in the light,  but a girl does what she must do. I may throw some Dolly Parton in this book just to snap  out of it. May turn out to be a booklet of admirable women. I never have a plan for these little paintings, they just do what they are compelled to do, for the times , the day, the moment. Never know, life's box of chocolates covered in  light catching Japanese paint seeing us through the long dark winter. I would ingest or mainline  it  if I thought it  wouldn't kill me. No worries I have blue pill refills that will last until springtime.  Onward!"},

In the film ,  pockets of mist like these,  meant that the spirits   were trying to materialize, which only happened in times of crisis, as it took a great deal of energy to materialize.   I saw the film in our only indie film theater at the time, late 70's,  and have never forgotten it, it was funny but profound -was magic at its best. - the plot  - Greedy German entrepreneurs had come to a valley in the wilds of Sweden with the intent to build a sort of  DeutchlandDisney land, to bring zillions of tourists there  destroying the mythical , spiritual, sacred land that had been left alone since the beginning of dirt.  Giants, trolls, dragons, spirits, all sorts of magical beings thwarted them. I can't remember what role the apples played .  Whenever I see mist hanging in the hills I am somewhat comforted. Belief still lingers that the beneficial nature spirits are at play. We will be OK.The kitty cat who came to live with Stella, She was very ill when she showed up , and thin, though pregnant- birthed her little balls of fluff, they found homes, and this kitty is well and truly grateful. Stella, like the statue of Liberty- Give me your tired your poor- takes in the downtrodden fur babies and gives them the best life possible. She gave me tortellini soup  with focaccia bread, tea- and we spent the day glueing paper to paper. On the way home , I got to Underpants Jesus house before I  remembered my coat on Stella's chair. I did not turn around, I have other coats.Underpants Jesus  house in transition. The ghouls are gone, the pumpkins remain, and here comes Santa Clause.It was still light outside for about twenty minutes when I arrived at home to two books from the evil Amazon. The first recommended by Erik, The predictable fate, history repeats. Anyway This book was written in 1997, so at the time it was profound, Today it is scarily accurate as we can now  see this country's skid marks.This hefty book by Sapolski will be an excellent read, Glad that no one will be coming over today, I can get stuck in to this book and likely will not be able to put it down.I would wish you all a happy Turkey but that is not happening this year as you well know. Forget about Christmas ,too. I also ordered  \"A Promised Land\" - These three books will see me through the new year for sure. With challenged vision, mowing through books as I once did is not possible, so, three books are enough to keep me out of trouble. At least until there is a solid vaccine.This , from Rod:A Tidy CampA day or so after the funeralwe cleaned his apartment.There wasn’t much to do really.He had mopped the floorsand vacuumed in preparation.There were two boxes marked“Goodwill”.

Getting a head start. These are double / tripled carded so that they can hang without looking wimpy,  on a door knob , lamp, bed, chair, or toe. Old fashioned images printed from the information hi-way. While going through the pile , I found a few saint cards. I went through a saint obsession at one point- not sure why- the stories are entertaining, maybe that is why. It was after returning from Venice having visited  mummified Saint Lucy in her glass casket, Only about 500 years old, up close / personal, her toe nails clearly visible  and fresh like she had just removed her slippers !  WOW, a real ,whole saint in a box.  Stella and I loved her and her gift shop full of eye balls and holy water in a two inch bottle.  We visited her often. Now Stella has a dog named Lucy and I have lost a good portion of my vision, Saint Lucy is our fave. I will be needing her down the line as my eyes give up the ghost.   Anyway this card of man saint amuses me, Dog licks man's leg, man raises hand to say \"git\", man becomes  saint and gets a fairly useless wire hat. Not sure what the  real story is but I am sure it's a whopper.  Most Saint stories are tragically hilarious. A  restless wind is blowing today, creating an on edge sort of feeling - dark and windy,  flight or fight sort of feeling , maybe this is what anxiety feels like?  I probably ought to put on my big coat and just go out into it, meet it  head on. Have it blow...my mind. Instead I will likely just drag out more shine and glue , pretty sure someone  at this covid/Christmas time might appreciate a little bit of sparkle.  I will keep the saint, in case of  dog."},

Not that I am especially interested in the life and times of  William G. McAdoo, or his biography, \"Crowded years\", But the story leading up to this purchase is compelling. We have been neighbors for over thirty years, Our boys are the same age and spent every day all day together when they were little until something happened to change the dynamics of parental friendship, which forbade one boy from playing with the other, it was really stupid, overly dramatic and ruined a couple of little boy's  lives as playmates. Years went by , the boys reconnected,  of course and remain friends, the fire of neighbor's  drama  diminished. Conversations  with one another on the phone  generally a monthly thing now. Curious about her husband  now EX, his family why she had to sign a prenup, how the Kennedy's played into the family and why the husband's family rejected her and her children. How they met in Belize, she from East Indian descent , Spanish speaking and deliciously brown, beautiful dark eyes, wearing fuscia and lime green with a little orange thrown in, Just a gorgeous woman.The husband treated her disrespectfully  and refused to stand up to his family in her defense as his wife and mother of his child, kept her somewhat  hidden.  She told me that she had no knowing of his family until years later, not long ago, actually, when she was taking  political Science at the university on the hill. She came across this book , about her mysterious husband's Grandfather. So the political associations go deep and wide. The son who married the brown girl , turns out to be  leading a double life. Intriguing , pitiful and racist.Business man . McAdoo ,hired by Wilson ,decided to marry the president's  daughter, and thus became a sort of Jared Kushner in the works, though much more clever and sincere , not quite such a grifter. Rail Roads, oil and coal amassing great wealth and fame. He did run for President at one point in his career, but because of ties with the KKK and their strong support for him, he lost the bid.Holding a place in the book and staining the pages was this little clip of news paper. Which led me on to the execution by electric chair of the man accused of the kidnapping of the Lindberg  Baby. A german carpenter who professed his innocence all the way to the chair and beyond. As one thing leads to another on google , searching out Hauptmann, electric chair -executions came across the page. The glaring horror of of it,  the description of the process by Liam Wall in his book \"The Death Penalty Debate, and of the child George Stinney an innocent , portrayed in the movie 83 days.Below the photo of this day in the Ham ,is the excerpt from Liam's book, unpleasant, so I am giving you an out to stop here.  The horror of racism,  KKK politicians,  the murder of an innocent  child in this way- calling it justice- horrific America. This country has got to do much better than ever before- I trust that our new leadership will bring us that, we demand it. As for my neighbor, she is well and much better off, thank you.  BLACK LIVES MATTER more than ever - that  is our anthem.  New York built the first electric chair in 1888. It is still used as a secondary method in some states, and thousands have been executed with it since its invention, though some states likeNebraska have ruled it unconstitutional.The inmate is shaved and strapped to a chair. A metal cap electrode is attached to their head over a sponge moistened with saline. Another electrode is attached to the inmate’s leg, and he is blindfolded.Then the executioner pulls a lever, and 500 to 2,000 volts of electricity are released into the inmate’s body for about30 seconds. Doctors wait for the body to cool before checking to see if the inmate is dead. Doctors are allowed to check if the inmate is dead, but not participate in his killing.If the inmate is still alive, the process is repeated until he is confirmed dead.During electrocution the inmate’s tissues swell, defecation occurs, steam or smoke rises from their body and there is a smell of burning. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan once offered the following description of an execution by electric chair:“…the prisoner's eyeballs sometimes pop out and rest on [his] cheeks. The prisoner often defecates, urinates, and vomits blood and drool. The body turns bright red as its temperature rises, and the prisoner's flesh swells and his skin stretches to the point of breaking. Sometimes the prisoner catches fire....Witnesses hear a loud and sustained sound like bacon frying, and the sickly sweet smell of burning flesh permeates the chamber.”The body is left to cool further before the autopsy begins. According to Robert H.Kirschner, the deputy chief medical examiner of Cook County, “The brain appears cooked in most cases.”"},

Which reminds me, i forgot to buy tea!!  One can not make it through this transition of autumn to winter with out tea.       You can see how low the sun travels , along the horizon, soon there will be no sun at all.Glad i decided to take a beach walk today. Though I was wearing the wrong shoes, actually, not shoes at all- slippers because , you know, covid.I did mange to order clothes from Gudren, their return policy is a snap! Their new line is delicious, not like I have anywhere to wear new clothes, but I do appreciate Gudren's quality , the clothing wears like iron.  I am hard on clothing so anything that is forgiving  and comfortable I will support.Tomorrow will be darker so I am taking advantage of the oh so bright light at this moment-  weather is moody, just like the nation  seems to be.They knew that the pandemic would start taking itself seriously during autumn and winter , no surprise, trying to nail humans as severely as possible. Humans ,being what they are,   a soft target. After this week there will be zero leaves left on the trees. And there will be zero tiny flowers by the beach.Tree bones will mark time until springtime, Love this one, She is all attitude and muscle.Stella and i went out yesterday, It was SO good to spend a couple of hours with our Stella. We went to the so called charity store that is for profit and only gives about 5% of it's $$$ to charity. But it was fun, and sane, everyone masked, Controlled numbers of people allowed in, everyone keeping distance, arrows pointing in the direction of the flow of traffic.Came home, finished watching Doctor Foster on Netflix, If you have not watched it I would advise that you not.  Not a single likable character, an exercise in vindictive horrid behavior among humans who supposedly \"love\" one another.  The beach , round stones, no place for slippers, twisted my ankle and decided to go back on the grassy bit. On the radio in my car the advise is to get good boots, warm wooly socks, a weather proof jacket, several cashmere sweaters and good gloves. Get outside and try to not go crazy .Solid."},

Cray cray .Two are smoking cigars - the other  two - pipes, different colors of suits all bright.  They would be  amusing during an earth quake, I think that I might hang on to them just for that reason. This one is Ringo.Also came home with a box full of Chinese clay babies. Getting cold here, not as cold as it will get - acclimating is somewhat annoying. Coat on, coat off, Four layers, three, take a hot bath, shiver under the covers, wear a sweater and a coat, or wear two coats...trying to adjust.

Who was the actor?Dennis: You would know- the one with the buggy eyes, British, I think.Me: Ok,  then what was the name of the movie?Dennis: Don't know, but who was that actor ? You know who I am talking about.Me: An actor with buggy eyes  in a  British movie  Um, no,  no idea.Dennis: well, you left the TV on BBC, you should know.And so goes life in a pandemic.

It does nothing but make and answer calls  - a step up from the massive pager that he wore on his belt. I would be fine with this primitive phone, I rarely use my smart phone for anything other than texting. It is  wasted smartness.A couple of days ago I came around the corner and was horrified- a painting had been replaced by an old photo, framed nicely but what a surprise and I must say not a good one, I immediately took it down. He had this old photo framed for a lot of cash and put it there because he  thought I was pretty  cute back in the olden days and worthy of a wall. I returned it to the spot , after having removed it in my insensitive, ungrateful terrible person way. Not a fan of people  photos on walls unless they are of someone else,  or  arty. Sweet of Dennis to have been so thoughtful. The photo had been between his dresser and the wall for years, gathering dust- I came close to chucking it several times  but just slid it back  in it's hiding place -  either lazy or I could not commit.  Anyway- Bless his heart, he thought I was cute enough to hang.I brought some things back from the studio , this  felted head being one...I love the angora hat on her head,  from the sixties, French, soft and warm.  I made the head for displaying felted hats that I had made for a Festival of Lights show one year.  The hats are gone , the head remains, with her crazy eyes and pronounced nose.  She took a very long time to make - I am wanting to find a new useful  home for her, maybe a shop that requires a display head ,  without the hat  though, as I like it very much, it fits well- I have a small head - this hat must have been made for a child , or has been shrunk in the rain. Anyway, it will come in handy this winter.  Weather  is predicted to be extra rainy, extra cold and extra dark, perfect for the virus to succeed- we will be extra -staying-at-home . I have not seen family since last Christmas.Dennis also uncovered this glass ball in a silver  display holder- something he was awarded for getting the most people involved in \"Pursuit of Excellence\". It was a scammy sort of self improvement program back in the early 90's. Cultish potential I thought- manipulative and controlling, I thought. Anyway,  bottom line is that it was an exercise and a learning experience in how these sorts of programs work. Dennis still reckons that it was beneficial - I am on the other end of the spectrum- but, nice ball, something good came out of it, I suppose.something sent to me from my beautiful friend ^^^^ you may have heard this already."},

I never met  Grandparents on my mother's side. Grandfather got kicked in the head by a horse, Grandmother died in childbirth, and great Granny was just ...old. There are three little triangles of fabric that were  from my Grandfather's  baby nightie, on the trail.Little dots.My Grandmother and Grandfather on horseback- getting around in Wyoming - living and working on a ranch , trying to raise their little daughter to NOT be a wild thing.In the back of Dennis's bookcase he found my mother's book written by her friend, compiling events of Wyoming and the white folks who were crazy enough to venture into its heart, its wild wild heart.The photos of  our family were in the book.The author signed the book- and sort of drew a pronghorn on the protective paper covering the book.A sweet and personal touch on a book that only those in the south east corner of the state might share an interest. My Dad's side of the family came to Wyoming and lived in town, a town of maybe 300, counting all of the dead people... Great-grandfather came from Gloucestershire, UK, with his brother and a group of Mormons wheeling their \"wheel barrels\"- He stopped in Wyoming as the rest of them wheeled their way to Utah, the promised land,  Great Grandfather saying\" I've  had enough! You people are crazy\"- and went on to become  marshal- wild west.He married Great Grandmother, a woman from Sweden , had three children one of whom was my Grandmother, who married a boy from Norway.  The little boy in front was uncle Ralph,  who reached for a nickel that was  lodged under a RRcar, the train rolled and off came his arm all the way to the shoulder.Stuck a bandaid on it, adjusted , and got on with  business  ,  a career until retirement with the city of Chehalis, WA. I suppose that is how I ended up comfortably in Washington state, familiar territory. We road tripped often to see Uncle Ralph, and have crab louie with clams and oyster stew.  Nice change from trout and antelope and , WOW, there were TREES everywhere, Lush, green and carrots could be grown year round! What magic is this?  Adequate quilt wouldn't you  say? I can not even imagine hand stitching it the best of circumstances let alone on a wagon bouncing over rocky ground for way too many  miles! My Dad frequently took   young me with him rock hunting just outside of town . We walked in the Oregon trail ruts in the earth, deep and solid., marveling at the history on which we walked. One day we came upon a medicine wheel , another day we came upon an abandoned , out in the middle of nowhere, pony express station, where my cousin , who was visiting from California, found an old Smith and Wesson- treasure. Finding the old pony Express gun was the highlight of his visit, pretty sure.On the deck this morning- aren't they getting big!  Peanut shells and one egg which the babies can not yet figure out - the auntie scoots it to the edge of the deck to eat it in secret - after breakfast they roll around and play and nap and then they are off back to the woods- lion gone.Dolls made of fabric 1930's Poland, This particular style is my new obsession.  Stuffed with saw dust, I love the use of fabric, each one  different but the same.Late last night I got into a feeding frenzy and ordered a couple from EBAY...they are not great- bad condition but that is how it goes when one is not in her right mind!The ones above that sent me on my hunger for more came from ETSY - great condition. The others will be here at the end of the week and I will most certainly have buyers remorse. One's head is completely off -both are stained beyond repair. Lucky for me that they were not  too costly.What a dope."},

Fascinating, comprehensive deeper look into the famous cult and Sheela- there are no words...except \"mad\" - oh, and \"raunchy naked sexploitation, hypnosis, poison, murder and mean spirited tribalism and jealousy\" .While watching all six hours I managed to paint three little entries in the Sarah book. Murder hornets and \"distancing\".Made some lunch with loads of tea out of my studio cup. I do not advise tea with Grand Marnier, by the way.In a bag of loose odds and ends I found this 1920's lingual bar, and that's how they did it back then before adjustables- long, medium , and short. It fans out and looks promising as an art object. I can think of all sorts of ways to use it but, instead will leave that for someone else's wacky creativity.  I found only one in all of internet world. It was on \"Worthpoint\" for which one must subscribe and pay to see their market value.  So, no, Worthpoint, you will not get my dime for one question. Speaking of long, medium and short- I had a bone density test the other day-  x-ray from the hip down to see if bones are honeycombed. I don't know the results yet but the good news is that I am no shorter than I was at age 18. Actually I was 5'2\" at age 18 and grew an inch after I left home -so I have been a towering 5'3\" for the rest of my days. Dennis is now shorter than I am. How did that even happen? Trump wears lifts -  leans forward when he stands at the podium, probably  to disguise his enormous belly but also the lifts sort of throw his balance off. Did I say \"balance\" in the same context as \"trump\"?  Anyway, we all get old if we are  lucky (crazy) enough to stick around . Bodies do weird shite in the process. To be expected- I have a skin tag on my arm that looks like a 8 week old fetus - gets caught in my sleeve and cries at night, \"eraserhead-esque\" Twilight Zone material. I also have one hair on my chin that grows to great lengths overnight, Dennis has one on his arm, well, many actually, that are seven/ eight  inches long. No body ever tells you these things when you are young. If they had  done so , the surprises would not be so - surprising! I am not a fan of surprises.If you are old enough, tell me your  weird aging surprises or about  the time  you  almost joined a cult- Pretty sure that I am not the only freak."},

Here is the lemon waving to her friends outside, not envious of  the wind and cold temps, but not glad about the house heat either. I closed the vent hoping that she would not bake, Dennis likes to crank up the heat, he does not have an ounce of insulation on his man body , wears T-shirts and jeans, the forever summer man. I dress for the weather, consequently the house is generally too warm for me until the snow flies, then I am totally grateful  for sauna temperatures .   The lemon sacrificed itself - fell off into my hand as I was shifting the tree, so...I do not feel badly about consuming it,  the only  lemon child.Can't tell from the photo of the sofa but there are about twenty plants behind it  by the window.No prizes for \"Home Beautiful\".While digging around in back of the sofa I found a couple of very old photos that must have fallen from antique albums ( posted below the railing wild life ) , We have never had a hawk come so close. I barely got my camera in hand in time before he dashed off, sorry for the blur. He was large and quick , I was too excited.-  old photos from mid sixties.  Home from the fair? seventh grade i think. White buck skin jacket that I LOVED worn over a western pearl snap shirt.  Hot Tamale! Not sure what my hair was doing...didn't matter much, as soon as I went outside the 80 mile an hour wind would have made sure all the hair spray in the universe would not keep it glued on.  My friend's dad built this swing ( we were in middle school) to accommodate all  chums at one time, me on the swing pillow. Small town, everyone was a pal , Railroad families for the most part. A few Sinclair oil families. Common hard working folk. I found a few more photos, but they were beyond redemption. Having accomplished the  move,  made plants happy, cleaned floor,  discovered ancient photos- i can enjoy this Saturday morning - A wonder I even know what day this is.I think that I will maybe eat everything in the fridge, and then take a nap.Active as a stone."},

( wash your damned hands)The spike protein \"S\" is the primary focus for vaccine.Clever three hinged stalk scans cells- knowing which  to latch onto. It is also evolving as more are infected, It  just wants to survive, like all living things, I suppose.  Mutations alter the range as well, from one species to other species. Vaccinations are focusing on neutralizing antibodies that block  infection  by binding to S.  i am not holding my breath waiting for vaccination, as the virus is way too smart for humans. People who are not masked, washing hands, keeping distance,  staying home are utterly ignorant and you can thank them for the virus's increasing success and mutations. Becoming complacent is not an option. Weary, yes, but  don't be a baby-this virus is clever and is not effing wit chu.

I offered all three for less than ten bucks- just one has been listed for 125$ on the GOOGLE info page, dear lord! Anyway, getting rid of these sausage men with bad 80's hair was quick , of course, some video store owner bought them in a hurry. They will pay his rent for a month, and my Etsy fees for a week.Toy man kept me afloat. This is Prince Adam getting ready for ...god knows what-  maybe a shower or a bar B Q, he, being on the menu with sauce. Now I can relax and wait for my shop to roll around again, I hope that it happens before Christmas, if we all live that long. One never knows these days , does one? Then the sun came out for about two and half hours. Heavenly warmth!  We sat on the front steps gathering Vitamin D- as hard as we could. Sun, glorious Sun!Dennis is already moaning about the  chilly temperature."},

I wanted to mainline them.The thought of them now makes me nauseous, all good things must end, so they say.Shalimar was a Mom fragrance , her bedroom was like walking into a flower garden if that garden was in the Rexall Drug Store.She filled candy dishes with Nonpareils year round. Our candy dishes were always full. Because it was there, I did not care about it.Still am not a fan.She bought Christmas candles like these at Woolworth's for pennies, as well as turkey candles for thanksgiving, plastic floral arrangements and  Wyoming weeds that she sprayed with copper spray paint- and that is where I acquired my decorating skill...However, Dennis is safe from a house full of Christmas kitsch, just can not rationalize forking over that much cash for Woolworths goods, now costing ridiculous  amounts! The Vermont Country Store has become something other -  a nostalgic stroll through 50's Mom-ness, worth the time it takes to look through and  to recycle and to  NOT  order! $$$$$$$$Oh ewwww, I remember these! So icky!These are the Raccoon people that are left...look how much the babies have grown!Kibbles, grapes, and peanuts for breakfast,  so glad to see them,  auntie- or big sister, is taking good care of them. RIP Big Mama."},

It is always the silver lining of moving isn't it.  Getting rid of stuff, my god, the stuff I have shoved in the corners  for years,from studio to studio to studio. Driving up Cornwall, first time in about four weeks, shocked that the entire street by the pulp mill on both sides, parked nose to tail are vehicles -  people living in them.  A fairly safe place for them until the law shows up and tells them to move on...if their vehicles are able. After unloading some of my studio into the dyke-mo-bile, I  stopped at the market.Harvest time , abundant  fruit and bright green veg, carrots with earth still on them, and loads of Squashie Pumpkininy gourds.The pumpkin to be won if the weight is guessed correctly. My mask broke just as I was entering, thought about borrowing the calf's - could not be inconspicuous about it , so I just sort off rested my mask on my nose. Lame. If I am to get invaded by covid this would be the time.Across the street is low income housing, A more mellow color than the bight red it was . Nice paint job. Now I have to sort  my car, all of the crammed in  stuff of \"what was I thinking\" - dried out paints, bits of paper and mystery objects, sad wool, who knows what?  I finished watching Schitt's Creek last night, Patrick and David's wedding-  dear lord,  did I tear up, yes I did.  It took a while for me to latch onto Schitt's Creek , probably like all series, realizing what you are getting into, knowing the characters, accepting the crazy brilliant humor and intensely awkward moments., takes a couple of stabs at it- though Stella will tell you that she loved it immediately. At first I did not think it was worthy, I have been wrong before, but this time I was REALLY wrong! Daniel Levy, the guy responsible for coming up with this amazing show,  is an utter genius!  Catherine O'Hara is GD national treasure!!! I want to live in Schitt's Creek now, a safe place, a loving wild crazy grotty simple place. AND I want to be Stevie. Pretty sure I will watch all seven seasons again- in the course of a week- waiting out the covid 19 STFAH days."},
{"title": "You say it's your Birthday", "date": "Saturday, October 17, 2020", "text": "Beautiful day for a Birthday, Stella turned one year older and is going on a little holiday , leaving tomorrow morning. She and her husband are driving down to the Oregon coast to frolic in the rough weather with the dog. There are lots of places along the coast that offer dog hospitality which is probably the most civilized offer on hand. A party, Stella even made her own cake!  and gave me a party favor! We did not wear masks because neither of us has been anywhere.This is  the Finnish \"Long Drink\", delicious combo of gin and grapefruit. I brought a can home to enjoy sometime, middle of the night, whenever. On closer inspection  can  says \"product of the USA\".So is it Finnish? Is it a knock off? Don't care, it is really refreshing and only 5% alcohol. I have a bottle of gin, may top it up- 5% needs a boost.I left Stella's exceptional party,  Stella, me and the dog, while it was  still light enough to find my way home, I took these photos at a house  on the way ,where underpants Jesus is displayed at Christmas time, not far from Stella's - they could be best friend neighbors if she would make the effort... invite him over for a Long Drink- he could help her with decorating ideas, pretty sure she could benefit from such a genius decorator. he seems to like halloween  best.  He must have found a special deal on plastic so called guts (that look more like Chinese pork, bright reddish pink)  hanging on anything and everything  along with fried cat skeletons  - I did not take a photo of those out of consideration for your restful sleep. . He gets a thumbs up for enthusiasm and  effort , all about  the spirit of the hallowed holiday of Halloween. His house is tiny, must have a storage unit somewhere the size of Texas.Appreciate him spreading the joy every year, he is a devoted Weener.Happy Birthday Stella, young lady, another year fabulous!One of my few covid masks, which seems most appropriate, Fascists  and plague, human history.                    A good read, perspective, with delicious frescos, music, and here we are- again.On my desk this morning juxtaposed Coffee  peaked (haha) my interest in the day. Rarely does it pour into a tiny mountain,  had to get its picture taken because it is cute-  full of pep! Dexter ,photo that Dennis sent to me this morning  from his file of forgotten photos, taken at the cabin on Orcas island, years ago. The kids were little , life was normal, predictable, joyful, and Dexter was the best little dog that ever lived! ( all dog people say that about their dogs, don't they) Dexter was level headed, trained well by Erik .  Training  a Shih Tzu requires  saintlike patience, they are their own dog, thank you very much, stubborn!  Dex turned out to be the most agreeable little companion, intuitive, happy and cool.The only time he made a mistake was when Erik came in through the garage with a creature he had just made for halloween, it was about seven feet tall and scary AF.  Dexter left  a brownie on the rug, as he scooted into another room terrified. Poor baby.    Today i am going to the lake to sing Happy Birthday to Stella - best wishes and stuff. I ordered an Arabia girl from Finland , she came shattered, glued her back together - still looked sad, I was going to toss her but decided to give her one more chance, so ,along with the other presents, I will foist this on our Birthday girl, in a pot of heather,  better than the landfill I reckon, and a sad reminder of our cancelled trip to Helsinki, we finally got a Virgin Air refund this week.Have a lovely Saturday- do something or do nothing, it matters not just be glad to  be alive, for now.i love y'all!"},

They are not glad.The dying plant on the deck where the astronomy table is set up ( good luck with THAT)Used to be the beautiful blue morning glory and the mystery grass. I left the grass because the birds like the seeds.Chunks of moss are constantly finding their way to the deck from the roof,  slimy gobs, nature's poos.My friend and i were chatting on the phone yesterday, I mentioned that I need winter boots and have had no luck finding  comfortable, waterproof, good grip in the snow boots, I have ordered several pair on line and had to return them all. She was given this pair but they are too big for her, been in the box in her closet for over a year- She dropped them by today and they are PERFECT! Made in Australia about five  years ago, no longer available, NOT UGGS, better quality , double stitched, fit better and the inside is  incredibly soft and plush, Lambs skin. Oh HEAVEN! (sorry little lamb) That takes care of that! Boots are always a problem for me since I mostly wear Haflingers - my feet  haven't  any sense of form anymore, like pudding squished into a shoe. This winter, boots will be essential I am afraid. I can not get by  wearing  Haflingers, the most comfy shoe in the universe,  not good in rough weather or snow. Plus they fall off when running from a mountain lion. He has moved up a few streets but still exists or it may be his cousin. Anyway, the deer are scarce  this fall, for good reason.Five raccoons  ( Yes, the babies!) come around at night ,  night comes at  five o'clock now, soon to be four o'clock, living in darkness. The intense rain has washed the raccoon prints and trailed forest mud off of the deck.So...lucky day! An effortless deck scrub and BOOTS!! Plus my friend and I did not wear masks  like a normal visit, not because we are stupid but because neither of us has been anywhere since  February except to the feed store , the grocery, the nursery and the mountain- masks worn in those places, hands washed, alcohol wipes, you know , our new normal.Washed deck...Happy Day!"},

He was too large and probably too expensive, at least he smiled nicely for his photo.We had a ZOOM conference or conversation or whatever it is called, with the attorney who will be taking on Erik's case along with his colleague, whom, says he, is the best re: civil rights, civil action cases. It is all a mystery to me, The judicial system is sort of a WTF deal these days.  Nothing is straight forward, Clearly a bag- of- lies police report and the video that proves it to be so, yet  we must  spend time, worry,  and loads of dollars to take it to court. ( thank you , little blue pill, for keeping oars in the water)That was the most company we have had since February- and Dennis was ready to chat! He is a chatty man. he talks to MSNBC out loud all the time. I remind him \"you know that they can not hear you, right?\", but he so needs to interact, he misses the idle chit chat of the office where most people had a rubber damn in their mouths and he had to carry the conversation. Anyway-Cool Attorney - Erik got lucky . such a small, interconnected existence we have- The person who first looked at Erik's X-rays is the son of a good friend of the attorney - That is how Erik was introduced to and scored such a  treasure-  I was talking to my friend, Cubby's mom, She said she knew of a good attorney in Portland from their friend who went to school with him - turned out it is the same guy. And so we are a circle and isn't that sometimes the way life lines up.This is my email this morning- Christian  Cooper is such an exemplary person, stay focused! That was the morning- afternoon spent getting my retinas photoed.Same deal- Macular degeneration  just treading water until it sinks and I am blind- take vitamins, wear sunglasses, eat green things, nothing more can be done.There have been strides made in Britain with stem cells regarding macular degeneration, but not here, not now, not ever, most likely because , you know, fetus is a person, god said so. But did you know that the Orange Wad received a potion made from fetal cells that were harvested more than twenty years ago from , you guessed it !  A woman's  difficult decision ..Remember when we felt lucky to have been born in the USA, the cutting edge of science and medicine?     Sure did not take long for everything to go to shite. Amy Barrett- one more  for the pile.my eyeI also got my mouth stones cleaned- fastest prophylaxis  ever! I am going to a different dentist obviously since Dennis retired- I never thought I would be happy with another but there you go, I am happy. AND, he complimented my mouth stones and said they were pretty!!Compliments are rare these days- I will take it! In fact I think I will go back tomorrow for another prophy just to hear him say , \"um, pretty teeth!\"Back home with a cup of tea fending off any  Covid 19 that may have hitched a ride. This morning is purple and dark, more rain, and that is just fine."},

The forest creatures will then become competition.This one has been coming for quite a long time, he dances wildly at the door until I invite him in- Sometime he flings himself at the door and shows me his teeth. Who can resist? We have gone through about seven cost co bags of nuts over the summer. Of course the raccoons love them, and the gulls ,and the jays so the squirrel has not been the only diner but he is the most dramatic.   Speaking of marking days off of the calendar , mine came Yesterday from L'astronave, Fresca, The calendar is the best with ample room on the day's squares in which to write appointments and \"remembers!\" I chose a couple of favorites  to show you , this one with \"Racer\" underpants hat who now lives in London with Sarah and is having British adventures with two of her sisters.It is a lovely calendar, every month is perfect and charming and adventurous. I chose this one obviously because she is sewing something splendid- and then I ordered three of these girls from Ebay.  Three is just right.I think that I am finished with Stella's  \"Lucy\", I added flowers to ground her a little and bought the last gold frame available at Michaels yesterday.  Kind of Hallmarky but NOT Disney! She is parked in the cigar chair anxious for the Birthday party that Stella is throwing for herself, big covid bash- It will be Lucy and Stella and me and the lake...I have not been to a store since February-  culture shock.  I wandered trancelike, there were maybe two other people rattling around in that huge store- I marveled at the junk that people actually buy- I would have been one of those probably last January... unnecessary, disposable plastic shiny crap.  Plastic pumpkins for godssake.  They taste terrible.

She has everything a girl could ever want - she even has Lucy, the little  Royal Russian poodle. \"So \", I thought, \"I will paint a card for her. \"19\" X 15\" ,  kind of large for a card.Out of the corner of my ear the debate did go on with Pence droning on and Harris being less than Stellar, she missed some obvious opportunities by not throwing down some factual stats.It was an empty bucket of political promotion.  Kamala , disappointing. Pence the usual POS that he is. and when he can ovulate, carry a ten pound human in his womb crowding all other organs, leaking, trying to breathe,  stomach and lungs pushed into the throat, , spend about 20 hours in dire , throbbing, searing labor, give birth out of the hole in his PP, ripped flesh,  be stitched up, lose blood , lose sleep, have his mams grow huge and  tight with milk that gets stuck in the ducts ,causing the most intense pain imaginable, hormones racing, tears , inability to function- and then raise the mewing little thing to be a decent human on this planet in a society where guns are taking out children every day, and one with melanin is simply out and out  murdered, bullies at every turn, only then may he voice an opinion. Pro life- my ass- he is head of the pandemic task force. Hello.  Perfect- as the little wren that  landed on Bernie's podium - a shit fly parks himself on the dead white hair of Pence for two whole minutes.This is the real Lucy, cutest little girl! Loves her Mama.  Leaving you with cuteness because today is only Thursday and this is still 2020. We need everything darling we can conjure. sorry a PS-from the NY times this AM-Facebook is afraid. That’s good.Facebook is expanding a blackout period for political and issue-related ads in the United States for days or longer after Election Day — a period in which officials might still be counting votes in the presidential election and other contests.I want to make two points. First, Facebook’s ads blackout might be smart or it might be ineffectual, but it is definitely small fish.Look at your Facebook feed. A lot of the overheated and manipulative garbage you see did not pay to be there. Those posts are there because they make people angry or happy, and Facebook’s computer systems circulate the stuff that generates an emotional reaction.Yes, it’s extra galling if Facebook makes money directly from lies and manipulations. That’s a big reason some civil rights groups and company employees have called on internet companies to take a hard line against political ads or to ban them. But I suspect that most of the stuff that might rile people up if votes are still being counted after Election Day will be unpaid posts, including from President Trump — not ads."},

Intriguing story, raised by strict religious Mother and father steeped in churchiness, her father wrote ( sermons I assume) - her mother directed  church music. Connie was super smart! Valedictorian with eight scholastic achievement scholarships.She settled on Holyoke  , studied writing, where she acquired her nick name, \"Connie\". She dropped out second term due to boredom I think, and the possibility of making it big in the music industry. From there she was encouraged to go to NYC to try her hand at writing/singing music. The producer loved her, her voice is  wonky and unusual, her lyrics sublime poetry, but she was just too weird for the times.   50 years later,  she has a huge following, I played her CD in the studio so many times I  tired of it and gave it away in my basket of music that weighed about as much as a five year old.  But, If I need a Connie Converse fix there is always the internet. I probably have blogged Connie before, I am a fan, sorry.Connie was certainly ahead of her time, never married, went from NYC to California, To Europe and England , but the final straw was going to Alaska with her Mother. her mental health had always been fragile, a depressive,  but the  trip with Mom did it- she packed up her VW bug, sent notes to her family that she was off to a new start , no body would ever find her. she just vanished.Her brother reckons that she committed suicide hurling her VW off a high bridge into a deep deep lake,  somewhere in the Dakotas - never to be seen again. She would be 94 today, or yesterday, this year sometime.But she and her VW vanished.No party today.Mysterious, not an everyday woman- not an everyday story.this is more accurate , an article in the new yorker."},

As long as forever is. But you see the many uses of these hangers- recipes hanging from the cupboard so that batter does not ruin the ink on the recipe card, keeping things tidy-so useful! Only problem is that the recipe card must be as thin as a dental x-ray to fit in the tiny jaws of the clip.  These are not sold in any BOOTS or Walgreens, not sure why, they have every other word of the day \"superfluity\"."},

Under the curly willow protected from the wind and rain and learning how to read yard signs.He stays for  the afternoon, looking at the strange two legged creatures who make a fuss over him,  a teen ager eye roll, \"Oh , these humans are  silly\".  I painted Mary's hen, though her hen is so much prettier and impressive, I like having her hen represented in my Sarah book. I added a bit of silver metalic paint to some of the feathers that you can only see if the book is tipped. She is a shiny hen.These are just the few books that Dennis has received lately, he  mowed through them, no surprises in them really , Woodward's book is the most startling and unbiased, common sense, non judgemental , just the facts, and they are indeed terrifying. Of course Mary Trump's book is sad, also terrifying, Michael's tale is \"wow, that could have been ME\"- the seduction and game play of Trump is astonishing,  a very human experience. Anyway, all of these books coming out at the same time is a bit late, doncha think?Finally the sign came for Biden and Harris! It took forever and now we are just days before the election. Biden and Harris are not on their game as well as they could have, and if one is not keen to go online to view ads ,  or to watch corporate news BS, one misses whatever their ads are supposed to be doing.  The paucity of yard signs does not help in the sea of Maga blood red signs. After I vote I am unplugging entirely , already unplugged for the most part, have donated all that I feel comfortable donating to favorite politicians, not a dime more! You know how that goes, you donate generously and forever more, emails and postal mailings are urging \"Please, sir, could I have more\".The hand blown glass hummingbird feeder that Dennis ordered  online, from...GUESS.....If you guessed China you are correct.  It came virus free and has been a success.Hummingbirds stick around all winter , tough little birds, so this is a good thing to have for them. I brought the lemon in from the weather.Dennis babies this little tree and buys it things, presents and food - he would take it out for dinner if \"out for dinner \" was still a thing. He took this photo with a camera he is trying out for the purpose of astronomy. (probably the least satisfying  hobby one could have in the PNW,  NO sky ever!)  If this lemon was  a planet beyond our local  neighborhood planets, and the photo was this clear, I would be mightily impressed. anyway, it is a cute  chubby little lemon wearing pretty leaves. There may be a few more days next week of sunshine , I will haul it back out to sunbathe, and then haul it back in for the duration  of darkness, winter being just around the corner and time  moving at what seems snail paced but then I look at the calendar and realize how much and how quickly time has passed since last February, when we started staying home.  Like being in shock , time is a warped measure. More to come, folks, this virus is not going anywhere and is mutating rapidly. I am thinking that it may only get more intense so fug it, get a ticket to ride and go see my son, hug him , and cry probably more than a little bit. His knee is still problematic but he is doing OK. Dog and house sitting  - two of the cutest little doggos. Dogs are such good company.So it goes, headache finally dissipated after too many days of thinking oh yeah,, this is how it will end...a tumor probably...seems that every little thing thing becomes a mountain. Just part of the insanity, with which I am becoming well  familiar ."},

It is silly enough and cleverly written. Of course there is always PBS .AND the mountain of books Dennis has received from  evil  Amazon, Every book written by defectors from the trump tribe.  He watches NSNBC for hours at a time, with headphones, mind you. Falls asleep for most of it, Damn Diabetes! So he is cramming for finals it seems...all of the horror of these times-However, this may be good news...He is also taking a course on medical hypnosis as a tool for pain management and relaxation, that sort of hypnosis, not the bark like dog theatrical sort. ...He used it in his practice with some measure of success  early on, but it took too long so he abandoned it. He is pumped, passionate about the possibilities.So far he has been moved to tears from some of the stories. Hypnosis going back in ones life to clean up the trash, like trauma, wicked parents, sexual assault.Effective for some.I am a sceptic from the get go.

Often in my dreams I am there. Last night - another Opium type dream,  vivid , beautiful, not wanting to let  it go. I have said this before and will say it again, if Opium were legal I would be utterly hopelessly- happily-  on -the -floor-  naked - poopy- addicted.   When I lived in the orchard in Kent , I ate a wad of Opium smuggled in from Nepal.  I think that that may be what a good death  must feel like. I had another \"feeling\"  exactly like that- one evening in  the Brixton flat,( the one where the ceiling fell in). Overwhelming sense of utter joy , comfort, belonging, home , expansive love , light as light- NOT drug induced or human/ event induced -a  fleeting blip.  High!  Happiness - no cause/ effect, no delineation.\" Oh , man, \", I thought, \"this feels like opium, this happiness thing\"- some people feel like this all  of or much of  the time- I am told.   I suppose that is what meditation , yoga, prayer, ceremony , peyote, opium , LSD, are about-  making this  experience on earth  less arduous -more than ,(in the end)  becoming  just some grass in a plot or ash in a jar on the mantle ,having lived for a short while  in a  miserable human meat  suit.  I am thinking that now  might be  a good time to access that \"feeling\",  if it can be done so without getting thrown into the slammer. No faux \"positivity\" thank you -  no Hallmark card, please, although there seems to be evidence of   optimistic thinking creating more of this \"High\", happiness thing, BUT only if it is genuine. I could never pull that off.   I am wondering if this is the usual route taken historically , when  hope/trust/love  for humanity has been irreparably corroded.  Drugs, Beliefs, whiskey- it's all good...at this point. Judgement is a waste of time , none of our bees wax.

I remember carting around this lump of rock and a pocket knife  with me while  taking four year olds to the park, to the farm, out and about, instead of doing something sensible , like knitting, I carved a cat out of rock, A Universal cat...as it turns out. our star and planet, swirly wind on the foot.Peace and all seeing eye. a very plump tail in a garden of flowers. mindless , occupying space in my addled  caring for four year olds  state of mind, a bit of focus. I have no idea how this rock  became a universal cat with paws on head -loaded with rock heavy symbols, I just kept whittling  it away, making talc on my lap.Speaking of cats...remember toxoplasmosis? The parasite that travels in cat poo- Every  woman is warned to not go near cat poo during pregnancy, to be tested for Toxo, to be wary. Blindness and brain damage can occur in the child. maybe not at first but later in  a child's life.We had a cat, we had him tested, he did not have a litter box but went through the kitty door to the outside loo...so we were pretty sure Erik would be OK, He was.Now they have discovered that toxo may be a factor in motor cycle accidents and must test for it before any organs can be harvested.  Crazy parasite, clever parasite. Alters behavior -to not be fearful. High jumps off of buildings and fast driving, dare devil stuff, as well as suicide. One of the most curious parasites out there, creates a no fear  response in rats and mice ,  they actually like cat urine and snuggling up to them.  That way the parasite continues on, through the cat.Stranger than fiction, this parasite.But then just about everything is stranger than fiction these days.So, In case you need an organ from a seemingly healthy donor , have it tested for Toxo before you say , \"Oh yes, Please\". I am Hoping that you do not need an organ transplant.Stay well."},

Lime and straw...that is about it. A large Jay flew into the house and committed suicide, probably..He slammed into the wall having broken  some dollar valuables  on his flight- That is one way of getting rid of stuff !He fell behind the cabinet, I shifted the furniture and covered him with a towel- Lifted him up but the towel slipped, so he freaked out a little bit and I am very sorry...I put him on the railing where he sat for a very long time, injured. I cleaned up the area where he crashed, collected a few feathers, and a little puddle of the most interesting color of blood- Blue jays bleed  burnt sienna/purple!He did fly off, but  he will not be flying long, so jaded now that all I could think about was how to duplicate that  curious color with paint...( the locket is something I wore when Erik was a baby, one side photo of him the other a photo of  Dennis, cute, sentimental)"},

I found him, online.Of course he is the worst kind of bullshoes!!Supports Trump, anti abortion, anti gay,  Real estate developer that has been ruining lives for about 70 years now.I thought I recognized his name as he introduced himself in a \"Don't you know who I AM\" sort of way. So all morning I have had this thud in my stomach that this guy was going to have the cougar killed.Just now, the game warden showed up, with a police badge on his shoulder and i was pretty sure I would have to get out my broom, hunt down the cougar to warn him, to save him from the big ol mean men. Turns out , the warden is the nicest guy in the world and is on the cougar's side.Said that the other blowhard guy probably needs \"tough love\"...they have had run ins before over the blowhard guy's dog that got stomped by a deer - wanted ALL of the deer to be killed. So, that is where we are now, the carcass is rotting Quickly, flies are abundant and the spiders are loving it.  Warden agreed that the lion is probably done with it, if not tonight by tomorrow night.This is my abused neglected little granny geranium, they always remind me of Italian grandmothers.So there you go, Saturday  in the neighborhood."},

The cougar really is  quite magnificent.Nature , on planet Hoofnagle.Three little shorties showed up this evening so I think the cougar really has moved on- I sat on the steps , guarding them with my broom as they took a much  needed nap in the fading sun on the deck railing.

No lion\"Even the blue jays are acting weird, difficult to distinguish, they are always weird.This is  pearly everlasting. When I first moved here I collected loads of this flower thinking that they may dry nicely and I could keep them over winter, \"everlasting\". I came back to my cabin after a day of doing whatever , to find the flowers had sprung forth! Exploded fluff and whiskers everywhere. A lot like the cat tails I had kept,BOOM all over the room!enormous crow on the mountain,  this is the artist.Heather on the mountain unlike our  yard heather - hearty plant. survival on the mountain is not easy.  Blurry shot but good enough to see how very serious these little flowers are.So, good morning!

It is mostly yolk so when the chick hatches it is ready for college and a motor cycle. It takes thirty days for the egg to be an egg inside of the mom. The ratio of egg to mom is astounding. But when you think about it...the ratio of human mothers and their offspring , kiwi ratio pails in comparison,  in a different way- human moms carry theirs  until the day the Moms die ( heart/brain/ corpuscles entirely commandeered)Kiwis lay their eggs , hatch them and that is it, done, big egg, big yolk, youngins are ready - on their own, mom goes about her Kiwi hustle.Baby raccoons ,  stay with their moms for at least a year, these babies have lost theirs at only  a few months old. At least they know that there will be nuts and grapes and kibble on our deck for as long as that lasts...

They are overtaking the house as you can see. That is just fine, we have not tired of them and will scoot over.Tired of baby raccoons ? well, here you go then.Baby discovering grapes!drunk with delight,  hey! grapes are OK!tired of baby raccoons being cute on the railing?oh well then, here is one specially for you,a pile of babies .It is so peaceful tonight, all is well.TheD.A. after watching the video of the assault dropped all charges, of course, bloody obvious! Now on to civil case. I sent someCharlotte's Web  CBD gummies off to the lad, some for sleep, some for physical stress (mending), some for calm, and ordered some for myself, They just arrived. I tried CBD oil when I broke my neck  ,  big nope, hated it!! so we will see if this is better - a reputable company having saved so many children from  symptoms of illnesses not addressed by the big deal  old school med professionals. It is a company I think I ought to support.So I did.Just got a text, \"subtle , gentle, nice\" is the report so YAY. On to a sound sleep....zzzzzzzz"},

Asking you all out there in smart land, what are these lovely pods, They are so nice to handle , soothing.Messed with  rabbit  that has been laying on the table for a week or so...looking like a wadded up Kleenex. I call it \"Rabbit on asphalt\". Or \"Kleenex - Middle of  road\" Which reminds me, as i was going to the grocery two of the babies crossed the road in front of my car!  I stopped , rolled down my window and scolded them. They just got smaller , flattened like fur pancakes- hid in the bush.They are a little bit larger than a squirrel, you know, you have seen how small they are - could get run over Quite easily without the driver even being aware. NOOOOoooo, and they are still toddlers, not quick getting from point A to point B. I painted the rabbit on a used piece of heavy paper that also belonged to my dead friend. He had loads of  quality paper but the paintings he had done on them are all  mistakes - intentionally messed up.  Not sure why he would do that other than - he could. What a rebel. It is like \"see this expensive paper I just bought ten pieces of, I am going to fug it up! and you can't stop me\" , deep pocket syndrome. Anyway this piece is about 14\" square, not so big that it might scare you.This cat is on the BLM wall, done by a child . I am especially fond!If you know what kind of Pod this is, tell me, from six feet away, please.  They are just the coolest Mother nature balls. I love how everyone here has finally decided that wearing masks is the thing.People are getting stylish and creative about it,  pandemic fashion is taking off .Great, I like the trend.We will get out of this thing eventually, we will.Good morning, on the covid deck yet again...Last night big shenanigans- the raccoon family had an unwelcome visitor-  A GUY!!! he started harassing the babies so I had to  escort him to the stairs and back into the forest with my mighty broom. \"and don't come back!' I hollered. The babies were glad, splashed in the cake pans and ate some kibble. Rolly polly babies.This showed up in the mail box yesterday- A stamped registration for a blender 1965, purchased by my Mom, My friend just thought I might like to see her printing for old time's sake, and I must say it made me miss her all over again, like her death was just yesterday.... it has been YEARS. \"This appliance was purchased by - a woman\". The other choices were, \"man\", 'Both\", \"Don't know\".I would go for \"don't know\".Just now, squirrel at the door- \"GIVE ME A NUT!\" \"thanks, bye.\"Life in covid times- stay well, stay at home.Vote blue of course and try to not watch the Orange POS. Madness!Just to make you feel better  -  from a little book i bought when i was withSarah, who  knows the best places!

{"title": "it's been a good day.", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2020", "text": "Today - a GOOD day! Washed and waxed the entire floor, wax on wax off...What an accomplishment! Got a birthday present together for Cubby's Mom, left it on the front door knob, took these photos of the growing things by the steps. Came home , added more pasta to my girth. Got a message from the lad that he dug deep into you tube , hidden in the recesses he found the video  that exonerates him, Blatant police brutality right there !Something a mother never wants to see, ever. Astonishing that it would all come to this.BLMNew discoveries have determined that this \"Roots\" painting was the very last one done by Van Gogh the night before he killed himself in the field. The exact location was identified in a picture postcard found in a bundle of old stuff. a sharp eye caught the similarities though the roots had been somewhat covered in flora over growth. The area cleared a bit , now protected, a Plaque added to the exact spot saying I do not know what- Maybe as simple as \"roots, last painting by Vinnie\"?In 2012 \"Painted With Words\"  staring Benedict Cumberbatch as Vincent, came on late night PBS. Never quite a die hard fan of VanGogh, I appreciated his work and his very different approach but I did not swoon, and since i could not sleep I watched . Cumberbatch stabbed me in my center with his very real, compelling and heart breaking performance of talented,  dear , disturbed, poor sad man Vincent, and his gift .When Stella and I went to Amsterdam we did go to the Van Gogh museum, I did swoon, every brush stroke, pain , beauty- life and death tortured mind- the intensity , overwhelming. His colors and boldness and ease  of motion, the life force flowing from Vincent's mind ,  pumping from his big damaged  heart ,  through his veins , hand, fingertips, brush right smack onto the canvas I tell you - is jaw dropping! After Amsterdam we met friends in Paris- One day at the Musee D'Orsay  we saw maybe three of Vincent's works, that I could just not quite take in, overload is a thing. All I could do was cry.Our friend, the guy who took us there,  took my hand and said \" yeah, it is  exactly how it is.\"The Musee D'Orsay is top of the list of fabulous art museums in the world but be forewarned, nearly every work in there is bound to cause some \"feels\". It is the only reason I would ever go back to Paris, not my favorite city by any measure, but the D'Orsay, my god, what a gift to the world!For a light breather I went to the Picasso  Blue and Rose period . That is how intense the art is- when you look to Picasso for a  light breather you know that you are in the deep end.This Picasso in  Oslo on the front of the  brutalist building where that insane( never speak his name)  terrorist blew up 70 people, is being torn down. Protesters wearing striped shirts (for Picasso) are not pleased! As a consequence they are trying to preserve the 250 ton sand blasted Picasso work but still are tearing down the building damaged by the bomb.Which is a shame, they go together so well. So it goes, build , tear down, replace, it is the natural progression, I guess, until our known  universe extinguishes."},

Double not smart!Sorry if you are tired of my Big Mama on the deck...and her little family, this family is the only thing happening in my life at the moment.  Don't you just love her though? Her blind eye, her raspy nips. her good nature and mothering skills.She is awesome!They had quite a good party last night, I covered the deck with nuts and grapes and kibbles  so that everyone  could reach something without interference- Two pans of water- one large enough for babies in which to splash and spread out in. It was a pool party of the highest order.The Mothers, both of them took naps on the deck, one baby chased leaves, two babies napped on the railing and two babies climbed the cherry tree.Our  Sarah, She has done a wonderful Covid journal, though it is utterly sad, having lost her mother to the virus.This photo taken the last time I saw her. I am seriously doubting that I will travel again, and that is sad, too. I was lucky enough to have met Sarah's mother, spend a little time with her, charming delightful sweet woman. And I must say the Apple does not fall far! I do miss ourSarah!-Dennis really for real this time has sold the practice and is out! Diabetes is unkind- doing its worst ,though he eats nothing, once the pancreas goes and the disease sets in there is really little else one can do. He has controlled his blood sugar very well, a highly disciplined person and I must say , he has been remarkable  having had the disease for a  very long time, but like any incurable disease diabetes will have its way. It is never what you think, you know, until you have walked a mile in its moccasins you have no idea- there is mental  difficulty, fog,  and faulty perception, loss of muscle mass,  and nerve pain. A host of other symptoms as well but those are the ones that come to mind just now. Glad he has retired and can now just concentrate on himself, feeling better, less stress, which also contributes to diabetes.  So, yes, looking up....Tugs  in front of the studio on a beautiful day. Stay well, you know what to do.the only good use for a leaf  blower!Thank you Dads, The wall of Moms singing in a lullaby tone- \"Hands up, don't shoot\"- And this is how Portland does it,nearly  60 days of protest.the violence coming from the feds- assholes.leaf blowing at its best! never thought i would condone the use of a damned leaf blower!"},

It will be a miracle if they are bought.  I am not fond - because during the time of stabbing them into form, times were sucking and I was not at my best. Things go wrong when one is feeling wrong , probably shouldn't try to be crafty during sucky times. Like the disastrous bread I made for Erik.

Sleep has been a stranger as of late...you know.Anyway, this is the blind bear's nose and isn't it dear.Been kissed nearly right off his little non-seeing face.I ordered paper mache nuts from Germany, needle felted bugs to live inside of them.

How did that happen?Probably because I have been stationary for so long, gathering moss.I don't know who they are but they are both smoking and it is a great photo.The usual bad photo of the olden days taken up on Snowy Range where we spent the summers. All four of us in that little trailer.  It was not a campground, there were only three friends up there. My Dad and his friend cleared the area enough for three trailers. Since we were outside all of the time it was doable and seemed huge to me, I was not very large.  There, by the tree,  parked professionally  are our bikes, the only  way to get around the mountains without a horse.   The freedom we had  is unfathomable now. I was about eight years old- rode my bike all over the mountain, alone. Met a golden grizzly bear over at Olly Anderson's cabin. Olly was a hermit  , the grizzly liked to hang out there because- no people and it could eat Olly's garbage.  Olly liked  to have the bear hanging around, kept the children away, except for me. I was fearless.Olly lived in a small valley where I could sit for hours hearing my echo bounce around at least five times. The bear stood up on hind legs and was as big as the Empire State Building. I didn't have a lot of limitations, but My Mom finally asked that I not go near Olly's hut anymore. \"He is more cranky than that bear\". Olly hollered at me one time, I had to ask my Brother what \"FUCK OFF\" meant, he replied, \"it means ,go to the moon.\" Oh, well that's OK then.This photo popped up as well. The folks at home, My god, my Mother's slippers!!The decor, the pink walls and orange chair!  Pictures of their ugly children, me at twelve, my brother at age fourteen, in the bookcase. Two ash trays on the table, in case a smoker came by. Another world! My Folks , probably the only democrats in the entire state, managed to get along with their republican friends and have decent back and forth conversations, except  for that one time...My Dad said \" go on with you\" to his republican blow hard  friend . WOW harsh! His friend said \"well, now!\". and that was that, they resumed playing cards at the kitchen table. Mom always wore  necklace and ear rings , even in the mountains, and lipstick, vacuumed the floor in two inch heels, \"makes me taller so that I see better\", she claimed, but mostly in case a neighbor happened to stop by with a cake or something,  which happened frequently. she  didn't want to  appear slovenly ...likeDon's wife.Some say  those were the \"good old days\", some say THESE are the good  days. According to some this covid thing is just practice. have you heard that?  That the virus has branched off into at least  seven cute little off shoots trying to kill us all.Seriously?We are one inch away from total shut down again.The protests continue and the police tapes of George have been published, making the murder much more heinous, if you can even imagine!Stay in, be careful, the usual.PS. just remembered Olly's last name was Olson, not Anderson.

The upper class  were more than happy to donate, due to Queen Caroline's support, because who does not want to associate with the Queen- and who wants to feel guilty about the treatment of the less fortunate- sanctimony goes a long way.On Sunday the 400 children and babies were served a Sunday meal- Boiled beef, 1/2 oz. of butter, potato , bread or suet pudding and a small beer.The  satisfied sanctimonious came to watch the children eat and behave nicely , clean and scrubbed,  never minding the fact that they were motherless, left on the step with a token, dressed in whatever the mom could find,  a rag, or nothing at all. Could have been the best the mother had, a bit of lace, soft wool.At the time every person in London consumed at least 7 gallons of gin a year, 74% of children died before age five, 90% died in work houses- Gallons of gin, no money, filth, disease, no heat, no birth control, fetal alcohol syndrome...bad recipe. I came home and felted about fifteen foundlings, with tokens, dressed in forgotten wool and lace, little globs of softness.I left a few on doorsteps of friends.I have  four left, stuck uncomfortably in a basket . The basket is called \"Cherokee market \"and was a bitch to weave. Basket makers have all my respect!All that to say, YAY big Mama, the best mom on the deck- I think that the two smaller babies have been orphaned. Orphans, foundlings, tugging at  heart. As a child I adopted all of the horned toads from the alley, dressed them in tiny clothes and loved them until they spit blood out of their eyes- I guess my \"love\" was somewhat conditional , sanctimonious, maybe  but I like to think that they went back to their wild lives with a tale of kindness offered by a small human. Same with the wild life on the deck, My \"kindness\", which may or may not have their best interests at heart, has been a small pile of cat food and a hand full of cherries.Please, Lord of nature, do not allow this  illegal activity of human ruin the wildness of these little monkey bears!"},

I said \"Hi babies\" and took the front stairs. Big Mama on the deck feeling secure that her babies would not be harmed.I bought a couple of mugs for the lad, I will fill them with $$$, which he can probably use .OR candy cigarettes,  hmmm, which would be more helpful?

He generally includes a flying saucer in his work somewhere. Above the ferris wheel, the dash is actually a flying saucer, responsible for torching the chair?- or maybe  just observing folly of planet Earth's  human notoriety. You may remember the Covid lockdown painting on cardboard that I bought from him  a couple of months ago, I still have to go out in the world to get it framed, not today. It is not this large- taking shot with  phone, mirror distorts it into large.I am not feeling confident enough to go  out to be a normal consumer  yet, \"out there\" is not yet ready either.Stella reports that her favorite shopping place will not open, at all. Value Village in Mt.Vernon, her neighborhood  so called charity shop ,where treasure may be found no more.So much will have changed,  after Covid and Orange virus are  under control, once we get a vaccine and the Orange has vanished , \"like a miracle\" ,  May be a NEW world- Yes please.In the evening - the deer in the yard  own it, She looks at me like \" identify yourself, what are you doing here\"They are  ninja. Often I go out to my car or the post box and very nearly back into them,   like flying saucers they glide silently and  stand their ground , weighty but able to defy gravity and fly vertically, straight up!I appreciate having an open yard, come and go, do what you want. You are all so lovely. Quite a contrast to the  carefully cultivated/high iron fence with pointy bits on the top, neighbor's yard, to which most would aspire.From where I sit at the moment I see two squirrels, ten blue jays, a one legged gull, several crows,Big Mama, and the tip of a deer  ear.

Covid 19 not messing around.History sort of  puts things into perspective.We watched three hours - PBS last night, \"The Six Wives\" of  HenryVIII. And by \"we\" I mean ME , Dennis fell asleep- not enough action or special effects to hold his attention.   Traced relatives from that time period, 1400's , His name was Jon Hanks - pretty sure he had a wife but history is generally recorded from  patriarchal view, clearly HE was not the one who produced the babies that eventually evolved into slug on the couch.Anyway the three hour program was  presented from the perspective of  women - more historically factual.  Devastating for the women folk back then, my god- the patriarchy so wicked. The male narrative throughout  HIStory, misses so much .(slug on the couch)This is the quarrelsome  younger, smaller woman raccoon.Soaking wet in her fur coat,  stares through the dirty window,  the oversized Cost co peanut bag looks enticing, word is out... Yes, we give her a handful...and then another...  Dennis washes her water dish ,tells her she is a good girl...\"DO NOT FEED\" Yes, we know...arrest us.Is that a face you could ignore? nope.

This one, I suppose was one of the worst, thus its unfinished business. I  painted  cards, sold them for a dollar .

{"title": "pigeon blood, raccoon tummy and a cake explosion", "date": "Sunday, June 28, 2020", "text": "When My friend gave his house to the university, there were many things left behind. These vases had always been on the mantle from when his parents went to Japan in 1930 or so. There were many raucous parties in that house after his parents died- MANY! And there were people who tried to take advantage of my friend when he was unwell. Things disappeared right and left.These two vases remained, one has a slight scuff that is invisible unless one is handling it /cleaning it, otherwise, in perfect nick. I never thought much about these vases,  usually covered in dust - obscured by other stuff collected on the mantel. Plus they were \"only  Japanese\", probably a dime a dozen , right? I rarely even glanced at them thinking that they were painted on plastic...I reluctantly brought them home, not particularly enthralled with them but did not want to leave them to the university to just dump in the large blue \"Got Trash?\" truck.Yesterday I finally got them out of the box and cleaned them up. They are pigeon blood red , fish scale Ginbari foiled , bamboo leaves , a bird - clear enameled with cloisonne florals. Ginbari foil is an ancient enamel technique developed by Japanese artists. It is also the name of the thicker silver foil used to make one of a kind or repeated design motifs in silver. These designs show through your transparent enamels and add an extra layer of surface texture and pattern. You can also use it with cloisonné techniques.With these thicker foils, you can create repeating sophisticated motifs by embossing it. You can create one of a kind designs in the foil to compliment your enamels. And you can push the height of the embossed lines in the foil to even use it to create cells for cloisonné without wires.  Naturally I tried to find something similar out there in Google -library- of -everything.Dennis took a photo of it with his phone , used an ap \"Google lens\" and found the exact vase out there in the universe, quick as a wink!Just one  & had a worth point of $250.00( which , for all of the work involved and the age seems down right cheap!)Good save! And that somewhat explains why these vases were not shattered during any or all of those parties of crazy students. Enamel is strong and forgiving, the fish scale silver , also strong.  Big Mama came yesterday and got comfy with the basket between her legs, a few kibbles. I put out a bowl of water, She tried her best to get inside the bowl , decided that she may be too large, took a nap beside it with her paws dangling over the edge of the bowl in the cool water. A common myth is that raccoons wash their food but that is not true. Raccoons have highly sensitive hands/paws that are covered in protective skin, To soften them for higher sensitivity water is essential, like humans wearing glasses sort of, we see our food- they feel their food. Though it appears that they may be washing their food they are actually using a braille method to \"see\" what they are eating. The esophagus is narrow, wet food is best or tiny food, like the cat kibbles Big Mama found inthe basket. ( is that too much mansplaining?)  Going through STUFF, trying to do the \"joy\" thing...This photo popped up.A really bad photo of a spectacular cake!It was my 30th birthday- I was living with two London lads , and my boyfriend from Melbourne.We lived out in the county off the grid, My boyfriend, two cats and a dog in the cabin, the London lads in the back shed/barn. We had all lived together before in London- we were good at working and living  together.We had two wood stoves in the barn and one in the house, The lads decided to have a party for me and made 16 large  English fruit cakes, Carved them into the place where we lived beneath the mountain ( Mount Baker/volcano)The photo is so terrible , I am not even sure who took it, many people showed up- the cake was a thing of wonder- the cabin, the barn the road my pick up truck, the forests the pea field and the river, all in miniature detail. The mountain had a hole through it with a tube leading into a cup of sloe gin - for the cutting of the cake- The gin shot up through the tube and covered the mountain in \"lava\". SPECTACULAR!!It was all a surprise, I had no idea that they had been baking all day and building this thing, as well as stacking a huge bonfire in the back forty, inviting guests from town, I was working all day down the road- Huge party (I thought It would just be the usual us , small dinner - things from the garden and trout from the river. )so, yes, this really bad photo brings me joy. Not for the Kondo tip.Also one of our friends from town climbed a tree and fell off of a branch INTO the fire!SPECTACULAR!!! No worries , just a little panic and singed hair.Well done!Bringing JOY!I will never turn a spectacular 30 again!"},

Perspective.For $120.00 you can buy  a real avocado tree about two feet tall, guaranteed to produce avocados within three years-  Dug around in the trash  for a seed,  stuck it in water , as you do,  and now we have this avocado tree 3' tall.  It will never be entirely happy, I suppose, and will not bear fruit - but its life in a pot might be better than being compost. So , that was Sunday, Father's day, like any other day.I saw this tail going by my window- and thought that the blind Mama had been injured again- ( drinking out of the overturned flower pot like a pro. )but NO it is an entirely different tail of another  Mama. Oh What?She is smaller, younger  and not nearly as tattered- both of her eyes work.And she is just as comfortable sleeping on the deck for a few minutes before carrying on her Mama business. Her nips are not as full as the bigger Mama, maybe it is a first litter thing. - word is out,  our deck is the place to snooze, it is warm/breezy and one can see in all directions, up in the air- safe-- when she woke up she stretched and curled her tiny monkey  hands, like human babies do- endearing little creature.The big mama came last night, I think, not sure, because , in an unorganized state as usual, I was trying to read a non-compelling book,  trying to watch something insipid on Netflix and trying to fold laundry, all at the same time, while eating toast, saw a shadow of a creature but it could have been anybody-Yeah, these are the days!- Mamas know that we are no threat to their naps away from their babies. They are correct -  these little mother's are wearing masks and wash their hands regularly, minding their own business, so IF the raccoon police show up ,as they did fifteen years ago ,killing every raccoon in the area- I will have to point them in the general direction of the \"Don't mask my liberty\" folks.  Please toss them in the slammer,they are far more dangerous, save the raccoons!Carry on, stay well, keep your oars in the water, do the things"},

Sad to see my little shed go.The grasses are spectacular right now, lots of rain makes them happy.Several varieties  in every alley. If I wove baskets i would have a great harvest. I made a couple of baskets once up on a time- it was really difficult and made my fingers bleed, so, as cool as they turned out  to be in the end- I have determined that a couple  with blood woven in , is enough.  Baskets made in China are pretty great- thousands of years of experience so , yeah, I will go for those.Figaro is about eleven years old - a funny , neurotic little Queen's Dog- Before he allows his lead to be attached to his collar, he must  go around the kitchen table exactly three times in the same direction.He is also very serious about His territory, do not approach without first saying \"hello , Figaro, what a good boy\", That will get you close enough to give him and ear scritch- then he might growl and bark some more just to let you know!More Pacific Northwest \"art\" in the yard across from the fish. Driftwood, everyone's fave of which I have little appreciation.Another garden shed, this one with a new paint job and a graveyard of  peonies.Nearly made it to the bay, ( which is just down the street a few blocks, I am pathetic) -too blarby  and slow, I stumbled home instead, to eat more bread with butter and honey, two cups of tea.Each mouthful scolds like a preacher man - \"you will pay dearly for this gluttony and sloth.\" I am already  realizing, thank you, shut up.Dang"},

I used it in which to roast my pixie chicken .  I usually use it for dying small bits of fabric- Maybe that is from where the water recipe  dream popped up,  sort of a connection there ( if one is analyzing)Maybe I was just thirsty- I did learn something though, in one community , where every one wore blue - the best recipe was to allow water to run through sunlight  and to hold it still - frozen but not frozen, suspended in light, for five seconds mid pour. Covid nights, how are your dreams?

Maybe in the sexuality lecture I can not remember - they are all worthy lectures, more information than could  be absorbed in one sitting.Ok, did you guess the answer?Did you guess that the thing all four have in common is that each one has been used as defense in murder trials.Claiming diminished capacity because _  \"The famous Twinkie defense\" Dan White got a lesser charge and a shorter sentence for the murder of Harvey and the Mayor- The world erupted over that, I doubt it has been used since.PMS is a slippery slope , had been used in the UK a couple of times but when the defense came to the USA, no body bought it-  too many complications with PMS.The other two are obvious and are most certainly valid.So, that was a fun riddle and then he went on- and on- and on- for hours - fascinating science.

Talked with him yesterday. Portland, a white supremacists  mess with a Proud Boy Mayor , the KKK living all around and in  the city. The police made up of White supremacists , of course.  The youngin's out nearly every day protesting, getting gassed and flash bombed. They know what is right -  appalled - now is the time to change all of that , finally,   (watch 13th on netflix for some  small cohesive measure) thinking that they may be able to change this human plague.Anyway , he said to set aside some bail money, they will not stop hitting the streets and petitioning.Unfortunately the Boogaloos have establish a uniform for themselves- including Hawaiian shirts , so there goes Erik's wardrobe out the window.Dang, he loves this shirt, especially. Steve's blog today re: a book called \"theItalian Boy\" sent me on a google search,  reviews of the book and the Victorian Dicken's era of horror but more pertinent - the history of police, the creation of a band of bullies employed by  rich Victorians to remove orphans and the poor from the streets where the rich wanted to walk without  having to bother with  the ragged- thus began  killing of the innocent,  jailing of the poor where jail rats helped themselves to live meals. Yummy orphan toes!Police have never been to \"Serve and Protect\" anyone but the rich and have always been a band of bullies.On Quora the question was asked \"What type of person becomes a cop\" The answer from a former cop -Here are some common types I've seen:The adrenaline junkie: he lives for excitement. This is the person more likely to try for SWAT, narcotics, undercover assignments, etc., because it feeds his need for constant stimulation. These guys can grow disaffected when they have to endure the inevitable periods of being a patrol grunt, answering calls and taking reports (although patrol can be an exciting job, too). In the high-profile assignments, they tend to be overeager and impatient. All of those jobs involve a lot of waiting around, and often standing down without doing anything because the situation was resolved without the excitement.The bully: he likes to have power over people. These folks lack empathy. They make life difficult for other cops because they'll take every opportunity to mess with someone just because they can. These guys often get into management, where they pull the same game on subordinate cops. Few people like them at any level.The inferiority complex: he's wanted to be important all his life, but couldn't get there on his own merits. Now he gets a badge and people have to respect him (or so he thinks). These guys are blowhards, trying to talk tough and having little to back it up with. Unless they get off the street quickly (again, often going into management), they get hurt or have to bailed out frequently, because they'll bite off more than they can chew. They are also the butt of endless pranks laid by their co-workers. Their lives are generally pretty miserable.The Boy Scout: altruistic, thinks he can help everyone and wants to. These guys can make great cops if they can survive the culture shock that comes when they realize that some people hate them for no particular reason other than they're cops. They hate being lied to, and they get lied to constantly, on the street and in the police station. They believe the police department should be a meritocracy, which it very seldom is. Burnout is very common here.That last category takes in more than all the others combined, although the working personality can change over time as disillusionment sets in. They're the cops you most want to recruit and retain, but they often get chewed up and spit out by the other types. As they said in The Pirates of Penzance, \"a policeman's lot is not a happy lot.\"Stella's idea of putting a vase inside of the felted vessel is fab! The vase is a homely one from the dollar store so the felted thing helps a lot. Making flax seed bread today- I have a brick of yeast from the bakery because all of the packaged yeast was gone due to Covid19, I did not know how to measure just how much to use so I cut off a hunk- it is now flowing all  over the counter like  the THING that ate the city.  This is the \"before\" photo when it was reasonable.  the tiger ball is a stress ball, Stress ball and gin- getting  through this day, Am listening to the French station, no idea what they are singing/saying , could be anything -more pleasant because i do not understand. Occasionally  an English phrase is thrown in - jolting!Stay well, Covid19 not going away as you know- Do all of the safety  things and F*ck the police right out of their jobs, please.Cheers!PS, the raccoon is a MOM, so...Do not feed does not apply."},

A great travel bag- just the right size. Of course production of this style has ceased , that is why I have three, knowing that if you find something perfect you just know that they will not be made again. Now, though, all three look pretty ratty, and if you went out with me you would be a little bit embarrassed- guarantee it. I just have to include this startling green of the rhododendron  young leaves,  below , the lavender taking over under the deck.They do love the rain.

And for that, there is no other way than to maintain a beautiful, happy, and bright vibration. This has nothing to do with alienation.This is a resistance strategy. In shamanism, there is a rite of passage called the quest for vision. You spend a few days alone in the forest, without water, without food, without protection. When you cross this portal, you get a new vision of the world, because you have faced your fears, your difficulties.This is what is asked of you:Allow yourself to take advantage of this time to perform your vision-seeking rituals. What world do you want to build for you? For now, this is what you can do -- serenity in the storm. Calm down, pray every day. Establish a routine to meet the sacred eveGood things emanate; what you emanate now rtant thing. And sing, dance, resist through art, joy, faith, and love.\""},
{"title": "under the porch, in the grass, peonies and jail", "date": "Thursday, June 4, 2020", "text": "Mother Doe still trusts our house enough to leave her baby here all day, This time under the porch, still as a rock.  My new zoom lens does not disturb the fawn - I am way over there on the other side of the drive  taking this  sideways photo. The Doe comes to get her child around dusk and off they go to my friend's garden where the baby romps wildly.My friend took a video of its pop corn antics and posted it on facebook. Just cuter than anything- the Mother ,   disinterested,  continues to eat apples and bulbs while the baby loses its tiny little mind boinging around, jumping, running  all cockeyed  licketty  split. Looks like it has a hundred and fifty legs going everywhere all at once.I can see the video but since I am in facebook jail again I can not share or comment. I was chatting with my nephew whose husband has a measure of melanin, of course we were making comments about the horror of this day- I said \"Yeah, honey, white people suck\" and that was enough to get the boot and land in the facebook slammer for three days.REALLY? But ,   having been neck jail for so long -  &  being in Covid19 lock down since mid February,  habits have been altered/broken by \"No choice in the matter\". Doubt if I would willingly restrict myself, being a creature of habit and instant gratification. So, the universe just has to snap me out of my own \"bad for  me\" ways. Be grateful I say!I did order the thing with the 1.5\" plug from Amazon Prime , it came overnight. I usually do not use Amazon but this time I have rationalized my transgression. If I had ordered directly from the company it would have taken at least 14 days to arrive, and by then- we could all be dead. ( did you hear that Yellowstone has had six quakes in the past couple of weeks?- sure , why not, bring it!)The peonies have not opened completely, they need ants and ours have none. I cut those that were lying on the ground  and stuck them in my sprinkler bottle. It is an old bottle  from my Mom's sprinkler stash , the photo oddly looks like a tacky post card from the fifties- the evening lighting and the poor composition/faded color. As old as the bottle.Tomorrow i will start felting using the  purchase from Amazon Prime, feeling a little bit like I have let myself  and all honest boycotters down but  there is no Amazon prison that I know of.  Happy to focus on felting instead of idle chit chat with my nephew  on Zuckerberg's Cheeto loving propaganda machine.  Covid jail / facebook jail-Becoming pretty good at being locked down, locked out. This is the third time I have been reprimanded by facebook- The first was posting art that was hanging in the TATE, the second was for posting a photo of The Orange Gas's lovely wife, (nude)...fair enough, but this last one came as quite a surprise- Thank you Universe for leading me in the correct direction- away from the maddening distraction of ZUCK and back into my pile of wool.Stay well everyone, stay focused- birthing a new world will be a long painful labor, they say."},

Not much is left of the Mill , just the  bits too good to be torn down, the new road built not for us to enjoy the backside of old industry-  but for some foreign investors dream of building 5 story condos all along the waterfront. Dumb , the water front is incredibly fragile- climate change will have it's way.You can see my studio in this shot, if you know where to look. circling back around to the water-I return to the studio for one last look- You would think I could find a 1.5\" thing if i tried hard enough. My studio is not that big. I failed. It has vanished. I take a photo of my old rainbow mug because it is broken and likely will not survive the apocalypse-  I give up the search for 1.5\" thing- head back home.Good timing- it has  clouded over and threatens to rain.... again.  The green right now is so intense, it could damage your vision.

They are  double paned and ancient, from the seventies when this house was built as a spec house on wetland, which would not be allowed today. Moisture trapped in between panes of glass with microscopic grey dirt babies stuck in the moisture. I bought paper shades years ago to hide the windows, but am loving the light of the sun when it comes out, IF it comes out- I am starved for light actually. So the shades - up,  plants  happy and, BONUS- the dirty windows keep the neighbors from actually seeing into the  dirty house consistent with the windows.   Matchie Matchie.Up the street and around the corner  folks have put in a teeter totter. I have not seen one for such a long time,  safety regulations I am sure. Playgrounds have no danger left in them, lawsuits and parents have squelched all adrenaline rushes that came from screaming broken bloodied children  thrashing at the end of a 100 foot slide or swing poles jutting up from the ground- jagged edges that could quarter a heifer. Remember those? No body died that I know of. Some were hospitalized or scarred . They became the heros of the playground, they forever more got to go first. Today, not so much, everything is suitably soft.Does that sound like a complaint? Probably is- Today I am just cranky in general.Go outside, in the yard and fresh air -fix the  cranky problem-Gather lavender - bring it in - effective  usually . If  that fails-  banana ,peanut butter with honey on a crumpet & if that does not hold,  a pile of noodles with string cheese. Can't say I am not a whiz in the kitchen, can't say I am not about 100 pounds over the limit.  Anyway, i do  the things  to become less of a crank. Sort of. oh, almost forgot- close to the teeter totter house, is this wooden fish. Also something new since Rona. guess they had a stump and  enough STAY THE FUCK AT HOME time to carve a salmon.  Do I admire the craftsmanship?  Ummm-  I should, because it has been skillfully done-  probably with a chain saw , just not a fan of salmon art -on walls, in yards, on signs , posters, cars, license plates- ubiquitous. It's just a damned fish. Add half of a woman's body to it, some claws and maybe it would at least be ...interesting . So, lets tally up the moans- I have ragged out on    dirty windows,  playgrounds , children , being 100 pounds over the limit and now  a carved fish . Another bowl of noodles  STAT! I am welcoming advice regarding how to NOT be  such a bitch. ( as long as it does not include anything from the department of religion,  or lifting weights, thank you in advance). Stay safe and well, do/be whatever keeps you afloat these days, we are not out of the woods  yet, not by a long shot, and humans truly are insane out there.

I would say it is pretty adequate for a point and shoot, I was about six covid distances from them.I was just listening to our Governor's plans to  re-open. It was bombarded by troll bots- get ready for election season!  Disgusting ignorance in capital letters and hate faces- I can not even address the real hate in this land at this time, still in shock- George Floyd, my GOD!- Anyway, I may have influenced Dennis to not re-open- fingers crossed.His health is of primary concern. He still has until June 1 to decide.There is no need to take such a risk- also the new requirements/restrictions would put him in the hole so deeply that he would have to live  out the rest of his life  buried in debt. Stay well y'all, and be kind - i know that is how you roll and I love you!"},

Paintings of his vintage family photos ,  portly ladies in their aprons in the field- with additional background, like pterodactyls circling overheard or flying saucers in the clouds. Mundane objects, lawnmowers, post boxes, toaster- in the center of cardboard or whatever he grabs to paint on. I love them  all but I love this one most -  memorable time-  box!Still finding comfort in my little corner. Notice the industrial head phones- tired of hearing certain sounds? These are the bomb for  simulating deafness.Houseplants are doing OK- I feel like I could just walk by and the leaves would wither  ,  such \"low energy\", as the Orange thug would say.Dysania  (new word) in the morning for sure...afternoon nap and a snooze before bed. Still staying home- it is so weird to go out , hunting and gathering,  and my mask makes me feel like I am a patient - that something is wrong with me- like i should also walk with a limp-  not used to it at all. Not to mention the claustrophobia and heat. So I just stay home. Groceries ?  who needs them....I don't know where to put our growing -by- the -minute houseplants - the corner by the sofa is where they are -all smooshed against the window , great for getting the light that they seem to need but will not win any good housekeeping/ beautiful interiors  award.Looking around the house, which is about all the exercise or stimulation I get these days-  see these? I wish I had sake to put in these little cups , aren't they cute?  Mid century olive wood.The little eggs inside each cup came from my friend's cockatiel  - when she put Julio in the cage with her he  killed her- he had no business being shoved into the cage with her, but my friend did not think about that, was just in a hurry-anyway, wish I had some sake but will not go to the sake store today. or tomorrow or overmorrow, (new word) Stay home, I will.I am still pushing a threaded needle through wool. tedious but will make the piece stronger and add a bit of interest I think..I ordered a bunch of wool , it came, now i wonder why I did that, I have so much wool. The ordering online blues...The camera came and I sent it back the very same day, having tried it ,of course. It was a make over, quite dirty , took really bad  blurry photos and was as big as a volkswagon. Not sure if i will get a refund but i certainly do not need another broken thing hanging around making me argue with it , coax it, plead with it. I mean-I paid  a lot for you , you little POS , you MUST work , right? more ordering online blues.So, if I do not get a refund I will be cranky but fug it. These are times when there are other priorities. Like staying AliveThis little lemon is like having a baby in the house- I take it's photo daily and show everyone with pride!  Everyone being Dennis. and Julio who  cares about it as much as  he would a stone. There are a few more blossoms so fingers crossed-  fertilizer and a rusty nail in the soil which the GOOGLE said it needs. Little lemon is lucky to not have been eaten yet- I swear I eat everything that is lying around- found a lollipop  in the back of a drawer -it was the yummiest treat of the day. After four hands full of cauliflower crisps and twenty cups of tea daily , crapulence (new word)  visits me nightly.  I see my friends making amazing kitchen delights -posting them along with recipes. Little carved mung bean fruits, REALLY? Or a timpano! good lord.  whatever -  I made almond flour pancakes this morning that were OK. Good for Dennis and his amazingly restricted diet, but  I failed to post them with the recipe, they resembled a big blemish and the recipe was \"add water\"...so, guess that was a good move on my part. Hope you are all well and loving your staying at home \"opportunity\"- I am imploding."},

Found ONLY ONE in the entire universe of the web- a rebuilt camera from a company in NYC.In the meantime - I borrowed Dennis's tiny point and shoot to take on a walk around the neighborhood.The top photo is a side walk that I have walked on for 32 years and only just noticed the foot print.Here is a mystery plant struggling against the odds - This is the street above us, leading to the high rent section, where I rarely go- the vibe does not suit me and every time I have walked up there, I am viewed suspiciously. I just look like an old hippie- I scare them- I do not belong.Which reminds me- I finally blocked an old friend on facebook this morning after he posted some bullshit about Obama- Not my president you don't!!! No great loss, best to weed the garden before the election  because you just know it will be ugly- ain't nobody got time fo dat.The snow balls are coming out, they do not last  very long , like lilacs they bloom once briefly ., and then just go back to looking  unspectacular .I took loads of photos of flowers today, but , you know, who wants to see flowers when your own yard is full of them.Above is the rabbit , the final photo from the camera that I have been hauling around with me for 15 years, Rabbit /mushroom - the final straw- spazzed out, whirring, jerking - the lens going in and out like really bad cranky sex.Anyway, the little point and shoot is adequate I suppose - the screen is impossible to see, so I was not sure of what might be getting its photo taken. There are still some tight buds out there.I especially love them at this stage. Folded, new ,vibrant, fresh ,beginning- and all that hope!Social distancing still a very good thing , people staying home still a very good thing. This was the only person i saw on my walk. Taking the big boys out!Our street library is packed! The black box is a set of really good dominoes. For the most part the little library has been offering some decent books/puzzles/games.I leave everything there- I have enough to do and read and watch on HBO and Netflix.I am truly loving this stay at home thing.Looking forward to more walks in the sunshine withmy \"new\" camera -should be here by Thursday or Friday.The state is opening up a little bit, we are in phase two - the end of the month Dentists will be back in action.Nervous- Hair cutters will not...I think I might be OK with that though- untamed untidy, is just OK with me, I will not be walking on the high street where the well coifed  live. I kind of like  wild dandelion locks,  naps -and B/W agree with me. Stay well- don't rush it and don't take any  shite from the bashers. Block the bastards!!LOVE."},

This little newborn was a twin but I think its sibling did not live long. Dennis saw them in the street trying to get up and walk, all wobbly. Nature does what she does. It is difficult to not try to help especially when the babies look like they might appreciate human interference. Always tempted but never step in thinking  that humans are the boss of mother nature.  NO, heart breaking no.This morning I awoke to an odd rustling sound, I thought something had fallen on paper in the hall- I saw the lights  ( christmas lights)  at the entry way moving around on their own...It was Julio! He had escaped out of a hole in his house and who knows how long he had been out and about, playing with the lights. I scooped him up and repaired the hole with a twist tie- he is well pleased with himself and unhurt! He must have been out all night, sleeping now.This is the little Mama squirrel that lives in the tree house.I think she has babies in there. She is the one that walks sideways , has a broken front foot as you may be able to see from this photo. She is skitterish, getting a photo of her  has to be quick!I think that the lemon tree may have one fruit ! She has aborted four of them already but this one looks encouraging.It is tiny - plumping up a bit more daily.During the stay at home , which for us has been 91 days so far. Longer than most of the nation.I have only been to the grocery three times during these days. I really do believe that we can not be too cautious especially if compromised by age .We are very lucky to have a house, minimal expenses, and solar panels!I love the post office. Brilliant that we can order things online and two days later they show up! I avoid Amazon and go directly to the company- thus this magnificent box of  BLACKWING pearl  pencils.The best pencils in the universe, -Japanese Graphite in California incense cedar, they are dreamy with which to draw or write. The sales benefit arts and music in schools, so really, how can one go wrong buying a box of them?I may get around to drawing something today...but most likely , like every other day, I  will just relax- comatose (  the queen of Corona)...and eat every carb I can find, dated ( 1998) Jacobsen's Snack toast, ancient pasta, Swedish fish from Stella.I could not get flour or yeast from the coop or grocery,  the moment the truck arrives, flour and yeast are sold out!Dennis went to Cost Co last night for meds and to fix my phone- Came home with 25 pounds of organic flour and a brick of yeast! SAVED!!! He  brought home big  butter - Cost Co size -and huge packets of cheese, Italian sausage, and cream -his keto diet!Keto is keeping him alive actually , though neuropathy is beginning to occur internally, not so much in feet and hands , as one might expect with diabetes two- but in his hip and esophagus, digestive system, who knows where else-- places one would not normally think of as diabetic neuropathy. It is such a terrible disease, effects every fucking thing.He went back to work on patients who had unfinished business- and is thinking to re-open next week on a very small scale with all of the extras that the threat of Rona requires. Which is to say that he will be working for free, paying staff and lab and  overhead, just to take care of people. That is how he rolls, his practice has never been about the dollar, he sometimes breaks even.We will be driving down south tomorrow to pick up PPE's , very difficult to obtain.So it goes, I hope you are all well , staying in as much as you are able-and ignoring the Orange Thug- we do not need that insane agro at all.

I think that the more seriously dire a situation the darker the humor becomes, by the time this is over it will be pitch black ! Dennis rummaged around in his drawers , found a pickle pin and gave it to me for mother's day.Best pickle pin I have ever been given for Mother's day.Stella and her RussianPoodle came over and spent about 30 minutes talking to me from the bottom of the stairs, brought this wonderful little elf garden that she put together.The tiny paper faces are infused with flower seeds so they are supposed to sprout when watered. She is a clever girl, our Stella. We are so missing our shenanigans. I felted another vessel. It is a little over a foot tall.It took a very long time to make.I took this photo today - it is still wet. Not sure if it wants more fulling but seems to be OK. Fairly solid, able to standfirmly.So that is it, another Rona day. Feeling fine. Feeling loved-feeling itchy from felting, fibers get in my nose and eyes which is a distraction- gives me something to do other than eat and eat some more.I have about three inches of bread left from my last batch- no flour in the grocery and no yeast available- loads of people are making sourdough for that very reason. Using almond flour instead, which may be good-ish. That will be my next try, I guess, sourdough almond bread.mmmm maybe...Whileclearing out the bottom cupboard I found an ancient cake mix- which is flour - right? I think it is from 1992- it might make dandy bread, weevils for additional nutrition.I eat anything/everything - Nothing is normal."},
{"title": "Felted I dunno what", "date": "Wednesday, May 6, 2020", "text": "I felted a large stone that I found buried under the bridge and though it weighed about twenty pounds or four hundred, I brought it home to use for felting because of its perfect shape and weight for smashing the wool. Mostly because I am lazy and let the weight of the stone do its worst.It was OK before neck surgery , effortless,  two years later I can barely lift it and roll it and carry it from sink to counter only hurting myself a little bit, yes, I think it does weigh four hundred pounds.Sensible people use a blow up ball and roll over bubble wrap, deflating the ball and then there you have it a nice round even shape.The rock is more demanding and less versatile, makes a more \"organic\" shape.After felting about six layers onto the rock, adding other colors and felting them hoping that they intermingle . Scrubbing, rolling, pounding, shrinking.Fingers crossed that it comes together because , damn, it is hard , persistent work and I have no idea what I am doing.Finally got colors to adhere to one another.Soapy scrub and roll in the sink.Hot water from the kettle  shrinks it a bit tighter to the stone.Another go over with bubble wrap which pops because of the hard stone.Scissor an escape for the way too heavy , now eight hundred pound stone, felt the tips and set it out to dry.Not finished with it, I may do something else, change it's shape, add rounded tips, I don't know, I never do. My choice of wool is limited as most of it is in the studio downtown. Most of it is merino , strong, soft and less hairy.My covid bowl.And this was Covid breakfast this morningString cheese/carrot/hot dog and coffee.Not wanting to go to the grocery.Rarely do we get such clouds in our sky, Usually they are wispy or just a solid  grey blanket.These clouds are actually cute!And then it hailed.So, another day - stayin' alive. I am glad that you all are doing the right thing, Staying the fuck at home or being especially cautious, going out in a covid uniform. Dennis is supposed to open the office in a week and a half, a challenge at best. I am not supportive of this idea.Nope."},

Any other year I would have collected more, as many branches as i could get away with. But for some reason this year, in the time of RonaI am being conservative about things- narrowing it all down, whittling to a point, manageable.I luckily brought wool from the studio with me before the STAY THE FUCK AT HOME became one of the most interesting events of this old life.I am attempting to stab and felt a vessel of some sort to commemorate this splendid time.It may likely resemble a large virus in the end, I never know how these things turn out.Stabbing wool intently, comb hair? NOPE. Not today.Dennis, wearing the Laradise cap I got in Wyoming last summer. \"Laradise\" as in Laramie is paradise.  And, in the summer, it pretty much is.Hope I don't die before I can spend another summer there. Little slice O' heaven. We nap when and where we want. Just fall down  any old where, on a sofa, or a futon, or the floor, does not matter.the days meld together,  as you know, Sleep is wonderful and the RONA dreams are vivid and entertaining.I am watching \"My Brilliant Friend\" on HBO NOW. which I highly recommend, The book is fabulous -pleased to tell you that the screen adaptation is beyond fabulous!HBO NOW is cheap, I watch it on my computer. Anyway, put it at the top of your list, you will not regret it.(this  below passed out for the twentieth time in a day, on the Big Dog rug)The house plants are doing just fine. Neglected but still pumping out babies!Needs a bigger pot, poor thing. I will get to it eventually. It is hearty and patient, and I am  just so busy these days...it is demanding- being busy at nothing and the worst part is that we are getting used to it  and liking it.This Hallmarkish thing was in a shop window the other day when I actually walked more than four feet... corny, anything that begins with \"happiness Is\" has got to be the least imaginative thing ever, beside \"Keep Calm...\" I have become a bit sappy at the moment, though, and can not be trusted.... Dennis working at home, I may have posted this already.Things do not change much when days become just days and days. he is still working at home, in the same chair, so , not a lot of diff. We manage to shower and dress and make breakfast and cruise through doing insignificant stuff.No ambition for big deals, like mowing the grass or washing the deck, or finishing undone house things..The urgency and importance is just not happening.These are my great slipper shoes,I felted on top of an old pair of Haflingers that were getting tatty on top a few years ago. but , you know wool, it lasts for a very long time!My happy shoes.

They get up close to the animal that they are built to look like.  There was a tortoise, a wolf pup, a baby monkey.The filming is genius. HOWEVER, when the little monkey robot met with some aggressive \"loving\", it died- the monkey clan had a funeral for it... they expressed genuine grief for it, hugged and comforted one another, and I swear, I just lost it.The tenderness just killed me.When I slept I dreamed of dead babies, it truly hit something, Must be the staying in, and lack of persons for three months. I am so sorry about our prison system, it is cruel and so wrong.I have not heard from my prison lad for a couple of years now, I don't even know if he is alive. He moved from one to another prison so I no longer have his address. Sad. But then what isn't sad right now. This nation, my god!!On Steve's blog he shared a  photo that he had posted in a group called \" out my window - staying home\" or something like that, it is a lovely photo so I went there to see more -posted a look out my window , front and back, deer squirrel , the usual- checked out  entries. and photos. It did not take long for the posts to turn to \"looking out my window , thinking about my Dad, Mom, Husband, son...who just died from Covid19 and I can not bury them\" followed by a truck load of comments mostly \"praying\" for that grief stricken person. And then some woman posted a beautiful garter snake out her front window, and some other woman asked the administrator to please remove it because she is traumatized by snakes- good lord! Scroll on , Darlin'-Well, of course, people started posting all sorts of snakesso I am pretty sure that ophidiaophobic woman must have locked herself in her bathroom after that. But thanks to that  silly facebook event -I would not have looked up the word for fear of snakes. Now I know."},

Really it does, It makes me ill.You have already seen my Lolita mugThe two tulip mugs came from the dollar store about fifteen years ago.Dennis's sister made this blue jean mug for him in the seventies.It is amazing that we still have it.Such a good job, every stitch.I really prefer these French glass  anti  mugs-  they are the first I reach for. Not sure why, I think I like them because they look like air and they keep my hands warm.A million cups of tea a day, thank you RONA.The rabbit was made by my godmother, it has my name on the back.

Until someone hollers at me I will continue . Very quiet, peaceful.Tucked away where no body goes unless they live there.All of the gardens are well tended, nothing else to do, right?Baby greens coming up about a quarter of an inch.chopped wood as yard art?  Tree spirits? Little gods?Gate to a gardenmail box jail.mail boxes on the road.Set up like a theater, watching the onions grow.I am in pathetic physical condition, I must say. I walk the pace of a snail and my tree trunk legs can barely lift my potato feet off the ground.  SLOG on ...Terrible shape. I have become an accomplished butt sitter, one of the best- I think I can say with confidence.  Staying in has afforded me this exceptional ability. When I become weary of butt sitting I lie down on the sofa and when i am tired of that, I waddle over to the fridge to see if , by magic, something delicious has crawled in there. Acquiring skills here! It will be quite an adjustment when things change to some semblance of  normal industry.Anyway, i appreciate walks right now, especially through out neighborhood. The green just about knocks me over, so lush and bright. Lawn mowers have not been let out yet, so the grasses and wild growing yards are untamed, soft!This is my across- the -street -neighbor's sign, She always has something  generously  offered.Years ago I came home with several house plants and bulbs, which the deer ate, but that is OK. Bulbs are a lot of trouble, digging them up - wintering them in straw- in the garage- no room in there anymore. Just say no to bulbs- and to injecting bleach...or shining a flash light up your bum.The news just gets more bizarro every waking moment."},

I have wondered from where the plethora of utensils come,  now I know.Every time I pass this chimney I think it is the last...more crumbling but has not toppled . When it does I would hope that the rodents living in there get a heads up.Passing by several wood piles, though woodfire has been outlawed here, there are still many homes depending on that source .In Autumn the air is a bit thick , I like the smoke smell of  chopped trees, it comforts me.  But there is a price to pay, lungs do not like it one bit, and after a walk, clothing smells like a campfire-a craving for hot dogs and marshmallows and cowboy coffee.A guy who lives in a tiny house makes massive , happy flags, They are all over town. Beats the flapping of the american flag and is indicative of this liberal area. Color, ART and a pleasing F-U to patriotic BS.two of these bamboo chairs stranded by a tip, Tempted but, resisted . I am a fool for chairs.

I like it, though it has become a bit too successful. my camera lens had a finger smudge on it. Kind of an interesting effect.

I loved him and I loved his classes, we became the best of friends, and then.... he died.  He was not supposed to do that, It has been years and years now but I am still mad at him for dying. Saves me from despair, I guess, but I still can not read Chekhov or Tolstoy without blubbering- like the literature moves me to such heightened emotion, nope, it is not the writing , it is the memory of a loved one gone  and me having never come to terms. blah blah blah, this is everyone's story, pretty sure.We are lucky that we don't know anyone personally who has been taken out by TRUMP'S virus, we might skate through this pandemic unscathed, Of course that is our hope and hope for you as well. I am enjoying the freedom to do nothing all day everyday- it has been an interesting adjustment and one that I too readily have become accustomed. Such a slug.

Pollution has become much less, the earth has had a chance to catch her breath if only for a minute.  AND I do like being at home, with endless things to do. First I wiped every surface with Clorox, did the laundry with extra hot water, changed my sheets and cleaned the bathrooms, just to set the stage for home made shenanigans.  Something about Clorox that instills a cleanliness/godliness sort of virtue, and blank canvas.  One time I thought I would get the kitchen super clean and added ammonia...Oh yeah, that was smart...killed a few of the few brain cells that I had and ended up floating around the universe for a day and a half. I have water colors to play with and Boro  Boro stitching to do, I made another boiled orange cake to have with tea. Trying to get the recipe right. altering the almond meal and the baking powder - it still came out custardy. The low sun coming in through  the window throwing the candle holder against the wall, is not a warm sun, It is really cold today, and yesterday.

I have posted BLUE as frequently as I can on facebook page, Blue art mostly and have friended several artists  so that my \"feed\" is inspiring. Stroke of genius! Every morning when I click onto facebook, all of this lovely art shows up , balancing the horror of the moment, which ever horror  might be the flavor of the day.Because I fall into high risk category with compromised lungs, I have avoided going out where there might be virus lurking...Our oldest son works in Seattle , where the virus is having a field day- His industrial design company shut down, sent everyone home to work if they could.  It's been a good move actually. less car usage, fewer car accidents, no rush hour traffic. and , best part, get to work in a t-shirt and PJ bottoms.

No more babies for Mrs. Plum - she refuses to accept.a friend gave me this animal skin , Kulit, dragon. It is a shadow puppet from the old days in china. The process of making the puppets is not a simple procedure. Generally speaking, it involves the selection of skin from a sheep or donkey, the removal of the hair from the skin, followed by cleaning the skin with chemicals to make it thin enough to be translucent.Then the skin must be coated with tung oil, dried and then cut into the various parts of the puppet. The trunk, head and limbs are separately carved, then joined together by thread so that each part can be manipulated to simulate human movements.The leather puppets are then painted to represent different characters.During the performance, the puppets are held close to a white curtain with their shadows cast on it by a strong light from behind. Their movements guided by sticks, they play the roles in the drama accompanied by music, with the puppeteers providing the voices.---pulled from the webs info hiway.A box full of them actually but I like the dragon best. I will likely list the other puppets of ETSY. I do not need stamps or puppets- I do need to move objects out of this space. Old story, and seems to be continual, like the river flowing to the sea, like the tide coming in, and going out, coming in and going out. and so goes life."},

Hoarder's illness to be sure, Unable to discriminate. She does own quite a bit of marvelous and valuable items, art, silver flute, new million dollar sewing machine and serger...some very lovely glass work and oddities from the 1920's and 60's, everything before those years and everything after.

One friend goes , another enters.We made a date. I went to her house, we went to Edison for the tail end of the annual Chicken parade.So bloody cold, these poor chickens ,  in their fancy little wagon, pacing to get warm.We went to THE  favorite shop, Indigo Dreams. and splendid it is!!The woman who owns the shop has made everything in there. A master felter , knitter, and crochetter ( is that a word?) However just one of her little crochet animals , seven inches tall, will set you back $125.00.Her  manikins are needle felted .What I could afford- this loosely spun , hand dyed wool and a yard of Japanese indigo, went home with me.The wool is  a rich vibrant teal/periwinkle/blue/nothing in nature-ish color that my camera could not quite make sense of, so it  used it's  basic blue mode...It is an out of this world color that I had to have, even though I am so done with STUFF. haha. There are just some things that can not be left behind...I am understanding my friend a bit more.I brought lunch but we decided to go to the tavern instead , The BEST fish tacos Two for seven dollars, and a beer. Perfect.It was such a bitter cold dark wet day, we stayed in the tavern for quite a while , comfy, and chatted until our mouths were too tired to talk anymore. So much to catch up with, I think we may have covered a fraction, and must do it again  - ketchup!Edward or \"Blow\" as he was nicknamed, is Edison's most famous son.His picture hangs in the tavern, A mural of him and a quote is painted on the side of a downtown building, Downtown consisting of maybe four buildings all together.From there, having warmed up, we walked a couple of inches to three galleries, side by side, most magnificent  local art, one devoted entirely to the ship of fools and this incredibly dangerous administration...with humor, the sugar that helps the medicine go down...Now, with friend gone, all sewn up, I plan to work on my own \"hoard\", maybe list some things in the hopeless ETSY  world of corporate greed. And of course donate to the Assistance league, an honest charity.Edward R. Murrow/QuotesWe must not confuse dissent with disloyalty.

It is also true that speed can multiply the distribution of information that we know to be untrue.The obscure we see eventually.

The tree is perfectly spooky as well. People with a lot of cash buy these old things to bring back to life, but I remember in the old hippie days , these were mostly squats or rented  very cheaply or for trade. We had the run of this neighborhood so much music, pot lucks, theater, Art, Makers of things, and weed.This is the inside of the front door of the friend's house.

And she will have her marbles and dirt to keep her happy. This is a major event i must say, We have been friends for fifty years of the most amazing adventures. Difficult goodbye.

Lucy settled down after that being a \"good girl.\"She is adjusting to her new life with Stella - it is kind of a slow go, Lucy having been in circumstances not  optimal for instilling  confidence in a little nervous poodle. Anyway, Lucy has the home of her dreams now and our Stella has a baby.I rescued eight mid century Danish , Borge Mogensen chairs from the \"get rid of this stuff\" day of sorting. I love them, they have been well used and probably would do well with  new cane work.I washed them and lemon oiled them until they felt satiated, fresh and happier.Slowly replacing ordinary  furniture with danish modern a little at a time.these are the chairs that I am retiring, sending to Habitat Northwest,  where the prices are good for struggling folks trying to furniture their abodes.The chairs have been through kids and dogs and art projects and are still bright and clownish.Somebody will love them.

My friend from England had come along, as well as our friends who owned the boat so,  best honeymoon ever- probably. I got to drink gin with girlfriends and... Mr Man got to joke man jokes with  CaptainTom. We finally made it to Desolation Sound where the water is warm for some freak reason, considering that most of the  coast of northern Canada is so cold that if you fall over board you have about five minutes to live!My friend from England couldn't wait to skinny dip, like bathwater.I rowed over to the shore -  not being  allowed to swim, due to just having a blighted pregnancy and a D&C , without anesthesia, ( holy Jesus!!) we were leaving right after, so  not  enough time to recover  from whatever they might have used .  Damned primitive, even worse than being a child getting a filling- our dentist's idea of anesthesia was to have his nurse hold arms hard to the chair saying,\"don't scream\". memories that stick...benefit of being a block head Nordic person, high pain threshold. The doctor brought in the tray of what was removed, an empty . small white , transparent placenta, beautiful, like a baby mermaid's dress. She knew that I would appreciate it. ---I found  giant prawns to battle on the shore. collected oysters and mussels, Tom had caught a salmon earlier in the day, we ate well.While sailing up the Straight of Juan De Fuca, a pod of  massive Orcas swam under and around the boat. We have seen GOD!! ( i mean .of course, if there was such a thing) And this is his church!The boat , quiet , except for  the lapping of the sea and the ding ding of halyard against the mast, rocked softly and then vigorously when the whales bumped us. One  whale breached, all of them looked us directly in the eyes, for what seemed like lifetimes, we remained silent long after they departed,  and my English friend wept.Magnificent! Majestic! After a few days , our friends and the boat were continuing north, we needed to go back. The only way out was a water plane, This is our dingy full of our gear, We paddled out to meet the plane.And that was that, see what dusting leads to...a wedding, a honeymoon , and  crumby  photos of a pretty damned good time ,  best we could do with a brownie starflash."},

Little green things sprouted so I put it on the book case by my computer, and gave it a drink. It is right on top of the heater vent...one evening I happened to look up. It had grown to a monstrous size, all of a sudden, the tallest lily I have ever seen -hit the ceiling! 45 inches tall! and as big as my hand outstretched Surprising.The bird tried to land on it today, as I let him out of his bird condo. His wings have been clipped conservatively , to see if he knows how to fly, he is still a baby. Well, he does know how and his wings will be clipped more . for sure. He landed here and there, but would not get on my finger so, I cupped my  hand around him, so soft and warm, little guy, gently putting him back in his apartment, He did pout. I gave him a treat, he still pouted...then...I did some research on foods that are good for fighting cancer. The best are broccoli, beets, carrots, easy enough, I stir fried a bowl full  and arranged them like a flower in a glass bowl.  Then i made broth, which took all day. In that tall jar is an entire organic cold processed chicken, eight organic carrots, seven organic celery stalks, five inches of ginger root, organic bone broth  and three cloves of garlic. Keeping it real and simple, salt and sugar are no-no for cancer, thank you Google, you little helper!I then made gluten free macaroni with four  cheeses and cream,  some flax seed and pumpkin seed on top, good for tumor shrinkage, said Google. And delivered it all. The broth is liquid energy, soothing and healing. so fingers crossed , it does some good.You can also see how empty my gin bottle is- I blame the kids....When everyone was here for Christmas, Erik brought pots he had thrown for  one and all.He is free lancing so in between jobs he decided to go to a studio and throw mud around, good to manage the stress of not knowing where his next gig will be or IF. I would not want to be a youngster these days, and I do apologize for the state of the world to them every chance I get. I feel so responsible. Anyway, he had many and they were all very cool. I like this one best , sandy, earthy, southwestern.  The bowl behind it -he said -was an accident. I love it. Keeping the Christmas lights up, keeping  the spirit alive, until it is a rotting corpse, I am determined to stretch out this joy thing  as long as possible.the news is just too dire.  At the base of our fig tree /Christmas tree is this fused glass plate I have had for years - could never find a place for it where light would shine through and show the colors.  The base of the tree is perfect, by the window, meager light shining through. not a very good photo of it, it's colors are much better than this. This is the fifth year we have not deceived any trees  with an Ax,  to drag them in , decorate, watch die a sad needle dropping death,  tossing them out on the curb for the boy scouts to collect, after we  have had our way with it. -feel a  better about  Christmas Fig tree . knowing that no trees were murdered for our pleasure and merriment. I vaguely remember a song we sang in elementary school about a tree that bravely stood near the edge of the wood- and how it was \"chosen\" to be a family's Christmas tree. That song made me so sad. Though the little gleeful tree was chosen and its friends were jealous , just to be electrified and dolled up for a few days of mirth and unnatural heat in a house, dead as a  stick. Was it worth it, chosen one?I would have gotten a live tree and planted it but you might remember what happened to the row of Christmas trees that had grown for years, buffering our house from the neighbors, being a memorial to all Christmases past - a haven for birds and squirrels- murdered for the sake of the neighbor's view!  Geez, that was sad, and view of what? big deal, a pond of grey water. with a boat on top- I would rather have  kept the trees.  I guess the best news of the day is that Prince Harry quit the charade of royal life - so brave and cool, I love those two."},

So I kept it, uneaten, it's just  so important.Another  friend grew a lemon, just one ,hanging from a little tree like the only ornament worthy of such honor. Meanwhile I struggle to keep the avocado alive - no light, makes it difficult, so I put it under the light bulb hoping that it might be tricked.Sarah got her permit to mudlark, sent these things from the Thames  shore, the ships nail is large and wonderful.

Good idea.Last night Cubby's people called to say that they had returned . but to keep him overnight because things were complicated.I agreed to return him in the morning. Cubby had another idea, he knew somehow that his family was back. Vibes, intuition, dogs know things.So off he went to be with his family and I am sure that he comforted them as he does.Weather has taken a turn, the wind has kicked up bending everything backwards and making frightening noises.

The worst , scariest, disheartening  development that one could imagine...not sure yet what will be happening but I do know that Cubby may be here for a while.After the past year and after this Christmas I feel like-When people say \"Happy New Year\" - i am skeptical at best. I must put all of the Christmas stuff away, except for the lights, I will keep those and keep them on until the darkness quits being  so relentless. Some say that a solstice did occur.. we are headed toward lighter days.Cubby is the best medicine, the most cheerful little Muppet blur.It is too miserable outside to do much walking, he turns his nose up at the thought, standing stubbornly on the front step,  saying \"NO\".Funny pup. I am always so glad to be his other mom.He is a good boy with a bad hair cut.I did manage to take him down the street a ways, and returned with desiccated leaves stuck to my shoe and mud, of course, plenty of mud."},

I did have to sample , and that could be why the meatballs seemed to take forever to make. Besides , I am not a great cook, rather slow in kitchen activities- I am only part Swedish, so, you know , I can not as a half breed, or a partial breed , be expected to be perfect.The bouquet is pine and cedar with a few carnations thrown in , a lily and a couple of something else, anyway it smells like Christmas.Every room including the toilet are Christmassed to some degree.

An after thought was dinner rolls or bread, so , yes, I will be making those again. A crowd pleaser, loads of butter and a hand full of flour.Grandmother's recipe.It will be a full house, all families plus A couple of Grand daughters friends and their parents and siblings from the Netherlands.Long way to come for turkey! I counted sixteen to twenty blue jays in the cherry tree yesterday morning. Looked remarkable , like bright blue leaves fluttering.I finally took Julio in to the vet, about a 45 minute drive each way, freaked him out especially rattling over tracks and pot holes, He is in good shape, had his wings conservatively clipped because he needs to learn how to fly, he never had been out of his tiny cage when he lived with my stroke friend. Brought him home and switched cages to this larger one. opened the  cage doors and top to let him wander about. Put him on my shoulder , he played with my hair, and then he tried his wings. His conservative clip was not a deterrent, He is a strong flyer especially having never flown!  I was not prepared and should have blocked off the windows. He bonked, and had to recover for the rest of the day. But now we both know.He can fly!His plans are to live in the willow I think. It does look inviting at the moment, though the leaves are falling fast! The wind has been lively lately. Color being blown to the brown ground- Bring out the SAD light. Hearts have been heavy, minds have been boggled , not just seasonally but nationally, politically.

Other news is that the city has determined that natural gas in homes must be changed to electricity within the next few years...Our heat, cooking, and hot water is natural gas , I love cooking on our relatively new gas stove, and gas is  a great back up for when the power goes out, which it does do frequently. So, now ,  we must get our own generator, there will be compromises for all of us.Trying to save our very existence on the planet that  we have totally trashed.Things do change- remember when we were all about \"save the trees\", and began using plastic bags instead- narrow deadly vision to be sure! - here's another cheer for the \"hippies\", the nature naturals...carrying  hand spun, hand woven , grocery bags , along with  coffee mugs and a bowl, where ever , just in case there was  an urge to shop, get a coffee or a nosh.YAY and HOORAY-  the hippies were right!  (  above photo of squatty gull , the one that bangs on the glass every afternoon, insistently, Julio is intrigued- Squirrel chases him off.

Julio is trying to teach the crows how to survive by being cute, and saying important things like, \"pretty pretty pretty bird\", \"what are you doing\" and singing the Woody Wood Pecker song.He thinks the crows are ill educated.Tuesday was senior day at Value Village, the so called charity shop - but really it is corporate. There are things to buy for reasonable prices   - essentials- like this little Lionel train crossing- minus the bars The little guy that comes out of the shed carries a lantern and, if it worked, he would raise his arms warning  those coming upon the tracks, that there is a train coming.There was a foot sticking out of a pile of dolls, a well defined foot , a well made foot! I dug her out and found the foot attached to this Sabine Esche Sigikid doll from Germany in great shape considering ...She even has human hair. It is rare to find such a high rent dolly in the dolly pile. Of course I had to bring her home, another essential and you think I am nuts but...just look at her!! She is so well made. Such a cute and well behaved child!Always had a thing for dolls, all sorts really. Always had a thing for bucky teeth too, I think that an overbite is one of the most attractive features of a face lucky enough to have not been to the orthodontist . When I was a child I tried to stick my teeth out,  it did not work. I also had a thing for eye lashes- mine are stubby to non existent, long eye lashes  still fascinate me - how they catch the rain or snow, how they shine with sun filtered through them like an ethereal aura, spider leg shadows left on cheeks- they are just the coolest thing to have. Somebody gave me some lash serum that was supposed to make eye lashes grow, She could not use it because her lashes grew so fast and furiously that they pushed her glasses right off of her face! Promising, I thought- but after three months of using it, - nothing, still stubby little pale whiskers on bald eyes and not worth the time it took to apply the serum. Dang! That dream is dead.  I did find this dolly, the only one I have ever seen with an overbite and isn't she darling! Senior day at Value Village brought joy - so rare these days- for a total of what it could have cost to buy a couple of news papers. We all know that that would be no kind of deal- the news papers I mean.Toys, even for old folks bring some measure of happiness.As do the colors of autumn, my favorite pallet !"},

Things we find so urgent and important send us out into the worst weather!Green floss, a matter of life and death, maybe not...Came home and began to stitch, and then the big bad news on the big bad television , distracted me, I am here giving you the \"disgusted, astonished, WTF\" look, confident that you can relate. We are in this together.I am not a fan of the enormous television, though it is nice on which to watch NATURE, NOVA, Planet Earth, and micro nature. But the news of the day would be horrific enough on a two inch screen, this is just too much. It is also \"wearing jackets and three layers in the house\" weather-bare feet not an option. So, if you come over to watch MEGA MAGA on the tube, be sure to wear socks.The rain ceased for a minute - so I went downtown to the Lightcatcher gallery where-Ed Bereal exhibitNew York Times, Bellingham, white conservative small town , beige for the most part. This exhibit of Ed Bereal the liveliest , most relevant show to hit town since ...ever. Amazing artist, is our Ed. His sculptures are incredibly imaginative, significant,  skilled technique . Sorry you all could not have gone with me. You would have been moved, inspired.  Anyway, you can google his work, better than the photos that I took - and read the NYT article if interested.I will leave you with :Puppies on a tin, because - cheerful, and I am just a ray of fucking sunshine!"},

Guess we missed that season, and guess that next year , if the opportunity arises, I will have a raised garden.Anyway, so grateful for Joe's- Organic, he does all the work, so probably a good thing all around.So flavorful!! Affordable, and NO plastic bags.On the right track, local, organic, no plastic.YAY.From there I took my plums and went for a little walk through the park.This is the same park , where about fifteen years ago or so, the pipeline leaked , big hole in the underground oil pipe,  And blew up three boys playing there. Saddest thing ever, Two of the boys made it home burned beyond saving, the other was fishing and was overcome , fell into the creek and drowned-Burned the forests and the creek all the way to the bay.  The stone bridge is above the falls, there are more falls above this and are usually quite tame. Kids play on them, there are swimming holes and places where kids dive from the rocks sometimes killing themselves. That happens, a warning sign never stops them.I am so glad we do not have thrill seekers in this house!The worst Erik and his friends ever did was go to the lake and park illegally to the tune of a three hundred dollar violation!We have been so lucky.I have a live stream web cam thing from Burning man, I keep expecting to see him.This is the other bridge leading out of the park.The fence along the roadway.I am not sure who the artist is , but think it is Reis Neimi.Major project paid for by the city- us actually,taxes you know.No complaints there should be art everywhere.We should live in ART.From there I went next door to the cemetery. always a good walk. but this cemetery is so crowded with graves, it is overload and vast, getting larger every minute.I intended to go to the baby graves and look at the cute little headstones, but decided instead to go back to the car and eat all of the plums.Never made it to the babies this time..This angel is large, she is the boss of the cemetery, no body gets by her without being judged.She has her photo taken frequently.She is rather spooky, especially at night when I would take the kids, then in middle school, to look for ghosts. We never did find any...one evening when we were in the baby cemetery we heard the babies crying----pretty sure, though it could have been the coyotes that live nearby.I hate to think of dead babies crying so I am going with coyotes."},

Not sure how these little shelters are going to be heated, but I now know where to take my extra wool blankets.Of course there are rules- no drugs, no alcohol - and applications must be accepted. I can not imagine this village working if all of the homeless were considered for this sort of community. Driving down Holly street it is clear that the folks hanging outside the help center are far too compromised for this sort of village to be their reality. Mental illness rampant, no where to go.At least these baby steps are a stab at decency and love for our fellows, You realize that just like that *SNAP* you could be homeless and need a leg up.Good to know that STILL (in spite of government) there are caring folks that are willing to help."},

A great time to go to the desert.I bought more cherries, amazed that they are still really good this late in the summer- weird weather I guess.These are huge , juicy, sweet, tender.always going through boxes of STUFF! Sometimes I find something that endears me, This \"action figure\" couple for instance.Not sure what it is that tickles me about them, maybe Grampa's pants worn spot and his Archie Bunker style, Looks like my Dad. His hep wife in her snappy outfit, matching shoes, tolerant smile on her face, I imagine she is apologizing for him constantly.Remember PANTS? and the delivery of his carcass to the deck by the door where I could not possibly overlook  it. I have wondered how it got up there, mystery solved. There is a crow that travels with the one legged sea gull - I feed them daily,   lovely gull,  polite , injured, hopping one legged losing balance- they are best friends and sometimes the gull shares with the crow- but mostly the crow waits in the plum tree beside the gull to make sure it gets enough to eat- they fly off together. Crow scouts for the gull.Crow has been dropping off little \"gifts\" , weird little  plastic bits, a stick, an odd painted pebble, It watched for a long time- as Pants came and went, it heard me talking to Pants in encouraging  tones.Crows are intuitive , clever creatures.Brought Pants back to me.Gosh, Thank you, Crow, nice...there is no other explanation.Going out today in the beautiful , perfect summer to get more fish for the gull, and to the Assistance League because it is old lady day . WHY? because everything is a dollar and they have the most amazing wonderful inventory. Last week I bought a white  Icelandic wool blanket, in new condition-  warmest, softest, comfort ever.

I think the later is the best idea. Depression seems to be the flavor of the day, living  in these incredibly interesting, horrifying days. \" throw me in the shallow end!\" please!  I was given a tooth macaroon filled with coffee mousse from Mr. Man's Hygienist - it was hygienist appreciation day at the office so there were enough to bring one home. Delish and delightful, gives one a happy reason to hang out with a dentist. Walking down by the bay This \"JOY\" was on the sidewalk. It was a \"sign\"My friend had  just died, Her name was Joy.She was my neighbor out on the rez. Tall Swedish, long braid coiled into a bun. She always offered tea in one of her many and varied tea cups, Always had some wonderful fruit cobbler still warm from the oven with cream...Her ideas were solid, her advice sincere, her guidance - somewhat adventurous and somewhat mischievous. We spent a lot of time together , out there, on the beach, gardening, nude sunbathing and talking about how utterly impossible man can be. I drove out , to check on the cabin  and to collect the pots of flowers I had taken out...and to say thank you, to what ever spirit might linger there.She sold her house next  to our cabin, she had become too old to live on her own out there, but I thought there might be some of her left over. she had moved inland, to the mountains, her heart place.I was wrong, There was nothing of Joy left at the house, so I went to the native cemetery.That felt just right.The graves are organic, in that they change always,  well looked after and  personalized, the spirits, so they say, have not entirely vanished into the cosmic soup. They come and go.This grave is one I have not seen before , \" Over the hill crossing\" says the sign.And this one with a backward leaning Mary- was not there the last time I visited.Odd, fresh graves all same family, in a row, side by side like they are holding hands.  The Butterfly bush doing it's ghosty lavender blur, the trees in the middle obscured a bit by blur .Probably the way the sun was shining, though there is a thing about the Lummi cemetery- the spirits wander, they say, especially after 4:00 in the afternoon. It is a cemetery that you can feel- not in a spooky way, but in a presence way- A very thin veil between flesh and not flesh anymore- way.And so, that was that, terribly sad about JOY,  she was ready, though,  she gave ample notice to loved ones, she was good and ready and I must say, her timing has always been right on target. This world has a way of wearing us out, breaking our hearts as well as  other flesh bits .

Stella and I went to a nursery yesterday to get some plants for this purpose, they were lovely, all plump and healthy and bright, put them in the back of her car.With that job done, we went on to our friend 's open house for art wander.I did buy two very cheerful and colorful paintings, painted on cedar fence tops so that they are manageable in size. about 8 inch square.Then we went for lunch , then we went to the antique shop, when we got back to the car the plants had all but baked, We killed them!Went back to Stella's where we tried to revive them, re-pot them, apologize...Stella swapped out some of her geraniums for the baked one and added a bright little begonia and a couple of watering globes.This morning they have perked up considerably , Good enough for the deck at the cabin. Plus , out on the rez, they will disappear overnight, as things left outside do,  I am pretty sure. Nice try, though- the pots look OK.Color  during these times of  despair seems an indulgence ,  down in the dumps, feeling utterly helpless  and broken- hearted -\"tender age\" holding cells  at the border.  Unbelievable cruelty, this nation! I. Just. Can't...My friend painted her house black - the accents really blast the color against the black - like a scream - I love this house! She , of course , is an artist."},

A difficult life for all living that life , but I was on a lark - had an escape route, the others, not so much.My friend lived in a bus with her husband (of sorts) and her two year old daughter, Esa's older sister, and her new born baby boy. The husband -of-sorts  cleared the orchard when his friends came over with their pockets full of \"horse\". My friend brought her new born over to me to look after while she looked after the  \"friends\", making sure that no body set the orchard afire or over dosed, It was scary. shocking, to me, but as I said , I was on a lark , every adventure seemed, well- like an adventure!While I took time out to go to Morocco  for several weeks, The new born died...A few years later, my friend was pregnant again, and birthed ESA, the husband-of-sorts presumed to be the father until two years ago when DNA was readily available. No idea who ESA's sperm donor is/was, other than  a foggy memory. Anyway, out of the chaos Esa, with all of her pluck and might has conquered the worst of it.I went to her wedding celebration a few years ago in Whitstable ( after ten years of she being with her husband- two children and a business renovating houses) . I sensed that the marriage would  stifle Esa and snuff her out...correct,  it did not last, difficult but necessary divorce last year. True to form Esa took life by the balls and moved on with  vision , charm and talent and I have to hand it to her- she is an exceptional woman!I have several pieces from her, but I do not wear jewelry , I love them for their quirkiness and to remind me to put stock in creativity, strength and fierceness. I so admire  ESA!Finding her way against the odds-  so, there you go, if you care to order something cool  for those women folk on your list that are not run of the mill...Christmas will be here soon...unless tRUMP has something to say about it.

A worthy read, not a disappointing sentence in it!  Her adventure in Louisiana is jaw dropping, human dilemma  good heart stuff!She was a great playmate, I asked but no body would ever tell me where she had gone- Adults were so secretive then- Now I know- she was sent to a convent to learn how to behave and to escape her mother's beatings.The father's day bloom is still hanging on! When it is gone, which looks like soon, it will be nothing but another plant with leaves that drink from their middle rather than from the root.It will not flower again.Or will it?Do your remember the movie Pet Sematary?The first one in  the late 80's- terrifying but I likely would have done the same thing, had my son died.OH! Looks like I have! Could this be Pants? On the deck there he was in the morning- how??? Lock the doors! For fun  Erik used an app that changes your face into the opposite sex.This is me as a man- I was hoping for more facial hair...but I would have been a pretty man wouldn't I? Clearly I would have been gay.The app also changes face to be 80 years old- hilarious when he applied it to his baby photos.So it goes. I have decided to NOT go to Orcas, keep Cubby for a few more days, and just BE.I might even go to the bakery and get a cherry pie, they are so good right now, Fresh cherries!!I will eat the entire pie."},

And THAT is the true mystery!I have Cubby for a week, So good to have a little dog body clicking around on the hard floor, playing with anything fuzzy, and barking not barking - his voice is more of a  Swiss dot on soft fabric - Family has gone to California where the temperature is 110. Cubby is smarter than they.The Orcas island family summer week is coming up soon, I doubt that I will be going again. It has become too touristy, crowded,and uncomfortable and now reservations on the ferry are required!  I will see everyone  most likely for Thanksgiving when all the chicks come home.I am kind of sad about Orcas- it was good for a while, we need to find a different place but then, I am not in charge am I. AND there may be no better place as climate migration has hit the PNW noticeably. Our weather has been fantastic- but what is that I hear??? The earth's plates rubbing, rumbling down below, shaking  not quite so subtly. We have been warned since the sixties, the earth is changing, we all know what we are sitting on! So, that will occur and everyone will send thoughts and prayers and \"Oh my, what a tragedy!\"- It is just mother nature,  aborting- for very good reason.Shrug."},

The tiny blossoms of dark pink and purple inside the flower get plumper and more noticeable, the flower expands! Alien!!While in Laramie , my friend, said that she could not hang out on Saturday because she had a funeral to tend to. A funeral for a finger bone and a few other bits of a young man who died in the USS Oklahoma. Through the miracle of DNA, it was determined that he was George Hanson and had a hand full of relatives left in Laramie. Veterans on Harleys showed up in full force to pay respect, wave the flag , and share the feels for one of their own.It was a most moving ceremony actually.And though I am never too comfortable around military, this was exceptional.Anyway, there was a lot of fuss over the small box of George, the Navy Chaplain filled in the blanks telling the story of the day- December 7, 1941.I am glad we went, though My friend played it down - she was magnificent.Marilyn was my neighbor  growing up , We had an open door policy between our houses, her mom was my mom , my mom was hers. She was the best student, the best citizen, the best at everything really. After graduation from University she decided to go into seminary to become a priest.Interesting career choice- She was the boss of the Episcopal church in Laramie for years and only recently retired.Here she shows me the window dedicated to the Chinese workers in Wyoming who were treated terribly. IT is a liberal church in a liberal town, a safety zone!I had not seen Marilyn for at least fifty years, we connected right away - she feels like family and I guess she really is, since we shared our moms.Interesting to see how everyone chose paths that led them though this life. All interesting and for the most part , good! I am cool with her conviction to Christ- she is not obnoxious- she does it right! And she is cool with my atheism. It's all just as it should be."},

A very long time for anyone.Changed, of course, as we do, but the glue that held us together for such a long time still holds.Time and space has nothing on this sort of connection.She is as lovely as the Wyoming sky is wide.We live such remarkably opposite lives- She a New Yorker, monied, incredibly slender and tall and elegant.Well connected in her world of fashion, music, artists, intellectuals, and did I mention money- yes, that!I am utterly and pathetically opposite, yet we still have a bond.Pretty remarkable, and I would say, generous !I collected her from the tiny airport . We spent one day hiking around Vedauwoo , Neither of us acclimated to the elevation, we had to stop and catch our breath many times. A first for both of us to suffer altitude sickness and no matter what they say , all of the drinking of water, rest, will not help, it just takes time. Virginia is a Master Swimmer, still suffered from altitude.I drank a bathtub full of water, probably- still felt light headed, achy, dizzy, unable to breathe. By the time I left, ten days later, I was fine...Just about every one's Dads worked for the Union Pacific \"Rayroad\".Our Dads , more specifically worked on the caboose, Conductors.Virginia had not driven a car for fifty years- When Erik was eight years old I took him on this very same dirt road to let him drive- Virginia took the wheel- went 10 MPH for less than one mile . Her confidence restored.Though I did all of the driving- we covered a lot of territory! No traffic in WYO, easy to lead foot it.There has always been this stand of aspen South of our little town, where grandmother's and great grandmother's and great great grandmother's produced the best , most memorable picnics for family, for the entire town! The stand has thinned, and there is threat of road developers taking it out entirely.Walking and talking- old friends.Bill and Virginia- her first LOVE. We stayed overnight in Bill's hand built , Log house, huge by log cabin standards and about the prettiest place I have ever stayed. Babbling stream out back and an adorable dog wandering about being cool, sussing .Introduction to the house ,renewal of friendship...We drum-  rhythm becomes  trance inducing high. We meld as old friends do, comfortable , easy, in love.*sigh* relax.From there we drove to our little hometown 130 miles away which only took an hour and ten minutes because - lead foot/no traffic...It is a sad wasted little town, sucks the life right out of you - we did feel it.  We only stayed there long enough to look at our old haunts, have lunch at the best Mexican cafe in the USA, and go to the cemetery. We also went to the museum thinking that they may appreciate a painting that Virginia had done of Front street back in the day, When all of the bars and \"cat\" houses were in full swing,( most of it torn down now) She was sixteen - went down one Sunday morning to paint it. Some one called her Dad and he collected her scolding her all the way home for putting herself in danger.Anyway, the lame-assed museum person did not even know about front street,it's notoriety, it's wealth of stories, it's cowboy shoot 'em up nights, the gals with flare, had never hear of Gerry Spence , a legend around our little town for defending a murderer who murdered our friend's older sister, right there in the court house in front of her mother and her little children. He used Virginia's painting as an illustration in one of his books,  FAMOUS, right?  He even sent Virginia 500.00 smackers to use it. (years ago when $500.00 was a substantial amount)The museum person said \" Ok, We'll take it off your hands if you don't want it, I am sure we could put it someplace\"Um....no, no thank you, we'll be keeping it...Glad we went but, really, could not get out of that little town fast enough- we had sense enough to escape when we still had enough life left in us- again!"},

Her friends are all there, in that little cemetery, the prettiest little parcel of land in the town. Curious to walk around and see everyone, I told them all that they were loved and that they had been such good neighbors/friends, and to welcome my Mom to their haunting shenanigans.The top of the stump is flat enough to make a good surface for bridge playing, I should have left some cards but-I had intended to put her up here, either in Lake Marie or at our old campsite.The roads were still snowed in, the lakes frozen.There was a moose on the loose, running away from my camera. Usually they are so bold they try to kill you, I am thinking that this might have been a young one, not yet knowing that he is the boss of the woods. So , that is Mom partially taken care of, there are still more ashes in the ginger jar wanting to go on another trip sometime.Flying in to Denver and Laramie was touch and go...A storm the size of Florida hovering over Colorado and southern Wyoming made for some interesting travel. Chaos, rock and roll ride, somewhat terrifying. Next time I go I will choose another way, oh no, wait, there is no other way unless it is driving...ridiculous- it is easier to get to Europe, and quicker/less expensive.

So, this time the mountain will do. Next time I will go for longer maybe , and later in the summer.While getting the ashes out of the jar Hervaluables that I put behind them, tumbled out.When people ask \"when did your mother die\" I always say , \"Oh, not long ago...\" It has been 23 years!!! Just seems like twenty minutes ago - I was shocked to see the date, truly shocked!Anyway, My Mom was secretary to the president of the bank in town- highest wage given to a woman in Wyoming at the time, She earned every dime- She not only kept the president on track, did some of his personal biz - trained the newbies, did oversee the entire personnel , learnt and taught the new fangled computer system to everyone , worked overtime for free and always smiled , sang, and had such a cheerful outlook - it is a wonder she did not give the whole town diabetes. I swear, it was hard on me, as I wrote morose poetry in the corner of my room, dang, all the other kids have shitty moms giving them angst, why did I have to get this one!!  How can I possibly rebel...Somewhere along the line she made friends with a woman of the Shoshone tribe on the Wind River Reservation. That woman beaded this for her on elk hide backing.It is stunning, is it not?  I will be gone for about ten days, a quick trip. It takes nearly as long and complicated to fly from Seattle to Wyoming as it might to get to London, and it is more expensive! The Airbnb is also pricey, Not to mention car rental . May as well , you know , cash does not mean a thing when you are dead- Which seems not that far off.THIS is about right, Tom is always right.Off I go, to pack I don't know what...Wyoming, all four season in a bag, plus tea because Wyoming hasn't heard of good tea,Lipton's is your only choice-a sissy drink for invalids. so, I have a load of tea, Darjeeling, Earl Grey, English Breakfast and good ol'  get your heart pumping-PG tips.  Also taking camper's food for one night and one morning because the BNB is so far out and I can't rent a car until the next day.

Biscuits and gravy...grilled cheese, Umurkun healthy  heart food.It is a sweet little neighborhood , there are  bungalows, gardens, and large Victorian, working man,  housesThis humble Craftsman is either coming or going.Might be adding a basement. There is a house down the street that was purchased for a pittance and moved across town for ten grand...They built a foundation and basement under it. It took two years. They hit the jackpot, it is now worth over 1 mill- or what the market will bear, and my guess is that as real estate goes here, it is under priced. A Jay got in ...again. He refused to leave, he came with the purpose of disturbing my obsession. Nearly two thirds done with the puzzle from hell, hours spent sorting it out and feeling all smart about it- finally seeing what it was supposed to be ... moving   trance-like , rhythmically sliding the pieces together , that satisfying \"ahhhh\" when they fit together effortlessly, no hammer required.

There go the little pots on the window sill! Anything not anchored crashed!A warning ?In case of earth quake the doo- dahs on every sill and surface would become bullets for sure!And the puzzle...well, never mind.

We used to get a rush going through it not knowing if or when the train would be coming, We were idiots, and stoned, probably.

I am sure that these are safe.  I became horribly ill from eating a wild mushroom in England when I was young, Mushrooms have been spoiled for me every since, just the smell of them cooking is enough to send me running, gagging dramatically.I went downtown to get some shoes, they were sold out, that is one of the disappointing things about living in a small town.

Every now and then he would go down  and ping it with a hammer just to hear it ring.

I ran out of the color that I was using so had to improvise with some colors that I did not like but were in the same spoke of the color wheel _sort of. It may not work.

So tiny. Testing her new born to do as she was told.Good baby.She did not even twitch when I got into the van and drove off to SHOP!,  I need a hat to shield me from the ever biting sun, Found the perfect one, the last in the shop! Field and Stream Adventurer's hat, Fold able - fits- hard to find a hat that fits my tiny Child sized head. Tiny head...big brain, they say...( they don't really say that, I did, ) In defense of my tiny brain, however, I did score more A's that either Erik or Mr. Man in our genealogy report which makes me  3.4 % more intelligent than they.  DNA does not lie!I had some time to kill before taking Mr. Man to the shuttle, I roamed Macy's.The styles are not really my fave, but I am loving all of the rainbow clothes,Thinking I might go back and get the long striped sweatshirt looking frock.I like the sparkles, too. Would never wear them but I do love their mirth!Everyday would look like a party!I would love to see some man wearing this orange suit in Bellingham, the town of boring , dark, \"don't look at me\"drabness, Stella is the only person in town who dresses beautifully wearing color- not afraid of color... confidence - flair!Conservative in dress, this little town,  but extremely liberal otherwise. Interesting program on NPR a few days ago about  music/art/poetry preferred by those who tend to be conservative and those who are liberal...Mr. Man is conservative,( if you had not guessed)- preferring poems that rhyme , music with a one-two beat, non-fiction, and realism in art- just as predicted in NPR's program.  Those things are consistently  characteristic of a true conservative.  I am opposite, in all things.

I ordered another, It is my new favorite, I could have gone to Granville island to get more and made an adventure out of it, but I just did the usual lazy me...ordered online. from my comfy chair.They are mostly herbal /spice/berry/flower infusions, but there are also green and earl grey, not a disappointing packet among them.  The only problem is what to do with the little silk mesh bags after use ,  re-purpose, re-use, re-store, re-cycle ... I can not come up with an idea for these, I could make mouse underpants, I suppose, pretty sure there is a market for that. This very large quarter is a trophy, recycled, re-owned, - the game goes something like this:There are four friends, they play pin ball, winner takes the trophy, however he must carry it with him in case he meets one of the others on the street and then be challenged, they must find a pin ball machine  right then , even if the guy is on the way to the dentist, and play for the WIN. If the guy is not carrying the coin when he meets the other on the street, he must buy the other a drink. One friend is in London, one in Boston, one in Bellingham, and Erik in Portland, so the likelihood of meeting winner of trophy  on street is pretty slim let alone that he may be carrying the cumbersome trophy...One guy has had it for well over a year and he always wins because WIZARD!When Erik was here for mother's day, the trophy guy knew that they would bump into each other, so he carried, They met, They pin balled, Erik won. This may call for another trip to London...Who knows what is happening there politically (horrendous), who knows what may happen with borders and nonsense , but worth it to go and play pin ball with the friend there. Any excuse will do.Another lucky thing, while we are speaking of things and luck- this little Holmegarrd Danish modern vase, found in a box of broken , bits and bobs, each terrible dirty  thing costing thirty five cents, just to get rid of it, proceeds to go to charity.I brought it home, gave it a bath, looked it up, and the prices for these range from $45-$225.00. I also bought a ten cent Victor mug, big spender, looked it up, twenty five $, so they say... Post of THINGS, bought and sold, is just to remind myself that matter matters, re- used, re-everything- never minding \"spark joy\", sorting a pattern for mouse underpants out of  David's  tea bags , as we speak,  maybe try to turn some of it into cash, making more art is dodgy, but recycled art of things already in existence sounds  preferable, Like  my friend who uses broken plates , mosaic- and me, changing raw wool into something as useful as a wool bowl! Everyone has a use for both, right? Matter matters?"},

It is ridiculous,  getting to Wyoming from here costs more than a trip to Europe, accommodations are as pricey as London.- going anyway, after all, Wyoming  dirt is always in my heart. The forest here is so lush, ferns unfolding, green upon green, soft- I live in OPPOSITE land, There is Wyoming,  hard and harsh- and then there is  THIS.

Took her home, Dropped her off , went to pick up the meds, went back to her house, cleaned up after the cat, took lids off of the impossible to open meds , gave her pills and milk and food, By that time five hours had passed!Had to get to the post office before it closed, had to do grocery shopping, and now I am having a cup of tea that is like elixer  at this point.Loads of running around - when will  there be one stop shopping for what ails you?

Breaks and naps by the creek in tall grass- heaven.The mud flat is where Carl and his wife live most of the time.

Of course they are endangered, but then, of course at this point, we all are.Cubby \"owned\" this object, it is now his.We finally came home , he had baked chicken with sauce and string cheese, passed out on the cool floor , flattened , like  rolled out biscuit  dough.Early evening his folks collected him, Child  hydrated, antibiotics and pain meds IVed for good measure  released from hospital to get well on her own.

He may one day be king squirrel again. He took a nut from my hand and sits close by when the door is open.YAY, worm medicine! When  I take care of Cubby, he sends me a nice present, This time he sent me chocolate mice from L.A. Burdick, of Boston - Best quality chocolate around! I usually do not like white chocolate but the white mouse was my favorite, dark chocolate ganache with cinnamon and port wine enrobed in white chocolate. Oh dear god, mouse of heavenly goodness!  The dark one - ganache with freshly squeezed orange juice& milk chocolate -dark chocolate mouse is  ganache with espresso , all mice have toasted almond ears, Last time Cubby sent me  a combo box, the chocolates are small and packed with flavor so a little goes a long way, diet chocolates ,I like to call them...that is my rational. I would ,if I could, eat them all day for weight loss purposes and betterment of health.Oh, and they arrive in a wooden box ,  tied with french wired ribbon, sealed with sealing wax. Does that dog know how to shop or what??Long ago, when Mr. Man and I were just hanging out together, We took his  boys and the boat and went out regularly into the Salish Sea where they would dive and I would cook and read and daydream. They usually came back up with several Pinto Abalone, particular to the PNW entirely, they were  size of your head, we took them for granted , Now they are endangered, of course, I can understand why. They are delicious, like scallops only more tender. And their houses are another heavenly item!I appreciate the one shell that I kept, though at the time it was not so special -there were so many...Now it seems a treasure - holds soap in the bathroom. I should bring it out into the sun more often.The peacock of mollusks!I bought the blue one at the charity store the other day, it clearly is not as nice as Mr. Man's but still...only four dollars and is gorgeous. Gone are those days of mooring in a small secluded bay, sleeping on gently swaying boat, the men folk diving beneath the placid , freezing, dark water, which always somewhat terrified me. Glad we did that thing when we could.Glad we ate Abalone every dinner, when it was still OK to do so. Leaving you with Pants, navigating his way into the stash, he really is doing so much better though he may look old and decrepit, he has a strong constitution battling the mighty worm and ...there is a friend, HE/SHE follows him around and sometimes grooms him on the railing.

The card is to be planted, biodegradable with flower seeds in it for the bees.Small steps.And , though, too late by far, at least a stab at cleaning up our shit.We were on board long ago, When our hair was long and we smoked a fair amount of home grown, We all tried to out-mother Earth one another, back then,The gulls are here for keeps it seems, That is Carl and his wife. They are beautiful but , like Assange, are terrible guests! Like Assange they poop everywhere, make a lot of noise and demands, and steal nuts from Pants.This pair has moved up to the roof . They bang on the metal chimney thing which echos down through the fireplace, a bullhorn for Carl! He bangs on  the glass doors, Screams and clucks. I am smitten - such personality, damn me- I buckle every time...I chase him away with the broom, ever so gently. He knows that I am insincere..Above is a card I got from Artist friend, Cooper.Could be , according to some thought, that I have once been a sea gull, or a broken squirrel, or a mangy urban deer...Empathy can be a bit much...and may bring rats to the yard, I have also likely been a rat, I think that they are amazing animals- destructive but look who's talking, A HUMAN! The most destructive species on the planet!Anyway, onward- I ate all of the bread and pies and carrot cake there was to eat during the winter, I am a round as a tick,( I have been that too,probably), so -and I am asking you to hold me to it- I am eating celery, boiled eggs, diet food until my clothes fit loosely again.  I hope that it happens tomorrow. Pretty sure one day of starving will erase all of the bread, pies, cake and sloth of a most depressing winter.To be fair , I am  also fighting genetics...I come from large folks, survivors in evolutionary terms.Photos of Grandfathers, grandmothers and parents are  not just portly, they are Large!I could survive a famine, I reckon."},

I do not mind, I like the deer better than I like cultivation, I guess.  whites and yellows are primarily the spring force- but the hyacinth popped out day before yesterday, nearly spent already. Not long lifers.The sorry little azalea really took a hit this winter.The Rhodys also are not well.At the back of the garden , the cherry tree, taller than the house, is so full this spring that it covers nearly the entire yard. It was planted as a dwarf ornamental tree , It was already about 5 years old when we moved in, well established. And it did take off!The cherries are for the birds, if they are not aborted as soon as they have some roundness.In the back is a very nice deer bed, warmed by the afternoon sun.Today Mr. Man returned to the office, Working ten full hours a day- He is supposed to be retired, you know. having \"sold\" the practice...and don't you know that I had a very negative impression of the the guy who promised to buy the practice , at our first meeting. I said,\" I don't think this is the GUY\"...\" he gives me the creeps\".Correct, as usual...When will men ever begin to trust Women's intuition and observation skills? Not today!Anyway, back to the yard...we are moving toward Vegetable garden with deer fence, and drought resistant plants, though that may not happen just yet, There is work to do , so this season will be all about planning.I may put a few pots on the deck , out of reach of deer, for a few veg plants. Morning sun, afternoon shade, that sort of thing, around the back of the deck. Who knows, it is predicted that forest fires will fill the air with terrible smoke this summer, in which case I will have to go somewhere else.

He had a saw in the basement and some lapidary tools- cutting stone and grinding his fingernails down to nubbins gave him peace of mind. I sometimes went out with him to the dirt - just looked like dirt to me, but he could zero in on a very slight bump on the Mars like surface of the high prairie- from yards away, bring it home, work with it and VOILA! a precious stone!Back then I was too teenagery to appreciate the trips out to the big dirt, but it stuck somehow, in my soul. I am going to go back to Wyoming for a few days in a couple of months, hoping to find an old guy (my age) who knows Wyoming like breathing and heart beating to look for rocks...Just noticed that my hand is blue/grey in this photo...I better hurry, looks like I am dying, or already there.And today is the Birthday of Two sons, Erik born on Wayne's 21st birthday- We were living out on the Reservation in a cabin, I had made salmon with orange sauce, and the richest mousse, double chocolate Baileys and cream! Celebrating Wayne's 21st Birthday! THEN, whoosh- water broke and I had no idea that it would continue to flow all the way into town which was miles and miles  and towels away...BAM, into the hospital baby center, POP- there he is, so quick that I did not get to use the being- with -child -classes- breathing skills Stayed briefly as we do in this fugged up country, back to the cabin with this tiny gem of a person, Mr. Man off to the Grand Cayman's to go diving-  then for a hike down the Grand Canyon- and that was that.A bit of a challenge out on the Rez.We moved into town when Erik was 18 months old, into a house that had more room, Wise decision.The cabin was minuscule  and would not have held us for very much longer. The distance from town was too far...By the time I got to town with all of the baby gear the list for groceries, the doctor''s appointment or whatever, I would have to just turn around an go back because Baby was either poopy, too tired, crying, hungry, wet, throwy uppy, or just plain miserable riding that far.Baby won , every time.Happy Birthday."},

The gallery in Fairhaven also changed hands and has become a sort of art school, but the owner has humored us all by having the ship of fools there for the past three years, This one is  the last...the gallery is being torn down to make way for more bloody apartments! Damn.Anyway, here is a small representation of some of the art this year.Our travel pal, Wade made this \"signed by the devil himself\" bible, flashing led lights inside the book, burning hell fire!The clock is Stella's piece, \" Knock Knock , motherfucker\"Time To Go,All in all a great show, sad to see it go.Came home and watched \"Human Odyssey\" on PBS, which puts everything into a manageable perspective. If you get a chance to see it do so, it may be in libraries by now.Curious to know  from where we have come- and watching where we are going, The first species able to watch our demise, our extinction, right before our very eyes. Curious also about white folks , mutations adapting to the north, breeding and fighting with -finally replacing the Neanderthal, though we still carry their DNA. The Neanderthal were not dumb  as folks have thought, they were highly successful for over 70,000 years!The difference between them and the homo sapiens, was ART, Music, Ritual, puzzle solving in an out of the box way.  Sapien meaning \"Wise\". Guess we lost that definition. And, unfortunately for the planet , are way too successful at reproducing.As the planet changes, those who may survive will be  dark skinned, mutant white folks  will be the first to go.bu-bye!So , all of that perspective is great for dealing with this era, We are just along for the ride."},

They are talented and completely mad! We stayed in a weird but clean and comfortable hotel north of Seattle close to the freeway so we could just scoot out quickly before traffic.We got a LIFT to the Nordic museum where we spent an hour and a half cruising through our heritage- we are indeed blockheads of Nordic DNA, which just gets all sentimental and riled up  in a place such as this.We walked to the Tractor tavern from the museum, down through Ballard, the Scandinavian part of town, Shops all shut but the window displays were worthy, reindeer skins on modern light wood chairs...sleek lamps, that sort of minimalist design, Scandinavian and Japanese have that in common.In the museum, a wealth of women's daily work, just normal everyday, embroidery, painting, weaving, fish skin shoe making, Hemp boot weaving,   grinding the wheat, rye to make brod.The fish skin shoes have a lovely insert of hand  spun, woven wool. This example is very old, hundreds of years, and holding up ! Who would have guessed to use fish for shoes. well, the Finnish , of course, of all the Scandinavian countries the Finnish are most inventive and a bit off their rockers. The most interesting/ artistic .as well. Utterly mad, honest, straight forward , no time for bullshit, thank you- just get on with your business, which is yours alone...most acceptable. Just shut up and allow at least ten feet of personal space at all times.A fabulous time was had, we were in bed by 1:00 a.m. - up at the crack of dawn for breakfast  which was included- ham ,eggs, waffles, fruit, terrible coffee, enough to fuel us for the ride home, where we passed a cabin on the road, as you do...This is the Pacific Northwest.Went to a few charity shops and thrift stores along the way, bought goofy  stuff but not much...nothing over three bucks.Went to a really good Mexican cafe, the fajita burrito was enormous, full of fresh beautifully cooked vegetables, a bean or two and the freshest guacamole ever. Delish! Great salsa, also so fresh it was like eating a garden.Then back to Stella's to pick up my car, and to admire her eagle.Finally back at home, feeding Pants nuts, and worm medicine,He seems to be doing better each day, Fingers crossed for this funny little guy.He has been such a good sport. Last summer he liked to run through the front door, through the house to the deck door, He would stop for a moment to check out my digs, making sure that I was not hoarding nuts, I suppose, startling any friends that happened to be here for cups of tea - to commiserate about neck jail...and/or the Orange Thing.Difficult to take life too seriously with Pants darting about.I owe him! He did humor me when I was  in jail.Also, glad now that I did not buy a 650.00 dollar ticket to the Stones ( as if)- At least it was not Keith, thank the rock and roll gods for that!Ironic isn't it, Mick the most athletic conservative of the lot gets nailed with heart issues at the tender age of (?) not that much older than me..anyway, that was NOT great news, but all indications point to favorable out come.

It all has been whittled down to a more manageable pile, I took four of them yesterday.They are all quite large, would be expensive to frame, so I have to think about what to do with them...Might be able to find large frames in the charity/thrift stores, in the meantime I may just tack them on the walls downstairs to get a feel for where they may want to be hung.Who knows what the artistic mind of a dementia sufferer goes through.Art sort of tells a story.Trees are budding , critters scampering, sun is shining, still not warm but SUN!!My friend with the unwanted dog ...all turned out to be a blessing in disguise, Mr. Man, went to a secularist free thought meeting south of here, struck up a conversation with a woman who has a German Shepard pup needing a pal. She lives on 24 acres, four of which are securely fenced for the dogs to romp , So that is where Luna went. All well in the dog saga, whew. Luna will have a happy life.Here come the plums on the little tree that Erik got when he was nine years old. I came home with a few books as well as David's paintings. One of which is from Berkeley, where David's father taught Botany way back in the day, These study plates are exquisite. I should probably try to return them to the Botany Dept. @ Berkeley but...I really like them.  The drawings are wonderful. Also tucked a couple of Bird prints from a large book under my arm. A poetry book, a book about Alan Turing, and Oscar Wilde, a field guide to North American birds  and a couple of music books. There is still a wall of books to choose from, Just takes time and strong arms to carry them to the car.The worm medicine seems to have worked for Pants, He was behaving like a normal-ish squirrel yesterday- sat on his haunches without tipping over.. Have not seen him today, But the nuts have attracted a sea gull pair, They are super aggressive, banging on the windows and door, I can not help but love them a little...They are Pacific gulls, so pretty- and if ever there was such a thing as a smart sea gull , these are they.They are living on our roof.When they land they sound like the sky fell.These are some pretty eggs from the county."},

I put more out for the Raccoon, hoping that he would drink it, but he was more interested in nuts and corn.Pants standing up!!!He still prefers to eat upside down, this morning hanging by  one foot on the frosty rail. Skills.The friend I went to see yesterday wanted me to take her dog to the no kill shelter, about 30 miles from here add an additional 20 or so, from her house. She is suffering from depression. I told her to think about what she was asking overnight, and call me in the morning. She just called, making decisions in a poor state of mind , still wanting me to take her dog, The dog is not even two years old, is a beautiful  very large Pyrenees, smart and sweet . Loved but not trained.Anyway, I decided that my friend might rather call animal control because they are very good at getting dogs from point A to point B with little trauma.So, that is how it has been left at the moment.It is a terrible decision."},

She is huge.Her sister is also about to pop, but will likely have just two babies.On my way back, along the road is this man's house, which he has been working on for years and years- He keeps adding to it, and the wind keeps subtracting from it. On it goes. Up and up, I guess that is what one does with unleashed imagination on  a small plot of land.  The cool thing about this house is that it is made  of recycled everything. It is solid though it looks like it could topple, The city had to make sure of that after neighbors complained. They took him to court several times over the  appearance and shakiness of this house, but he persevered, and he won.Some folks just can not handle anything that is not status quo.I understand....when we painted our house last year, we looked at the beige neighborhood, and did not want to cause a ruckus- we chose...beige.So, here we go, racing into spring after the most dismal of winters! Time for Stella to get out the pool and the Spritz and sunblock. We were going to go out this evening but I was called to an emergency. The place where we would have gone was too crowded anyway - cabin fever folk out and about in droves!This town is getting too populated, not noticeable in winter , of course, when every one is huddled over hot tea, sitting on heating pads, but, man oh man, when the sun comes out!!! It is like an ant hill and all of the ants found a cache  of  Caffeine . Or Meth, whichever makes ants/people scurry out of their minds. I am reckoning \"get used to it\"...there will be plenty of global warming migration , and this , up here, is a temperate zone just right for masses to live by the sea and the mountains, without the sun burning every corpuscle. For now, anyway."},

Some are just silly.The blue bar shampoo is the best ever- as well as the bar conditioner. The bee thing at the top is body butter and supposed to  smell like a bee.

The store cat is still there, Friendly and meowy.Old signs that are cool but not for sale, in fact all of the cool stuff is not for sale anymore, just plastic doors and crap from china.  I stuck a tiny leaf and stem in dirt a few of years ago that I had clipped from a friend's plant. It took about five minutes to adapt and look at it now!The elongated leaves of the Schefflera plant liken its shape to that of an umbrella. Thus its nickname, the Umbrella Tree, makes a lot of visual sense. Originating in Taiwan and South China, the Schefflera plant can grow to be approximately 13 feet tall but averages only 1 to 6 feet in height. Popular Schefflera plant species include Schefflera amate and Schefflera arboricola. Schefflera arboricola has larger leaves than other species and is native to Australia.Perhaps the most fascinating thing about this plant is the fact that it acts as a natural air freshener and detoxifier. The leaves expectedly release oxygen, but they also absorb pollutants from the air.The combination of its attractive leaves and detoxifying powers makes the Schefflera plant a very popular indoor plant.Same with the Benjamin fig, it was a mess when I adopted it, I have cut it back twice already, It tends to get tall and not bushy but seems to like it just fine where it is now, good thing, because I can not pack it around the house anymore.Cubby went back home, the snow is melting, the days are longer, all is right with the world ( it isn't really  but , you know) I ate a loaf of bread and blew up like a pumpkin, Stella found my Great Grandmother using her dead people detective  skills. The mystery is no longer a mystery - my great great grandmother was also found - name was Mary Frances or FANNY! Love it! Like naming your boy child Dick.There have been a lot of orphans in my family's past. They carried on ,as we do ,but living was all up hill  , a survival sort of difficult, not the sort of difficult we have...which is  \"how will we get by driving just one car for a few weeks?\"  I have no idea what \"difficulty\" really is."},

He is such a mellow little thing, smaller than a cat, easy to tote. Not sure what the breeders were up to with this sort of dog...so far from REAL dog...His nose is nonexistent. His digestive system is fragile, always a problem, His eyes are large and buggy requiring drops twice a day,  he is SO tiny but big enough to own the office chair and the entire double bed where I sleep with him. He can not go to the groomer because of allergies and sensitivities, his humans  scissor his hair frequently and choppily. He wears it well.Nonetheless, he is able to manage Majesty, and dignity. He is smart and sometimes comes when called. He is able to pick up \"vibes\" keenly. He woke me up at 5 this morning , agitated. I took him out , he skirted the yard ,paused, stared for a long time at nothing.We came in, I plugged in to the computer of course because I am addicted, even at 5:00 AM, and saw  what may have alerted Cubby. He is an incredibly sensitive little being.Our favorite Feed and Seed / Pet store that has been downtown since 1901, burned to the ground! Fire started on the top floor- not sure what was up there .They had tropical fish, birds, rabbits, mice and rats, some guinea pigs and a few tortoises. Sometimes a batch of barn kittens that had been found along side the road circumventing the kill shelter...It is where we got our best cat! Anyway, This is the saddest in an already sad winter.This place was one of the only reasons we ever went downtown.Guess we can save our parking quarters now.I think that Cubby liked this store, Dexter did,It is/was dog friendly and had the best animal food /animal advice available. Sad.This morning from the back alley. Ok...but...Leaving you with the best of happiness- This is our Halina waking from surgery with her new heart!Look at those rosy cheeks!!Success."},

HAHAHA, we concur !We have been meaning to cancel The Herald for about five years now but Mr. Man really likes the  structure of walking down to get it in the morning , the usual way to start the day- and I like the obituaries. But I think that this latest dumbness is pushing a cancellation. Out the kitchen window this morning. We have more snow than the mountain, Under the foot + snow is ICE.

Plus there is the fact that this writer is not alone in his condemnation of Shiele's character of narcissist.Other than that I am eating the flax seed bread I made yesterday and getting fluffier by the second- not much else in the house besides Mr. Man's keto food.Heavy cream, cheese, pork fat, butter, you know, KETO extreme! Not a single carbohydrate is ingested.It is working wonders for him, truly! His diabetes / blood sugar is in check, no more neuropathy  that was contributing to a difficult bowel situation- It has been remarkable! So, OK, whatever it takes- I am on board- ( good thing I can make bread as I am addicted)Now they have found the  research that the sugar industry hid since the late sixties- paid lobby and reporters to go after FATS, making them out to be the villains of heart disease and cancer when all along it has been sugar! Studies prove that sugar not only feeds cancer but creates it, Sugar is a heart attack, diabetes ( goes without saying),cancer,  contributing to just about every disease , organ damage, hardening of arteries , bad skin, lack of  brain power, Which may explain the dumbing down of America somewhat...No exaggeration. Science, There are many google-able links to it now.Of course carbohydrates are sugar, fruit is sugar, everything delicious is likely to be sugar but there is way too much of it- in everything, Addictive to be sure, because we are human- mother's milk is sweet but it is also loaded with globs of fat and other nutrients of course- Fat can balance the effect of carbs, butter on bread, cheese on pasta,  Clotted cream on scones, that sort of thing.So, Mr. Man is on the right track- and I would not have believed it had I not been here to witness!

Our neighbors brought them over in full bloom last spring for a feel better thought after the broken neck ordeal.They had been left on the porch, without any attention whatsoever,  then the freeze came, and most certainly it's days were done... I noticed tiny life in that little pot - brought it in, little chubby grape hyacinths perked right up.Disposable poinsettias, always nice at Christmas time, They do not do well up here in the North so are usually composted after the holidays.

The donor was another youngin' , a nineteen year old university student , slipped on the ice. Damn and not damn.Be a donor, no matter what sort of bad shape you think you are in, something can be salvaged.Mr. Man is donating the whole shebang to University medical school, and that is awesome!Our Jody is in med school there now, doing her rotations, and has all of the admiration and respect for those who donate, The bodies are treated reverently and given a ceremony at the end of the slicing and dicing, live music and singing, words about who they were, thoughts, a moment of silence, and a decent burial in the \"garden\".

The wood floors  are totaled.Good thing  home owners will cover most of the cost this time.The flight home was splendid! Virgin Atlantic premium which is only 100 dollars more , well worth it! Pampered, well fed and entertained, I watched three pretty good movies- \"The Wife\" Glen Close is marvelous! I watched a biopic of Blaze Foley, love his lyrics- his life a mess as one would expect, whiskey soaked and dirt...my favorite was Bombshell, about Hedy Lamar, her inventions and the raw deal Goldwyn Meyer gave her... the patriarchal world, pretty much goes without saying. Anyway I recommend it. Alice Phoebe Lou sings SHE during the credits and if that isn't just the icing on the cake!I watched three episodes of Killing Eve, favorite- black comedy, pretty dark but hilarious.I sat next to an enigma- the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, also the most helpful and generous.  A talker but very  interesting- initially. When she spun off onto woo woo she lost me pretty much, though her take on  life during these times of change was curious and rather hopeful if you believe that we are spiritual beings on a mission. I made sure she heard me when I exed GOD out of the conversation- The flight was just too long for that and I could not be polite for ten hours .So, all in all, trip home was - a trip home, the usual let down.I miss London of course- may never get back again, who knows, Brexit is flushing her down  the toilet- what a mess!There is no floating device large enough to save her from drowning in her own shit.My stay there was fabulous , the ceiling did not fall down like the last time. Sarah was delightful as always-  Everything worked and that which didn't I replaced or added new stuff.I am a good renter. Lost my credit card the final few minutes of running around- left it at BOOTS.Last day better than first, wouldn't you say. Home again, jiggetty jig- in a half assed way.

I was having an adventure- an experience, and it was good.Of course I could not buy anything, I sent some things home as Christmas presents that I had found on the street- a button, a napkin, a chain with glass bells on it...but I did yearn for one thing, and that was a Carlton walking ware tea pot. In the seventies The company changed to making novelty ware so they could keep the company afloat, thus the walking ware tea sets.Even back then they were expensive. I have searched for one ever since, hoping to find one in a charity shop in London- found one (above)...but it was thirty nine pounds- and crazed, with a chip on the lid. I let it go...Every time I go back to London I look for one, every time I fail. Looked online but they are now $90.00 plus shipping.As I was getting the roast for Christmas dinner, I popped into the Assistance League charity shop  to get an ornament for a package.

Only now do I realize how very sweet she was about it- and I do laugh  at what I thought was an appropriate gift...I remember my brother had robbed my piggy bank to play Monopoly with his friends- he lost and never repaid me, so I had to think outside the box, oh yes, job well done...thought I was so clever.I also made a flat  hand stitched rabbit for her and a cow head out of an old purse, but those things did not survive , Why this did I will never know.but it is worth the warm and loving memory of  when \"t'is a gift to be simple\" was a thing, and simple I was!Enormous heads must mean  big intellect, these kids are really really smart!Gift giving - so subjective isn't it. And really, the perfume would have been long gone by now or very stale- but this THIS bit of magnificence may last longer than I do if I keep it behind  the china hutch from whence it came ...leave it for some one else to find , in another life and have a WTF moment. Anyway, Merry and Bright to you all.Cheers!I hope that you get the tea pot of your dreams!"},

Seems she has always been around , opened shops, dealt antiques, worked for charity, a musician- a sprite, a light up the darkness sort of girl, a beauty, tall, willowy, long bond hair, bright blue eyes, yes, a true head turning beauty-  fine line, mania/despair, skittering across the surface like a drop of water on a hot skillet. no help for the mentally  unwell.... not in this country - Standing in the middle of the tracks might seem rational. As I said, - Deep week.Do whatever gets you through, be it faith,  common sense, math, science, art or fancy, I advise  myself...Be  inspired, if  able, bake at 2:00 am, use  wacky  imagination to every one's benefit,  imagine a good, kind world full of  beneficial faeries or helpful  angels, or animals that  talk to you in wise baritone voices... whatever makes this life seem less serious, this grand illusion is worth the ride.  Here's a battered angel to guide you.She looks like she is guiding you to squat and contemplate.*****Speaking of- Erik sent a TUSHY for our Christmas \"the old folks\" present, we installed it last night, It is a bum squirter to save on TP-  thoughtful on two levels , environmentally friendly and bum soothing comfort. Good lad.- Peace in your heart , have a lovely Christmas, whatever that means to you.

Feeling quite secure now that I know this man  , and  the will thing is  easy to understand for when one or both of us kicks the bucket.The attorney - stalwart as a  tree, calm as a kayak on a quiet steam-  skilled at paddling through the quagmire of people's  complicated relationships -, intelligent, a straight shooter, amiable , funny - no nonsense,, non judgmental - get - the -job- done-well and effortlessly-he did not have time to waste. For real- he did not have time-We did not know, at the time,  that he was dying- and die he did. We went to his memorial service on Saturday.  No corn, no platitudes, no god stuff-We were not alone in our admiration of the man that is for sure, It was packed! Friend's told remarkable tales, humorous adventurous tales - stories of  deep caring love. This man led an exemplary life, genuinely bettering his understanding with every event, good or challenging- a little bit of Zen thrown in the mix and a strong sense of \"this is all so temporary- and it is lovely\". Nothing like a beloved, fully lived life to sort of snap one into a better perspective. To take stock...to realize that tomorrow may not be for you. It was a brilliant service! Live until you don't! We all know this , yet can not help but get bogged down or afraid of whatever it is that limits our capacity for joy and living fully.  I don't know, maybe it is just fear- unpaid bills, a toothache, a broken neck- whatever life throws at us that takes precedence . And the fact that the Rump in the white house has brought us all down- just pooped on everything and everyone, he has. BUT, you, you  have a nice day anyway- OK? I think the rump is headed for the slammer, can't happen too soon! For the first time in two years I see a glimmer of hope, glimmering from  \"witch hunt\" genius Mueller. a saint!!In the midst of  north west gloom and loss of a fine man,  a bright spot came through the post!! The best gift arrived from Sarah Wallis- Champion maker of all things, she made this Paddington - his little coat with toggles , a hood,  a hat - two little pockets for cookies , most likely. He makes me so happy , I carry him around - \" Have you met  Sarah's Paddington ?\" I ask, and then they shake paws with him and say \"how d'you do\"He is a proper bear- offers  marmalade because he is  kind and generous, but then he remembers that he has eaten all of the marmalade , yesterday, I think it was, he looks at me imploringly because he knows that I know how to shop I have thumbs... and a  purse . He is a smart , lovely bear, and Sarah is the most clever creator of things on the planet today! He really brightens up the place!You can see, we need it!

This was where I did most of my selling during the festival of lights show before Christmas every year. An invitation only event- I sold out every year- went home with a pocket full of cash! IT was good! The company superb! The house welcoming always.It was sold last year...the family  moved to the mountain side about two miles south but UP, all the way UP,  where the eagles peer in through your windows and when it is day time, the view goes all the way across the sound and the islands. The  NEW house is mostly glass - some metal just to glue it together, I reckon, astonishing in it's  artfulness. These people know how to build and curate! It is gorgeous and everything works! There is nostalgia, however...The charm seems to be  gone.Everything is dove grey, silver, white, muted tones.The vibrant color is not there anymore, even the girl's rooms are subdued, tastefully, mind you!Though the warmth  of the Christmas tree in the corner,  decorated with all of the ornaments from past times,  home made, some favorites of the children,  sort of resembles the joyful feeling we had in the purple house...The fire and hearth take up most of the center of the house so there is that,real warmthand Vinnie  the pup who does not change will always be puppy sized - begging for peanut butter, seems to be a favorite snack, I love the little puppy licks that tickle my peanut butter crumby fingers.There are the old familiar painting throughout but most of them sold at the the shifting -of -homes- sale... I did not go , I would have spent too much money, pretty sure. Plus , it made me sad.Like I am now...There are new acquisitions for the  glass house, HUGE art that covers entire walls! Some of the smaller pieces are still  there- to my delight, and yours!Guy in his underwear vacuuming a green carpet.No worries about neighbors peering in- It is like  the mountain side is owned  by these incredible folks,  Running around freely in underwear or no wear at all will not be an issue .This family has body confidence, they are that lovely! I hide my body even from myself. No glass houses for me unless it is covered with a thick tarp...Then , maybe.Thus , the BATHTUB, no curtains, like being in air- free as the birds.Anyway, it was a lovely party and Vinnie  behaved in his usual manner.Just glad to see you, wag wag- give me some peanut butter, I did,  and I may eventually love the new digs.Change is never  easy, is it."},

They are especially difficult up here in the cold darkness. They are not happy. Who could resist, though, in spite of their struggle to survive- Christmas flower of the hour- we managed to buy some.The white ones are kind of delish looking, but the drama just isn't there. A rumor spread a few years ago that this was a toxic plant, dogs and cats and small humans died after eating their leaves- that is a false claim , the truth is that the leaves are merely irritating- You see the difference?Like when the orange gas was just a NYC swindler he was irritating, now that he is (NOT) our president, he is toxic. But what is that I hear....cue  theme from JAWS.... circling , circling...Anyway, back to the nursery, to the irritating,non-toxic, flowers meant to die-tiny shopping cart with my tiny Christmas cactus in it,  Stella's boots for size comparison.I would like to have one of these tiny shopping carts, because - CUTE!There was an area devoted to these , as well. They also are not happy in this climate...but then, who is really?Not sure what these are, but there were many- maybe these are just short poinsettias.Stella boxed up a few larger ones and smaller ones  and has ideas for them, only the BEST ideas, That girl!I have had a bad idea. and that is  me going to London a few days after Christmas. Not that LONDON is a bad idea, but going in January is not the best month for weather.Also I have realized how limited I have become physically after  broken neck, surgery, macular degeneration in one eye, also due to surgery that fried my eye,  and lack of doing anything for months on end , just can not be ME,  the body  says NO -takes a toll. Everything is compromised, this trip  not be the usual run around the city all day thing this time. I am off my game!I can not carry weight either, so can only take bare essentials in a tiny carry on. I will wear my gigantic overly stuffed monster coat on the plane, and if it crashes I will be so well padded that I just may survive. I can buy things when I get there and post it  back home. January sales will be a thing- so I won't have to spend my entire savings on needs.Oh, and  to top it all off , I got a hair cut,  a dumb old lady conservative hair cut, more and more hit the floor , just a trim, I said! In the salon it looked  just OK, at home, I lack the skill, and so there it is, all chopped off and droopy in sad layers!! Hats are good.From the nursery we went to Value Village so Stella could stock up on stuff for her ETSY shop. She scored some great finds plus it was SENIOR day 30% off- She  set up Mary and Joe with their love child in a feather manger, Stella has the best ideas!We know this !Then Off to dinner at our favorite place in Fairhaven.A very good day- the Stella way!"},

Every year it is crammed full of decorations and gifts and who knows what, this year was a bit of a disappointment - nothing local, all from China of glitzy poor quality- run of the mill overpriced crap that no body needs. It is over the top - takes months to decorate, but would be nice if  more nature , local talent, local artists were represented.  Resin and badly glued ornaments from China just don't cut it as anything more than potential landfill and more plastic for the sea.I rather like this bear bench, however. If I had a cabin I would have  bought it, But I don't so I didn't.The only ornament/decoration I did like is this yowling baby.It was a prop and not for sale.Usually we find something to purchase, even if it is just a string of  shiny bits to use later on in our fabulous art work.\\\\From there we went to a couple of charity shops where Stella found some cool mid century modern glasses for her ETSY shop.And I found these guys in a bag, took their photo but not them.On to the next charity shop, a Christian charity where they play the most atrocious music  all about praising the lord.But who can complain when one comes home with this little orphan.Had to give her a home, at least for a little while.I have been unplugged from all things Brexit/tRUMP/ horror of Israel/ and Julien Assange's cat. only to get slapped with all of it this morning as I plugged back in.  Vile shenanigans.

Who, indeed.a couple of weeks ago Karen popped in to show me her new paintings.Of course, in real life they are astonishing and interesting and spark thought and conversation.At first glance I thought the Celtic cross looking one reminded me of my Dad's RR lantern in the night, signaling the engineer that all is well.But in person, it is far more than that, moving, and mysterious.This one is astonishing in person, IT glows and has the depth of the morning glory pool , so sorry these photos are not even close to the actual.Photo quality may change soon, as I get used to my new device. My Christmas/birthday present early.Mr. Man and Boi went out to Cost Co mecca...and purchased a new IPHONE for me.It is the most amazing thing I have ever owned.So, I will be trying to take better photos as soon as the weather changes.

They do not judge.Cranberries, which I cooked too long and they were kind of gross...Condiments with cute baby gherkins, salad, One son brought asparagus, one son brought mashed potatoes. Stella brought the flowers and a cranberry apple cider punch with expensive cinnamon...we are horrified at that expense!---could have bought a yaught-There were three pies and cream , but ,by then, no body cared. and there was wine, five bottles, I think was the final tally. and nob hill whiskey.One grand daughter announced her engagement- I found this old TOASTS book from  1904- so old the toasts made zero sense. but Erik gave it a shot...We all agreed, ummmm- no...The crippled broken leg deer in the yard earlier looking for apple slices which I did give to him, but then it was too noisy so he went away.He will be back I am sure, Stella left pears for him.So, On we go-to the next holiday! We will have everyone here again, if they want to chance it. One son's dog had been put to sleep the day before , and this dog is the other son's dilemma,  An Internet dog from a likely puppy mill, he has never been alright and has cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars,  I am not exaggerating. So many surgeries- close calls, medicine- his eye drops for his eye that was medically blinded due to pressure, cost three hundred dollars for two weeks, His insulin is animal insulin and costs way more than the jacked up human insulin! He has been in doggie hospital frequently . Anyway, This dog is age and disease  demented,  stares at the wall a lot, barks at nothing, does not know who anyone is nor where he is. Poor little dude- but you know how it goes...he still wags and eats and seems to not have pain,  the expense is and has been  ridiculous  for this dog. Son has pet insurance from his work so that helps a little bit. They love him a lot, as you do with dog.The holiday descriptions from the most recent New Yorker. I will be in London for New Year- watching BBC Two in what I hope is an adequate flat -and loving it."},
{"title": "Rutting season, clank and boomph in the yard", "date": "Saturday, November 17, 2018", "text": "Yesterday morning I took my coffee out on the deck , took a photo of the last clinging cherry leaves. listening to a BOOMPH sound around the back, At first I thought it was the usual Gull on the roof or a flicker pounding out LOVE messages to any other flicker who might be in the mood.There were two older buck in the back, one as you can see with a terribly broken leg , the other quite full of sass and vigor, with mating on his mind. Rubbing his antlers against the deck posts, aggressively.The crippled buck just went on about his business.The other made his way to the front yard. He just stood and watched, as a younger male tore up the Rhody bush. Decided the younger buck was not worth a fight, I guess, ambled up the drive and into the thicket of the neighbor's yard,Isn't he magnificent! Branches flying , enthusiastic antler rubbing.Already establishing his territory, and his yearling, potential harem. The young buck did his best to impress. The Rhody did not stand a chance.Yearling  Does  freaked , run away, through the back yard and over the fence.The little guy also sees what is coming and quietly backs up into the neighbors yard- disappears behind the thick undergrowth, where Mr. Magnificent had gone.There is a challenger, though!Walking head down in a menacing manner, he comes from the side of the house ,approaches slowly and CLACK!They engage!Clack clack clack clack.It is a vigorous fight, I am thinking of their headaches and  possible broken necks, but that does not happen with  rutting. The most damage to the bucks is weight loss, not a good thing  just before winter sets in.  Nature is weird.The fight lasted for  longer than I would have expected - then the challenger  broke free and ran through the back yard , smashing into the bar BQ- the other right behind him , charging and threatening across the  cherry leaves  on the ground that look like the aftermath of a wild party.At one point there were seven deer in the yard ,  the yearling \"wives\" had long gone, terrified. ducking, and scooting!  The other's placing bets, I assume.The days of peaceful resting under the tree, chewing for hours in a spot of sunshine are well and truly over. This is the end of rutting season before every deer tucks in , waiting for the thaw and  fauns. The flicker watched from the plum tree, very still for the longest time- He may have brain damage from pounding out his  dating profile against our  Chimney,  Our neighbors covered their chimney with wire mesh after the flicker made such a hole that the rain made it's way into the house.

Stella, being a water baby, has looked forward to spending hours in the pool, by the pool, eating and sleeping in the pool, drinks by the pool, swimming in the pool.The locked gate and the sign sort of set the tone...we checked the pool- Did you know that water that is 70 degrees should be approached with caution, Hypothermia is likely.This pool was 65 degrees, the most freezing pool I have ever stuck my hand into- abruptly pulling it out screaming \" FOCK that's  focking FREEZING\" !!We asked about  heating the pool and were told that the HOA did not heat the pool until November even then just a little bit...so that was out, the pool was off limits, un- usable.  False advertising on the company's part , Turnkey, if you are ever interested in using them, don't..On Sunday the stopper in the sink broke in the plugged position,  their \"24/7 attentive  staff\" did not make it over to fix it until Wednesday evening...The WIFI was sketchy, we were finally given a different code to use, which they should have told us about in the first place...So, that was the apartment- which could also use a deep cleaning, smelled like old man hair.Shots from around the neighborhood, walking such a pleasure!This house across the street- not my personal fave- but curious...what must the inside look like, how does it function? Is it for tall people part time and short people the other times?  Finally the view from my bedroom window, the morning's amazing light, the birds raucous ,  melodic, announcing the day for about three solid hours of cacophony!Beautiful noise, happy- bright- so bright , in fact, that I wore  sunglasses indoors, at night, all of the time.Mole from the PNW, blinded by the light- revved up like a deuce....I have two face book accounts, one that I use on my IPAD and my legit one- I posted several photos on my IPAD account and can not seem to get them over to blogland. You would have liked them..."},

Our own personal volcano , Mount Baker, is overdue and getting ready to blow- they say...when it does, it will be quite a mess- I may never see you again but the upside is that finally the hoard in the garage will no longer be a concern...There were at least  four large separate forests fires, sending clouds of sorry smoke into the sky and where ever the wind did blow. They covered a tremendous bit of land, from the air it looked pretty awful. This summer has been a doozy for fires, has it not?It is such a quick flight , two hours, and BOOM , there we are in the desert, under bright blue skies and glorious sunshine. Able to breathe, able to  be warm, it is good.Palm Springs is a small piece of paradise, I swear, every time I go I fall in love with it  more. Living in the dirt with rattlesnakes  feels like home. We went at just the right time for brilliant weather. Not too hot- just right.The tiny walkable downtown is such a delight. friendly,  polite , just getting on with  ideal lives where the sun does shine and the fruit on the trees is  abundant . Needless to say a bottle of gin was required - what else can one do with limes the size of a baby! So, for the next week this will be where I park myself and will  take you along. Bring your sun glasses, a pocket full of change and please remove most of  your clothing. Feel the warm dry heat - it will heal you.We pretty much unplugged for the ten days that we were there- no tRUMPishness.No political spin.Just glorious sunshine in a little bubble of liberalism and agreeable nature!see you tomorrow.I would say \"it is good to be home\" but that would be a lie."},

She is not really a dog, no resemblance  of dog in her, so far from wolf,  like a different species. She is kind of nervous, very sweet and easy to please, but has had a rough year. Her humans had to close their shop due to a best long life friend embezzling their shop away, then the human man , a Vietnam war vet, developed glioblastoma , from agent Orange.There are 14 diseases now presumed by the VA to be caused by Agent Orange exposure. ... Before they would even have a chance of receiving disability or survivor benefits, veterans and their family members must prove that the glioblastoma was “at least as likely as not” to be caused by Agent Orange exposure.May 28, 2018---And so, He died rather quickly and mercilessly, Quicker than John McCain- There are so many vets who have died from Glioblastoma but neither the VA nor the government would recognize that the cause had been agent orange. It took months for my friend to have it recognized as the cause of death, to finally get their attention. Then their daughter moved into a dorm at University, all quiet on the home front, except for JUNE, She has developed an incessant  high pitched squeak, a cry really...annoying but , you know, poor little girl has been through a lot of  changes and puzzlement's...\"where did my humans go?\"Of course I babied her as much as I could, gave her the best of whatever I could offer. She liked to watch the blue jays steal peanuts from the squirrels.She liked to be cuddled- she liked the heating pad, she had a pretty good time.Her head fits in the palm of my hand, I tried to erase all of my palm lines with some sort of eraser on my editor, just in case there is a palm reader out there, They say that your palm reveals all, and I am sure they are right-  \"not today, palm reader, not today\" My secrets are between me and this dog that is not a dog, I  have told her everything, the more I told the less she squeaked.

When Kavanaugh showed up, I took them out of the freezer and ate every single one. No regrets. I did have to get more, They are in the freezer- I hear them.  I must get a grip, eating an entire box of Petite Palmier is helping no one.I bought  sunflowers, Bright and cheerful, really all I need do is walk anywhere - the sunflowers are  abundant -I could have picked many...but I like to leave the wild ones for the wild things that depend on their seeds to get through the winter.Pumpkins are also everywhere,  also very cheerful, and silly.

I didn't even break a bone! Anyway, it is a great way to get to the little towns south of here for lunch and a look around.We managed to remedy the world's ills over our two hour lunch so y'all can sleep well tonight.What it comes down to , basically, is:*shrug*Doggy left it's bone on the bench, I would have tucked it in my bag if I still  had a dog in my life. But I don't, and that's that.The meat market now sells clothing to put on the meat.You can see that the smoke is not gone, Sort of settled in the valley.I have to use my flight that cancelled because- surgery ...Giving me only until February to use it or lose it. I booked a flight to London, for the month of January, probably the worst time to go as weather will be cranky. It is possible that son will join me if his job falls through. His best friend is going to school there now - some where near the Albert Hall- I will try to book a flat in Kennsington  , close to  the school  or in Chiswick, where his friend has a flat- sort of torn between the two areas, also not knowing for sure, if I should rent a two bedroom if he joins me, or a studio If it is  just me. London is SOOOO expensive, it is lucky to find anything affordable. I will though. I am a good searcher.  Middle son and kids are in London right now, he is a pilot - it cost them 80 bucks to get there! , The perks are for his family only, not tag along brothers and step mothers. Of course it is unfair, I say."},

I am not welcoming the change.If it were REAL change, like maybe political  and  beneficial climate changes -from orange alert to a more even tempered Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren ,  and perhaps a Tesla in the drive, I  might  feel better about \"Winter's Coming\".Folks seem more cranky, testy, misunderstood, misunderstanding ,  out of sorts this fall.Or is it just me? ( no, it is not, just thought that sounded magnanimous ) It could be the tension of politics - a country so broken yet  so full of promise- hand wringing dread, November elections hanging in the balance. People with any amount of melanin , women, non Christians, queer as folk folk- anyone not in the realm of white  Bible BS male - are in peril.Another walk around the lake yesterday with Mr. Man , he said ,\" when I watch you taking photos I think, hmmm, why are you taking pictures of trash?\"He could not see what I was seeing until I posted a few on facebook, He said he had no idea.And I guess that is the difference - how people interpret , what comes into ones focus. Like this little  green slug pupper, how cute it is, how misunderstood, as most think it is a pest and somewhat icky and are more than willing to snip it in two with shovel or scissors. Who would focus on that little bit of slime, I would.Or this plant,what ever it is, going to seed, I think is magnificent and you would too, if I had a better camera. ( still  wanting a better one, for detail and clarity- but not today) Anyway, you get my drift.Hand prints in concrete that  also go unnoticed , hidden by a nondescript post in the forest.I point them out to Mr. Man, and remind him of the hand prints left in the office concrete by our oldest boy when he was about seven. No recollection at all for the man- again, what comes into focus for some does not for all, nor should it.I  would like to chip those tiny hand prints out of the concrete at the office and keep them, but that would cause too much damage and expense to mend, too much fuss, sentimentality is not a valid focus, I suppose.At the end of our walk, the full circle around the lake, which some say is just under 3 miles and some say it is 5-  is so serene, summer time madness ceased, heat and smoke gone. Feeling better having walked a bit, having had fresh water drinking from the  public fountain, yes, we still have those, and having had a good many dog fixes along the way, we are chill.Ready to take on this new day,  or so we thought, which has been less mellow. Ex-wife misunderstanding, crying , yelling, on phone, misunderstanding. Some one not getting a New Yorker cartoon  and taking offense. Some one misunderstanding the shopping list, the meaning of this and that, Someone not meeting expectations set by another.  Fresh out of patience. Just fix the damned problem.'And stop moaning,' she says as she moans about her crumby camera ,and the grammatical error of starting a sentence with \"And\", the gas lit country  banging it's head against a wall of deceit ..so, yeah, it could be me...probably is me....yep."},

In fact, I must not be well thought of at all. Never mind, I will continue to feed the crows and watch their antics on the deck. I have had to time the feedings however, because of the gull. The gull is gorgeous , as large as a two year old child, leaving mountainous poos, bossing every body, hollering, demanding, knocking on the door. I told him to go back to the harbor.He said, \"fuck you, give me EVERYTHING you have in the fridge- oh, and by the way, fuck you\"That is just his attitude, just who he is, he can't help it.So I have had to wait past crow dinner time to bring out the entrees.   Autumn becoming obvious, this is the cherry tree, inspired by the colors ,I felted a large flower for my oldest and dearest friend, like sisters we have been since we were toddlers.I still have to sew the backing pin on , get it into a box and post it so that she can wear  it on her coat.This is the wool I blended and stabbed.The sky has cleared quite a lot, as I look over into town, it is still hazy.But so much better!  Stella and I went into town for a bite  and a chat and a plan for when we go to the desert in October.The holly hocks are still bright and optimistic.

A little boy, however, is feeding them and chasing them  at the same time, yelling \"I am getting you duckhead,\"  The ducks are confused.We carry on, past the dock where people are snoozing in the sun, past the ball field, past the swim beach, and down the path, downwind of a woman who smells like cotton candy, no, a bubble bath, no, a jungle of fragrant freesias , an entire flower shop- we want to catch up to her and ask but we don't.Man with his boat on a wheelie thing to drag it out of the water, I think about  asking if he needs help, but I don't. I reckon I'm doing well enough just to get around the lake without the possibility of injury-First walk since god broke my neck- still feeling cautious. Anyway-Thanks for coming along,  a nice little walk, I really need to walk a lot more now, of course I can feel it , I ache to move more now, it feels like there is a serrated knife down my spine starting at  where my head is attached, but legs are fine, working as they should, more stamina,So , YAY, back on my feet, bloody well time, too! I may take you to the river next, bring a firearm.

After the smoke clears then it will be OK to clean the floor.I can see across the street pretty well, but anything beyond their roof top is a blur.and in the yard. The babies have lost their spots and knock knees. I keep meaning to buy apples for them, They must be hungry, I have left the hose trickling so at least they have a cool drink.They are so used to people now, they do not move even when I get close. Their ears go back and twitch, but that is the only reaction I can get out of them.Rummaging through old papers found this , The red star points to My Great Grandpa's roll in  cowboy / Indian shenanigans.He was born and raised in Gloucester, Not sure how he made it to the States but when he arrived he and his brother hooked up with the Mormon folk and trail blazed across America to the promised land, or whatever- By the time he got to Wyoming he ditched them claiming that they were crazy as a bag full of rattlers.After coyboying for a while- took a bride from Sweden, settled down , sort of, and became Marshall .This is their shot gun house, in the dirt of the new BIG rail road town of Rawlins, Population must have been something a little  over twenty.They look well fed and comfortable . When my Dad was eight years old, Grampa  said, \" Let's go on a trip to Utah\" grabbed little Dad by the hand, boarded a train and off they went .  \" this will be fun, I sure do love my Grampa, maybe we will go fishing, hope we catch some rainbow\", When they arrived at Gramp's brothers house, they were greeted  warmly- then Grampa said, \"  Hello, brother, I have come here to die\" Scared , shocked, surprised and traumatized, little Dad stayed and Grampa true to his word, died a few days later. Dad never did tell me how he got back , pretty sure he was just loaded on the train alone , and pointed in the general direction of home. Without Grampa.Tough folks back then- living in Rawlins Wyo, was challenge enough. When their youngest boy child was fifteen, he was reaching for a coin under a RR car, the train rolled and off came his arm! All the way to the shoulder. Why did he not bleed to death? Medical aid was so primitive then. He lived to be an old man and very capable with only one arm, A great photographer, married a beauty , moved to the Washington coast. where he died not  that long ago. His remaining arm and hand became impressively  developed. His fingers ,like tree trunks, maneuvered even the most delicate tasks, threading a needle, latching a necklace, buttoning tiny buttons...Like I said, tough folks, back then.

Clever - though  not a fan of Metamorphosis  when I read it the first time,  there is something about it that  haunts...maybe it is the intrigue of not knowing for sure what Kafka had intended, or the delicious language and sentence structure...dunno.I did read Nabokov's translation, it did not satisfy. Little wonder. Kafka asked nicely that the bug not be drawn! But THESE cut outs for  paper Gregor are just  to difficult to resist, maybe that is how Nabokov felt! Kafka would be horrified,  this paper doll breaks  rules. \"DO NOT DRAW THE BUG\"I am inspired to make a Christmas Kafka Cone- pretty sure  the market will go wild , and Kafka's ghost may turn me into a dung beetle.It is a risk worth taking, I reckon, besides I think his ghost is long gone."},

In contrast to the normal pattern in birds, female Spotted Sandpipers arrive first on the breeding grounds, stake out territories, and attempt to attract males. This was the first migratory bird species in which females were found to arrive on the breeding grounds before males. And other Spotted Sandpiper patterns are also unusual to shorebirds: Females are larger than males, female chicks are at least as likely to return to the place where they hatched for their first breeding attempt as males, and breeding females are at least as site-tenacious as males.Out my bedroom window this morning, comfortable enough to rest and chew and bask in the sunshineFor a few hours.After a good long rest, he wandered into the front yard and off to the neighbor's after nibbling what he could find that was moist and tender enough.

I got fired.But not before I discovered a book on their shelf and began reading Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.I thought it would be juicy and forbidden and all about how sex worked, I was ready to learn all about it...but something quite astonishing happened instead. I discovered beautiful heart breaking literature, prose /poetry - like nothing we  ever read in school- my brain went wild, high on delicious language .It was not until later, in college,  that I researched Nabokov's life, then  the butterflies began to circle, synesthesia, a name  for my  personal \"sensory appetite\"- synesthesia. it had a name! Nabokov and his wife, too, had synesthesia, a gift especially for a writer,  I do believe it is probably more common than recognized.For instance, if I say PURSE, what number and color come to mind? What musical note do your hear?See, Not so unusual.After I got the boot from babysitting I cleaned rooms at the CLIFF - they had actually blasted  a large portion of the hill to make this cliff and put a motel there. A pricey endeavor. One would think after all the fuss to build it that the rooms might be exceptional. Nope. they were shit. BUT I did get a dollar and hour, and could wear Levis and boots to work.And this lobby of the bank building smelled like stale people , money and pockets- and creaked like the number seven.I would walk here from school, climb the stairs to the dentist office, a small room with heavy torture equipment, a nurse/receptionist/ held my  arms down against the wooden chair - the dentist did not waste time with Novocaine.His name was , no kidding, Dr. Pepper, an army dentist and  a dentist for the  men in the State prison just up the road and over a bit- where a few trees grew in spite of the horror that went on behind bars.Needless to say , Dr. Pepper was not gentle nor did he molly coddle. it was \"how old are you now- open wide, nurse -hold her down\"So that is where I was in '62, not sure why these rememberings came to mind, but there they are. Where were you in '62?

Maybe I heated it too much.Use parchment paper on both sides of the cloth after  it has been wax  soaked  and after it has melted thoroughly in the oven.Take it to the ironing board with protective towel under the parchment paper.Iron it to melt the wax more evenly. It is messy business and I am all thumbs, you may have better luck.After that FAIL, I decided to do something I know better how to do , Felted another little bouquet.The day was not a total waste.Went to the market for rainier cherries. Sweet, addictive -keeps the lav occupied.Walla Walla sweet onions are also at the market now, as sweet as  apples.This is the first year of fireworks ban  in the city. It is working great so far!We will be going to the lake later this afternoon to meet with family and eat stuff.No big deal, just another  lovely day."},

I met her , at age 26, while cherry picking in Kent,UK. We have remained close, good friends all these years. I am a pit bull when it comes to friendship- not likely to let go. I always had to have a taller stronger person set my ladder, back then they were this tall but were also wooden. Tricky, wobbly and heavy.  Cherry picking was the most lucrative of fruits to pick, probably due to the difficulty of setting the ladders and hauling them around the orchard, but also because the fruit was delicate and had to be picked rapidly , before the birds got them all. In the evening I walked through the orchard banging tea kettle lids together and yelling to frighten the birds. Lived out the back of a VW van, in the beautiful orchard-  the good life.Went to the studio to pay rent and gather more wool. Walked across the street to see how the park is coming along. The Huge Acid ball from the pulp mill has been put at the edge of the park. It has been scrubbed, the cool patina gone. eventually some artist ,who won a contest, is going to cover it with mirror tiles.My GAWD, good thing the sun is a rarity .The mirrors are bound to blind a few people.\"Can be seen from Space!\"Also left over from the pulp mill, these castle remnant holders of the pulp, nice that they were saved. They are kind of cool. They do nothing, just stand there , idle. The creek empties at the entrance to the park, just across the street from the studio. The bay gets deep fast.The geese are glad, They have a new beach, with people throwing corn to them.They prefer slugs, but...carrying a bag full of slugs  for them , not  gonna happen, anyway , they are well taken care of.This day has been cool temperature wise, 58 degrees all morning.Tomorrow it will shoot up to 70 degrees. Traffic will be cranky and people will be moaning , \"Oh GAWD, the HEAT!!!\""},

I had my eye on that screen door for years, just waiting for it to drop off...some body beat me to it. It will not be long before the entire shed collapses. The back of it is about five inches from the ground.not sure what this tree with the interesting scar is, the road to the bay is lined with them.in the field where the grass is very dead, a rabbit hides pretty well. I swear, it is too dry for the beginning of summer- by august it will be tinder- moon glow could spark a fire.I spot a glimmer in the crack of the walkway, the size of half of my little finger nail.Set it on a bolt to take it's photo.Such a pretty blue!Off goes the party ferry- the one we had taken for a sunset wine cruise when Sarah and Andy were here- to toodle around the bay while the people drink and eat bad  hors d'oeuvres I would rather be sailing, as they say.Doesn't that look pleasant?.Arriving at marine park where a  couple of  folks are bending in the  breeze. The park used to be wild and more interesting- it has been \"cleaned up\", the huge climbing blocks of concrete shifted to some where else, replaced by pea gravel  and carefully sloping incline to the bay. The enormous drift wood trees also removed, because, you know, some body might get hurt...Meh. The park has lost it's appeal, but it is so close, such a quick walk- so I go anyway.On Steve's blog a while back , he photographed some flowers in their garden, these I had never seen before- Starry night petunia- and what do you know! There they were, by the ferry landing.What an awesome flower!Coming back up the drive, this spindly  little blossom looks like it belongs in the dessert.and so goes summer thus far. Country is  in terribly shape as we wait for the other boot to drop, and the other boot and the other....History repeats , but I really , never in my wildest imagination, thoughtAmerica would come to this!Really.Really.Really.Canada better get their wall up in short order!"},

Right out of University to a job in her field- pretty wonderful for the girl.You may recall that her love, Keith, just died on a trail hiking , doing what he loved best, heart stopped at the tender age of thirty five.  Boom, lights out, just like that *snap*Emmy is doing remarkably well, in spite of  grief and rude surprise dealt by the who knows what?Her eyes are the most unusual color, and pretty much match her hair and the universe.While I stabbed more wool, we chatted. She recommended a book \"Shantaram\" by Gregory David Roberts. I googled and caught a lecture by him reviewing his book, and his wild adventure- I will order it soon and read it slowly, intense, and so well written that Emily could actually smell Bombay prison. She told me about her Ayahuasca experiences. I was nearly sold, nearly talked into it as well as getting a tattoo, until she included the terribly graphic description of \"the purge\", and the pain involved in tattoo's. Um, think I will pass on both- besides I think I have managed to get by without knowing my life's purpose, and I already have established a relationship with the ALL.I am but a crumb- a crumb of love and snark- in the vast wonderment of  star dust. We watched the baby squirrel come in and go out , with a paws full of nut, Her feather tail is just not filling out, little cutie.The Christmas poinsettia is still pumping out leaves- the most vibrant magenta. I stuck the fallen ones on the geranium that is also blooming, Both are indoor plants.Amazing that they continue to flourish.Color!Last night I watched \"Edwardian Manners\" before a repeat of Downton  Abbey, Manners- the why and when of them and the cool English reserve in opposition to the French influence. Then \"The man with the orange shirt\" on Masterpiece theater came on, so I stayed up for both episodes- getting to bed at  blurry eyed midnight...Anyway, it was better than expected, not just a gay romp, but a truly deep heart felt representation of gay life during world war 2 , moving on to the present, through the lives of one family. It is a cry, a romance, a frustration, and  at last, WHEW, a reckoning.AND David Gyasi is amazing! Hard pressed to not swoon! Oh my, if anyone ever looked at me like he looks at Steve in the film, I would become a puddle of goo. Bones would melt.The  sketch below was sent to me from a kid at my son's school, a little bonus for buying another work by him-\" Cat in a striped shirt.\"He knew that I would appreciate, that I support Sex Clowns far and wide...So that is it, another day in the life of  boring , not bored."},

Just in time for climate change as the sun will shine more , they say, and  take out the melanin challenged . I am so white I am see through, I love the sun but if I am out under it for longer than a nano second , My pasty skin blisters. No tan for this albino, ever. I carry the burden/guilt of being too damned white, having it so easy this lifetime. Never having to think about police, prejudice toward me for just being born...my white arsed life has been gravy, I know it , am shamed  but kind of grateful because I know that I am too wimpy to be any other color. So, I reckon, that the balance can not tip fast enough, White folks have been fairly terrible throughout history- no need to state the obvious, but I did anyway.This photo (below) is much like what my left eye sees. My right eye compensates pretty well and the brain sorts it out as best it can, but, if I close my right eye, my world becomes a wavy , undulating , deep sea experience.The so called doctor fried my macula during cataract removal. I felt it happening.  It was like the film burning at the movie theater back in the day.Good thing I have two eyes- and an over achieving brain - the degeneration will become worse as the years roll by,  and center vision in that eye will be gone. There is no fix, yet, though stem cell science may happen in time to save others from macular degeneration.If you live under the sun, and you are too white, wear sun glasses. Eat green stuff and ,no kidding, carrots! And always research your doctors."},

It is ridiculous , has no life what so ever. So I just scissored it to teach it a lesson...and to get it off of the back of my neck where it heats up...see the hole in my neck? That is the scar.Good, isn't it!These are Karen's favorite flowers, The rusty /orange/pink/ yellow ones. Growing by the village green. The color really does grab you by the eyes and will not let you go! So mesmerizing, such a complex pallet.Grateful for the Pansie ,breaking the spell \" move on\" it says in it's little purple voice, \"move along\"....And this is the button my friend made back in the day , I think, but so appropriate now, probably always.Reading the paper this morning- tRUMP'S supporters, his beloved base, feel more galvanized with every media slam on the RUMP. A need to defend, to protect him because the evil media has made him a victim...So, since he LOVES and must be in the limelight ALL OF THE TIME, if the media backed off entirely and focused on what is going on with congress and the shite passed under our noses behind our backs...that might be a good move. Of course MSNBC and CNN would suffer ratings I suppose, reporting real news instead of tRUMP-o- mania.I would welcome the change."},

But for the sake of cleanliness and less smoggy air, we switched to gas. It is never on, it produces no heat and it hisses. It is stupid. The fig tree was a rescue, the tallest branches have been cut so that it will sort of fit in the corner.

Our town is fairly well protected - except for  earth quake, ash, mud flow, which will send it right down into the sound. Denial is a wonderful thing.This is the path, and that is our volcano. We are sandwiched in between two volcanoes, so , once the ring of fire gets lit, we may have to run away fast.Yellowstone, on the other hand, will cover most of the States with three feet of ash and cause a volcano winter. And it is rumbling...Last year I found some thick Gesso -experimented, thinking of Yellowstone and slapped it on some wooden boards  in gooey peaks, dried, threw some paint at it and called it mud bubbles. As children my brother and I spent a lot of  summers in and near Yellowstone, before it became obscene with tourists and cars and mentally challenged people feeding marshmallows to bear from their car windows. I have not been back since, The change - too upsetting. I will keep my profound, amazing memories in tact.Our volcanoes are way overdue for a big belch. \"Overdue\" - maybe another million years,or so. Maybe next week...We know nothing.Apparently , the safest place to be on earth during earth's big shake off is the center of England, a bit north or Nottingham. Forget about moving there unless you are already an English person...The Queen will not let you.She has run out of available sons and grandsons to marry...This is another photo of the path of lava, and the volcano, Mount Baker. Mount Rainier will be most dramatic when it blows- just to the south of us in Seattle."},

The gardeners killed the ants, without ants the peonies will not bloom. We hired gardeners because we could not agree on what to do with the area and what to plant. I thought the gardeners were on the same page as me when they first came and dug weeds, used a spade and seemed organic, caring for the soil- soon I realized that they were more on a different page with their hazmat suits and toxic spray and a damned leaf blower! Anyway, They sprayed  the bugs, the weeds, the soil. But our yard \"LOOKS\" reasonable.I brought one ant over from the neighbors peonies to tickle our bud into a blossom.

Need a new car- the one I have now does OK around town but if I cross a bridge in the slightest of breezes it sways, is top heavy and rattles. Having given my trusty Subaru to a grandson for boy adventures, and given my sedan to my son, I bought a used Honda CR-V, not trustworthy!So now we are looking at buying a new car- considering hybrid , considering all electric. Electric power stations are not readily available yet - a problem. Considering safety , my favorite to look at so far is Volvo hybrid, Mr Man is looking at Tesla. Tesla sort of freaks me out- not sure if I am ready for driving a brain...which also has a tendency to catch fire, and  readily  crumples in a crash with the curb. Looks like it would high center on a shadow!I would love to not have to own a car but this land is vast and built around the automobile- so unless the queen lets me live in London I guess I am pretty much stuck, looking for a sensible ride. Suggestions?Then there is this bit of futuristic hazard. Interesting - who gets a ticket? I guess the uber company??And so, here we are, nearing the edge of the cliff, and the great fall. Inhabiting older bodies that could  certainly use a tune up ,  an oil change,rebuilt motor...rear view mirrors still pretty efficient but the windshield has become pockmarked - obfuscated by  splats and flying pebbles after years and years of rough / smooth  / bumpy , gully washed road. In a few days I will be driving Mr. Man in to the surgery center for  an eye stent  and a new lens,  I can drive in a straight line, as long as I do not need to back up, I have washed the windshield for this event- all is well and he will be pleased with new eye! He is using the best surgeon and has been preparing for days with drops and pills. He will be able to see well for the second time in his life.His vision has always been a challenge, he did not even know his vision was compromised until , while riding in the back of his Mother's car, when  as a third grade boy, he caught a glimpse of the world through her glasses as he stood close behind her.Soon after he got glasses and could see  all of the amazing things he did not know he was not seeing. Metaphor for this living experience, no? Seeing what one has been blind  to - we can not know what we do not know or see.Which takes me to our blind spots -  white Americans.We have been seeing though a small rose colored lens, for so long we believed it was real, didn't we? - thought we were good,  had some measure of fairness, generally speaking of course, our interpretations living in our bubbles seemed honorable...Astonished at what has been rumbling under the thin surface of this fragile facade,   leashed by  sensible laws , for very good reason,  holding it  in check ( right, ask anyone of color how that has worked out...) anyway it is unleashed now- terrifying from the top down - the nature of  white cruelty to conquer. (blah blah blah old news.) Brought to you by , not white, not black, but ORANGE, of all colors to ruin!We  , white folks , are  up ended, sent scrambling to bandage the  cruelty and madness, continually  bombarded with \"in coming wounded\". Surprise over -what has become our every day reality, White , unmasked!! Heartbreak upon heartbreak.  The latest thing re:ICE and children as young as two- the baby bus taking infants- the horror of this, every fucking day! This white/orange piece of shit in the oval office and his horrifying cult-  have been there the whole time, we did not see... I ,personally , must try harder to be a  person of value, do art -do not moan, help others- find the compassion I had when I was five- the usual things , you know,... not to add to the mean spirited current that is rapidly taking us downstream, loosing footing fast.I  might need a dog to remind me about the loveliness of just being alive , on this planet, for the moment, wag and lick and go for walks , never minding the dog catcher and the bully dogs in the park. Plans change sometimes for the better, I am happy to be able to drive Mr. Man to surgery and to mend my broken neck- rather than on the trip to Finland with Stella. It's OK. I just take longer to adjust to things because, stubborn and sassy and not as nice as I ought to be- not an excuse, I am just slower than most and Pollyanna rubs my fur backwards.  I reckon I only  have about fifteen years left riding around in this falling apart vehicle that keeps blowing tires , sputtering at snails pace, leaking oil ( luckily there are pads for that) ...  fifteen years is a  drop in the ocean is it not-  transmission  still pretty good and the universal joint still  in tact , so I have a bit of time to try to be more in tune with  better aspects of being a  SO white  privileged Murikan human, and the responsibility that  that bears. I have very little time to become a better human .

I appreciate the vastness of the states and freedom to roam. Politically, however, that roaming is limited.( Damned if I will wander south of Dixie, or into the inbred inland. But that is just me...and as I stated, I am not a rational person.)All this to say, Americans are anti-social in the scope of things, accustomed to space- greedy about it- So much empty space here still...Why does Wyoming, or the Dakotas not open their doors to lighten up the overload of  world wide refugee desperation???Oh, right...I forgot for one nano second...The Orange plague! Neighbors fence goes all the way around her yard, On every post a ceramic bird on a ball - each one different from the next.Being in neck jail is claustrophobic somewhat, but I prefer the restrictions , at the moment, self contained, It feels like my own personal , tiny land, where rules apply and I know them well, nobody encroaches or gets too close. Healing."},

No choice, really , as arms do come in handy. And so, Two horrendous trips the the ER, and a trip to hospital for Cervical fusion. Mr. Man proved to be the very best nurse possible in this world! 24 hours a day!!He has saved my life, what is left of it!Incredible pain, unrest, not sufficient pain management, wept and paced through three days and three nights before  the doctor could  be reached. I can not take opiates and asked for something other, finally got it. This is a few days shy of three weeks since the slicing of neck, bone graft from some unfortunate dead person, stem cells from my hip and screws to stick it all together. I swear , if I ever have to do this again, I am going to tie myself up in a hefty bag and lie on the tracks like garbage, they will never know that my head has been severed, and how thoughtful I was to put myself in a hefty bag for tidy removal!Stella, in her stellar way, brought so many delicious home cooked meals and smoothies, I want to marry her and keep her in my kitchen all the day! Needless to say I had to cancel my trip with her at the end of May , to Finland. She will go without me and I will be jealous!This surgery takes quite a long time from which to heal, the bone must grow, and I must behave.Difficult!"},

I made one for her but tossed it in the trash because it was so terribly made. Below are the usual generic roses from Mr. man, bless him.I have been out of commission for a bit. I played hard core tug of war with the studio pooch and he won. My right arm is pulled out of shape all the way from wrist to mid back and everywhere in between. Advil does not even come close to touching the discomfort. Heat is the only thing making it better. So, have not been able to do anything right handed lately.I had to go to the DOL to renew my driver's license. I thought I did it online, sent money, filled out everything they wanted. But nothing came in the post. I tried to phone them, no answer, then I got two emails from them saying that my license would be sent tomorrow ...and then another saying that my license would never come because it had expired...Bogus site! Went to the bank after the DOL, luckily got a refund and a new card.Minor hassle but monumental when my arm feels like it has polio. The thing about the tug of war is that the pooch is tiny, he has a mighty grip, like a pit bull, and is a little mass of muscle ,  I have been humbled."},

It was built above cliffs that fall directly into the sound. A narrow  twisty curvy road that is absolutely breathtaking in it's beauty - loads of car commercials shot here. Loads of lives lost here as well.I came close!Early in the morning driving home from work I totaled my car on this drive and nearly went over the edge, bounced off of the guard rail, overcompensated -slammed into the rock hillside-bounced off of the boulders and back into the guard rail, like a pin ball wizard.The road can be slippery.Below, a biker on  the trail by my friend's house a  mile south of me.usually these drift wood sculptures are high and dry in the artists yard. He commented that , good to use wood!Everywhere sounds like a water fall, melting,  gushing, and wouldn't South Africa benefit from some of this? Balance is just another word...On the road way, not a real waterfall, just rain runoff!Oh, in case you were wondering \"Chuckanut\" comes from a native term for \" long beach far from narrow entrance\". I always thought it had something to do with squirrels, wrong, again...and, follow up on Emily's fianceHe had to wait for his insurance to kick in at the first of February before he could be seen for his symptoms.His death so easily could have been prevented had it not been for our system here, of \"let them die!\""},

At the risk of sounding like  a quack alternative wacko medicine person, This is my story.When I was in London, one day I noticed that this alien was growing out of my face, not an infection, a genuine cancer looking creepy thing irregular in shape, bumpy and weird, and growing by the minute, noticeably so, every morning it had a new, more impressive  life. I asked around , sent photos to people who know stuff...they said \"go to a doctor!!! Yesterday\"!!!I checked London for skin doctors...found one who would see me for over 200 pounds just for a consultation. NOPE.I remember , in the back of my mind reading somewhere that Zinc and ascorbic acid  were good for healing, and for skin.Went to BOOTS , bought a cheapo bottle of said  good, made a paste, applied it for three nights, and Alien cancerous looking scary thing - GONE!I am  like Jesus!I have never had a thing for cars, except for toy cars, which I can not resist it seems, I have quite too many! The only cars I have liked in real life have been the camping sort, and pick up trucks.  The vehicles that get you to where you are going and also become your resting spot, kitchen, abode, sanctuary...I lived in a VW camper van for a summer in an orchard. It was perfect! It moved at snails pace, which was also perfect. Very comfortable, everything I owned was right there, in the map pocket!Then I went back to Wyoming for another summer. My friend lived in this sheep wagon. IT was bliss! Compact, everything needed within arms reach, including a rifle and a hatchet.It seemed that every summer , a good part of it anyway, was spent in  a travel trailer, or a car, My folks loved to drive-  covered many states and Canada-me- enduring the back seat with my brother spitting on me and punching me, and making fun of my stuffed monkey, as brothers do. My Dad, smoking Lucky Strikes in the drivers seat, made sure to keep windows rolled up for maximum toxicity.  How are we still alive, we, who grew up in the fifties? It was fun when we hauled the travel trailer with us instead of staying in motels, , always an adventure, as the hitch could come loose , usually going up a mountain side. I think I may have burned out on car travel. Living in the middle of nowhere in the vast USA, cars are just part of the deal. I prefer countries where walking and bus riding are more common. I do not like to drive, at all!My folk's generation truly had a love affair with cars, Dad traded for a new one every year!He bought seven cars for me.Some of them worked.I will say, however, in spite of my dislike for car travel, going with Sarah in her car through Northumberland and around London was the most superb adventure, Sarah is a magnificent driver!!! She astonished me with her driving skills!She is not Chinese, so that is a plus.And so, here I am , back in the land of cars and gas guzzlers and horn honking . My car rattles , the wind could take it off of a bridge with a whisper! I try to not drive...but you know, umurka."},

I appreciate the shape so much, I have always been jealous of nice round heads. Mine is sort of flat because of crib days, lying likely for hours in one position while my skull was trying to shape. The little knit bear had to come along for company, they seem to be very fond of one another.Nothing much else happening up here in the dark damp- fire is barely smoldering.

The glow from travel  obfuscated , rained out, drowned, by  blandness, shoved down into an old dingy soggy sock.I did find a surprise  waiting for me that put a smile on my pasty, dull, boring  old beige face- A cow doll body, left by my friend who was using the studio when I was gone.Cows are generally  inspiring!I will give this one a think. I sent helper money to our Emily, and that cheered me up a little. It is going to be a difficult time for her.I still would like some OPIUM please, because I am a cry baby. really, though, I must share the blame - dim witted circumstance, As I always told the children when they were little and moaning about being bored- \"Only a boring person is bored, fix your problem.\"I must take this good advice ...  (send Opium anyway, please) and snap out of it.

A goodbye to Keith. Then Emily began posting her  photos of Keith and someone mentioned that he went doing what he loved most.Well into the day ,Emily's dad finally called, they had been to the airport to send her mom to Flag to help Emily. Keith was hiking with a friend, and just died! Heart attack! Em went to the trailhead to meet him , saw emergency vehicles...and that was that. No Keith ever again.BOOM, lights out, just like that *snap*. Can't quite grasp this turn of events for our Emily,  she has an army of support to be sure. Death is a bastard!I did receive happy dots in the post sent from my  friend who visited Japan while I was in London.She sent three panels of kimono pallets , vibrant color dots on silk that look like something fruity yummy to eat  with your eyes , to chase sadness into a corner.Wonderful pallets!And how that fits in with such devastating news I do not know other than that is what has happened ."},

I had a fascination for cigars when I was thirteen, went to the cigar shop and bought a Mississippi crook, soaked in rum and cured in red wine, I was hoping to get drunk, I think. That did not work out so well and I have not touched a cigar sinceI also bought a little collectors booklet of cigarette cards. Cigarettes also rejected me at an early age, Lucky that tobacco had no hold on me, in fact, it hated me.Entertainers of long ago. this is a small sampling of the cigar bands, there must be a zillion crammed in the boxes.

See her there, the one NOT by the kettle, don't you agree!Imagine my distress to find my pan missing upon return from England! Mr. Man thought it superfluous to have two so he did put mine somewhere, but could not remember where. Searched high and low, in mystery piles above the garage , in the trash, in the bathroom...could not find it , could not remember .He went out to buy a new one as I searched the Internet to replace-I found one, same vintage,  for $220.00 !!He found one at the sporting goods store which was no where near the same, made in America \"LODGE\".This will not do! (but if you ever need to buy a cast iron skillet made in America, it seems a pretty good brand.)I screwed on my determination- fuck this- hat and searched the cupboards once again and, Lo, in the dark recesses wrapped up in towels , THERE IT WAS! Day saved, skillet back on the cooker, all is well.Used them last night to make tortillas, everyone happy.The spirit of Aunt Marge is with me!

Art, science, political science through the writings of  Howard Zinn, Bertrand Russel  and Russian literature, that sort of political science! Critical thinking backed by fact based research was the norm.   Bill was also an artist , amazing carver and installation doer- nothing small, and a musician, though he would not agree. Humble .  He always made whomever he was talking with, feel special , intelligent, gifted and valued. I have never met anyone so grounded in this human condition , so experienced in forgiveness and light and love- as they say, \"an old soul\" We shared the same interests in art and literature and , of course, love for the kids. He was the kind of person who could share a glance ever so briefly and that glance said \" I SEE you, I love you, we are one\" the real deal!  \"May you be happy, may you be well, may you be filled with loving kindness, may you be peaceful and at ease\", Bill's mantra.There were fancy dress parties, buffets of gorgeous organic delicious fancy food, there was always music, Where ever Bill was you could be sure that a great time would be had, even if it was just to sit in a corner and read ...while he read...in an opposite corner.So that is that- My boy must have  surgery, I will be gone, It is a stage 3 CA with torn shredded tendons.

And an apple , a perfect little just right apple that I will have for lunch. Peaches do not usually grow in this climate, we get them from east of the mountains but THESE are wild, growing whether any one pays attention or not. I will eat them all since Mr. Man can only eat a keto diet.I am too short for how much I weigh but have lost some inches so that I can comfortably sit in the airplane seat without crowding the guy next to me ,  that guy who always wants the entire arm rest- I am sure y'all know that guy! When  way too large people travel it can be uncomfortable for everyone- taking up too much space is not a judgment call, really,taking note- it is just courtesy and common sense to want to conform to the space given.Taking too much of anything is not quite socialistic , or considerate,is it. I know- I know- people can't help it and everyone has their cross to bear- and huge folks wear their despair on the outside, I am empathetic, sympathetic, and I understand.Until airlines can accommodate these folks It is up to we who are able to become a bit smaller to make room - for that guy who likes the arm rest and the  four inches either side into the next seat, for extra space. He is doing the best he can. I must remember this. It could be me, especially after devouring the entire bowl full of peaches."},

OUCH!The apple tree is an old one, - catches it's own fruit in a nice  self wooden bowl. Children walking home from school having Apple wars.Which reminds me of a 1971 film  that I used to LOVE! The Apple War: A German business man, Volkswagner, comes to Österlen in the south of Sweden to build Deutschneyland, a gigantic amusement park for German tourists. The local councilors and the member of parliament are all in favor of the idea, although it will turn vast areas into parking lots for cars. The Lindberg family does not like the idea and with the help of a little magic, they start scheming against it. I have not see it since back in the day and would probably not like it now because I am so \"grown up\"...(old)- but back then I thought it was delightful with the fog rolling in as a way for spirits to materialize. Cool magic! Changed the way I thought of fog forevermore.And here is the same old garden shed, the owner died years ago, the shed remains , gravity taking it down  by inches every year- Making it shorter and thicker at the base, just like me. Damn you Gravity!rusty numbers on a back hoe.Came home , carrying the dog because he was tired. Fed the squirrel some peanuts . out popped these duck nuts wanting their photo taken before they became squirrel food.The squirrel comes right into the house and just looks at us- Cubby doesn't even care. They have come nose to nose. Cubby found a spider on the walk!pretty pleased with himself for finding something that might scare  his girlfriend.I got my glasses this morning and my vision is GREAT-ish. After the surgery as I said, macular degeneration in one eye was exacerbated - and so, through my left eye, this is what the world looks like.Not bad, I can live with that- as the degeneration continues as age speeds on, it will become different,  likely blind. It is common. I take mega doses of eye vitamins for it which may slow it down until I am done with seeing anyway.In the meantime I will take advantage of this new way of seeing and paint with my good eye shut.Makes a more interesting visual, these wavy lines and melty solids."},

Consequently he kept me up all night, going out, coming in, going out...The only good thing about that is that I got to hear Big Ben's chimes for the last time, noon in London- crack of predawn here. Four years of renovation on that iconic building will be like having a loved one in hospital/ rehab ...scaffolding like bandages. After walking to the dog park, and the bay, we came back up the trail  back into the neighborhood.On the street there were about twenty pots of plants in organic soil for the taking.  Poster for lost cat.This one tempted but I did not take. Number one, I could not carry it and Cubby at the same time- number two, I have no place safe to plant it.The street had been blocked off for a neighborhood pot luck/ plant give away/ party/musicWe did not stay, Cubby feeling unwell, and me feeling anti social. I need time and space to process the lifting of the lid  of the scum bucket , white supremacy,  Nazis on our streets , unleashed racism / violence and ignorance  and the Orange Baby  giving his nod.I remembered when \"difference\" first came to me at the movies...wrote this on FB yesterday- a memory.   When I was a little kid I could walk to the FOX theater and watch a matinee on Saturday afternoon for a quarter- plus five cents for pop corn. I would go alone and watch what ever was showing - it was the fifties in the middle of dirt- not much else going on. One Saturday Watching some lame Western offering- one cowboy said to the other something about \" kill the spik\" , The little girl sitting next to me , with whom I shared my popcorn and she shared licks on her Grape Charms pop- looked at each other and wondered what the hell was a spik? Her big sister had a very sad face and took her sister's hand and said \" it is us\".... I was \"a spik\" - we three walked from the theater - eye out for cowboys going to kill us, feeling gutted,- took a while for me to realize that no, actually I am one of those cowboys - privilege- so blindingly white - the sisters walked one direction and I the other, my tongue still purple and deliciously grapey from our sharing licks and spit, but the sisters could not come to my house to play- growing up in racist little Wyoming town.

Maybe two \"hot \" days - in the upper 80's- cooling to lower fifties and less in the evenings.  It could be that our house is cooler because of the flow of air throughout and because we are close to the sea .

This is the stick now!  The tree is huge, provides bird homes, curly willow for autumn  decorations for the flower shops, as it willingly sheds branches for the taking.It is beautiful every season, especially when it loses it's leaves. The branches , an interesting tangle of relationship to one another.Our pipes became clogged one summer , Mr. Man fairly convinced that the willow 's roots were the culprit. As it turns out , it 's roots are shallow and broad, the culprits were the Rhododendrons. WHEW, that was a close call for my willow.The weeping birch has met with more than one chainsaw event! It once was a magnificent umbrella but, like a hairdresser getting carried away scissoring and scissoring until there in one hair left, the wielder of the chainsaw lost track of what he was doing - it was butchery!My dear old girl, Mrs. Plum, has also been \"trimmed\" to only four major branches, she is not doing well, though pumped out some delicious fruit this season, houses the crows, jays, and squirrels, I fear her days are numbered.I reckon the chainsaw enthusiast needs to find another hobby...The Cherry tree has not been messed with and is doing very well. It was supposed to be a decorative dwarf when it was planted , it is HUGE, loads of cherries, which we leave for the birds.It seems to be out of danger for the moment.my relationship with these trees goes deep into my heart. rooted , you could say. Having been devastated by the removal of all of the Christmas trees along the drive a few years ago, (still sad) I am protective of these four trees.I will tie ribbons on them before I leave and maybe the chainsaw will have another think about tearing into them when I am gone."},

Last fall in London was really hot and humid - November was perfect -December the weather became noticeably frigid. What to take?So, I have packed up my winter gear, my eye vitamins, my \"Dead Man's Reach\" coffee addiction, and a few items to give in these three boxes!Clearly I will be unpacking these boxes and will  get everything into one pre- paid box to send to Sarah's address in Greenwich. \"Dead Man's Reach\" may get the boot.I was thinking about my travel gear - quickly wrote this sort of poem on Facbook this morning:travel suitmust have pockets andadequate fabric-an integumentwhile riding the shame trainfrom Cofefe to Brexit-buttons are preferableto mutable zipper,buttons easily replaced.it’s just common sense.Lisil ofdark blending colors-quiet, earthy-of the old school,Perduconsideration-when travel abruptly stopsthis suit will be that of eternitymake sure comfortis of primary concernand pockets, of course.must have lifetimes of pocketsWith that in mind I can forget about most of what I have packed and just get down to REAL. What is essential.Always tend to go overboard. Which brings me to this past blast: one of my exaggerated eras.We lived in San Diego, rented a house with too many bedrooms. At that point we only had two dogs, Brandy the Setter, who, as a puppy got run over, paralyzing and squishing his back legs - he was such a lovely animal we nursed him back to some semblance of mobility , carrying him out to pee and poo, until he could sort of hobble on one crooked leg. What a trooper he was.And Poppins the sheep dog, a gem of a girl- Eleanor the cat was a freak - ran away after a few years- to go live in the slaughter house , more to her liking.Eleanor made short work of the canary, a little yellow funeral followed.While driving out in the country , we saw  a German Shepard tied to a post, A man carrying a rifle getting ready to point and shoot the dog. We saved her, She was feral and pregnant though we did not realize. We loved her , she became docile and then BOOM nine puppies! All of them gorgeous, two died from her nipping the  umbilical cord too closely.  Then the tally was NINE dogs , one insane cat, and a dead bird.The many bedrooms now full of dogs. My idea of heaven....at least for a while. It was unrealistic to keep them all, even after we had given them names and stations.Too much of a good thing is still too much, so, like unpacking the too many boxes- we found homes for all but Poppins, Kept her and traveled on up the coast for more adventure."},

{"title": "but I did not die", "date": "Monday, August 7, 2017", "text": "When I left  university , I drove to the Mojave desert in my funky little rambler sedan, and went to work and live on a horse training ranch. Loved the vast desert - loved  the horses-the ability to hop on the only horse that would tolerate me and my inexperience, Sunshine . Bareback I could  take off for hours. The freedom was  heaven - that sweet gentle  chestnut mare, humored me -  aware of my limitations , trotting smoothly, making me look like I had been born on a horse. Living on the ranch was a dream, and I had my own bunk, was fed home made pies, made about two dollars BUT it was not about the money was it. My job was simple, to ride Zero , the donkey down the ditches , opening up the valves for irrigation-I was thrown by Zero , many times- but I did not die.I did a bunch of other stuff after the ranch, and  finally  made my way to England -worked seasonally-  lived in a hop hut, no electricity , no running water, Cooked outside on a fire where I washed clothes and bathed  in a livestock tub. The orchards of Kent, lush, abundant, on a privately owned farm by a creek were  idyllic to be sure, the company was superb- one of  our tribe was a traveler who came back every year to earn enough money to go back to Nepal. He brought Hashish  which we made into a custard to eat on freshly picked apples ,after a  long/hard days work.  Below is the hop hut, me with a kitten named Loki and a hen named Egg.  A wad of Opium offered by my Nepal friend, made me very sick and  dreaming for two or three days , but I did not die...  The most interesting place I think where I have lived , was aboard a sailboat sailing the sound. No motor, no electricity, a Neptune stove to cook on , which  barely kept us from freezing to death as the bay froze solid! This is a lifestyle I would not want to revisit, It was fun but demanding . I am a land lubber after all. An anchor fell on my foot , caused a huge infection and a foot three times what it ought to have been, the infection was serious...I did not die.Back on land-  in a cabin in the village, with wood heat, where I grew my own food, canned it, traded it,  smoked a lot of weed, took classes at the U, got a degree- all typical of that era and the hippie town in which we lived. Earned some cash for travel.Went places.For  three months I lived in a haunted house in Melbourne Australia. I am holding a rambunctious puppy, because the ghosts would not leave and the puppy was freaked.Another adventure I would not want to repeat. The ghosts were depressing and I felt a little bit insane...but I did not die.Came back to the states-During summer months on the Olympic Peninsula I lived in a tee pee while working the trails, building foot bridges and clearing fallen timber,  without power equipment , using hand saws , heavy rope, and innovation. On a path below  the tee pee ,  there was an abandoned hot spring, and a  burned down lodge  from the turn of the century, a \"danger\" zone a \"Keep OUT\"  worth the risk- the soak in hot spring water after a day of \"man\" work in the forests, probably saved us. Stabbed myself on a rusty burnt spike,  wounded, did not die...I've lived off the grid many times, prefer that lifestyle,...  and did not die.Everyday  an adventure in nature.And then....  -I joined society- I began to die a little-the house in which I have lived for the past thirty  has served us well-house of choice for all of the children when Erik was growing up, Lively - easy to clean- predictable ...but  It is a sissy and lacks imagination - like a  tomb- children gone  - in an aging neighborhood- this house is trying to kill me with normalcy and central heating.I may  just die."},

She always hated this photo because she though they looked like a couple of hillbillies., Porch in the process of curing before the steps could be added, Front yard a mud pit.Later My Dad added a dining room and a garage, patio, garden, incinerator , finished the basement, had a son and a daughter, and tried like hell to keep trees in the yard though the Wyoming wind blew them all away.It was a sweet little house, the blizzards. 50 degree below winters, and incessant howling wind did not impress it at all. Solid as a fortress.My parents finally left to find some earth where the wind did not blow you sideways every bloody day. House sold to a person who had no interest in keeping it up. It fell into horrible disrepair, the hand made picket fence and gates used for fire wood, the garden and fruit tree leveled - replaced with stones , dust, weeds. She moved on selling it to someone else  three years ago who recognized promise in the little house- It is on a good corner lot , close to downtown, great little neighborhood...there was hope for this little house- great bones.They have been bringing it back to life over the past three years.This is it today!While tearing out the basement which my Dad finished  as a laundry room, furnace room, lapidary work shop, Carpentry, and my brother's very large bedroom and hang out, They found this in the wall.My brother had hollowed out the wall, constructed a pulley system , where he hid french cigarettes, porn, badges from the army surplus- WW2, other treasures- mostly naughty- and photos of girlfriends.The new owner posted Harise's photo on our hometown page, Facebook,  asking if anyone knew Marvin, that she would like to send him this photo.There'll be no sending it to Marvin, he is dead but I would love to have it- a sort of nod and wink from my brother, A memory so sweet, I loved this girl. I loved that I was the only one who knew about his pulley system , that I kept his secret from our parents forever.My Dad would be sad to know that his lush gardens and attempts to keep trees in the yard, his picket fence , the house he built fell into near ruin.So grateful for the new owner, Our little house is loved again, though the walls have betrayed my brother. Now everyone knows and his pulley system - removed.You have no idea how difficult it was to garden where we lived, to cultivate a rich soil out of dust, a growing season of two and a half months. But my Dad had a green thumb, vegetable garden loads of flowers, raspberries, lilacs, an apple tree which eventually the wind sent as far as Medicine Bow- Our lawn was always the greenest though cars cut the corner and tore it up frequently, thus the new barrier the new owners installed.A straight shot down Buffalo street into town, less than a mile's walk. My Dad's marigolds along the fence.Sweet. Sweet memories and a happy ending."},

The weight of mental illness.I know that I do not really NEED more paints, I am a hoarder of paints...BUT look at this set! IT is astonishing, and the hues are just as vibrant  used with water,  as they appear in the box! A little goes a long way, I will be taking this set with me, a couple of brushes, four favorite pencils and that will be all I need, probably... maybe....no promises....I am a liar.... Art shops and book stores are danger areas for me, I would rather buy a tube of paint than dinner! I have been known to spend my last  bit of stipend on poetry or art books.while clearing out the china hutch, My Obama sticker fell out, I nearly cried...God, I love this man. The low level depression , anxiety, frustration, outrage, fear that fills every breathing space since the Orange Turd shat in the white house could also be  a large part of the reason my dear neighbor can not face the day. She is terrified- an immigrant, worried about her family. wondering if she will ever get to go back to her motherland to see siblings and folks before they are all gone. So much can contribute to a mental breakdown, the Orange Turd has been , for many, the final straw, and camel 's back is well and truly broken."},

Multiple epidemiological studies suggest that cataract surgery accelerates the progression of AMD. Many of these population-based studies are, however, reports of prevalence, and it is hard to differentiate between association and causation. The effect of cataract surgery on AMD gets further confused when one looks at early as opposed to late disease and wet as opposed to dry AMD and considers the standards used to evaluate and grade the macular degeneration. In addition, there is inconsistency in the risk factors being controlled statistically. For instance, the Beaver Dam Eye Study reported an association between cataract surgery and early AMD; Freeman and colleagues found an association between cataract surgery and late AMD2; the Blue Mountains Eye Study did not find an association between cataract surgery and either early or late AMD; and the Rotterdam Study found an association between cataract surgery and early AMD but not wet AMD.A recent prospective uncontrolled study of 71 patients with non-neovascular AMD found that, at 12 months after phacoemulsification cataract surgery, the rate of progression to neovascular AMD in this cohort was not higher than what would have been expected without the surgery.3Another study looked at the 10-year incidence of AMD and its association with both cataract and cataract surgery.4 The investigators found that cataract at baseline was associated with early AMD, but not with late AMD. At 10 years after cataract surgery, there was an increased incidence of late AMD. These findings are interesting because of the temporal relationship between the events, and the long-term follow-up at 10 years. The authors conclude that cataract surgery increased the risk for late AMD.)))I went in just fine and came out with Macular degeneration , I can not see.fuckBUT, here is a good thing, the lad is still here, he may fly out to the island tomorrow , first though, he will take me to another eye guy in the morning. I did drive today , to get something from the grocery . Stopped to let a person cross the road only to realize that it was a power box on a short pole.I am probably dangerous. I am now beginning to feel uneasy about staying in Brixton for four and half months. Oh well, if it is too sketchy I will just eat the non refundable rent and go elsewhere, I am flexible that way...The stats are not great for Brixton, the most heavily crime ridden part of the city. Guess I will know when I get there, won't I.So, people, this is just to remind you to trust yourself.That's all."},

He performed the first extracapsular cataract extraction on April 8, 1747. It was the first significant advance in cataract surgery since couching was invented.I can not even imagine how primitive and horrid that must have been, On Thursday I had one eye done, the next to be done the following Thursday. I had no idea what to expect other than everyone telling me what a piece of cake the surgery is and how well the eye works afterwards.I have not been able to see  well for some time now, which may explain the huge flowers that I felted  Large is the only size that works for me . Colors have been peculiar  as well , Reds pop forward like 3-D, off the page or out of a paintings- also  have not been able to read for well over a year now, and wearing two pair of glasses one on top of the other, has not helped much. So looking forward to having my eyesight restored has been exciting, promising! Can't wait!! WHOOPEE! Stella drove me  all the way to another town down south to the surgery, and waited around for what we thought would be quick , painless , a snap, a piece of cake, right? Everyone says so....The cake is a lie!! It has not been the most pleasant of experiences.so much lying going on these days!!!- I could feel everything being done, not enough numbing and not enough \"I don't care\" medication.I will know next time and tell them to give me the entire pantry - triple, please !Stella saved my life...AGAIN. - brought pain meds for me - one for  immediately and one before bed, WHEW!  She knows stuff!! Stella is a goddam SAINT!- large black glasses  could afford me a whole new career , yeah, man, Me and Stevie...Ebony and ivory...looks like I will be wearing these forevermore, eyes are more fragile after being messed with, they say. Could be a lie...In 1923 at the age of 82, Claude Monet finally relented , had  surgery on one eye. At first he was pleased, though having had impaired vision for so long (thus his blurry /soft style)- the clarity and bright colors terrified him .Before his vision became clouded over nearly entirely- he did not complain- he liked the world as he saw it- melding and foggy ,  \"It's very beautiful all the same and it is what I would love to be able to convey\", he stood out from the crowd of fabulous painters during that time. as the cataracts grew more dense, however, his painting became  dull and muddy. The surgery did not bail him out. One eye could not see violets and blues , the other could.After surgery he painted opening  one eye at a time .and the light was never restored to it's previous glory.Of course I am hoping that what everyone else has said  about this surgery being  a magnificent miracle will occur in time , after the swelling diminishes, the globs of tar floaters cease, the bleeding eyeball thing becomes less bloody, and vision actually happens- I will be among those folks...right now, not so much."},

Not magnificent.The tea was decent  enough. The tea garden- disappointing ! Do not believe boxes!

The carrot that is all fluff and bluster is America, and it is toxic.Broken, everything is Broken!Dangerous, threatening, gassed by the orange terror.I immediately booked another flight to London in September, enough time to organize my life here , rent a flat, buy a ticket. Mr. America in a straight jacket.At least the weather has improved, took it's time, through a blustery dark cold rainy spring.  Nothing else can be made sense of right now, Sun has arrived,  sushi on the rail to feed my new friend.Mr. Crow,  whom I have named Sushi, for obvious reason,He comes every morning to let me know it is time for breakfast.Biding our time. Fight or flight? You guessed it!"},
{"title": "Well mannered and sorry", "date": "Sunday, June 25, 2017", "text": "The one word  said most often in England, is \"SORRY\". Sorry /not sorry but well -intentioned.  The civility of the British is admirable,  Understated rage, understated joy, understated insults, they are well practiced and use exquisite vocabularies to  dismiss you or dress you down, and make you feel very good about it.Reading \"SORRY! The English and Their Manners\" by Henry Hitchings,    taking it in small doses, packed with rules,  contrivances , historical and outdated hilarity , frustrating, but most of all Charming- civil.Where to draw the line between being mannerly- and being disingenuous. Not sure.  America is such a baby with it's habit of blurting without too much thought or regard for the other person's  feelings -  without   delicately  dancing around issues using gentle language and a bit of  self depreciation . Blurting is messy, though genuine, and passionate, generally speaking- one can pretty much trust that what is being regurgitated is truly what it is, and isn't that why we are in the pickle that we are in... There is no code breaking, which the British have plenty of: \"interesting\"= tedious nonsense. a BRAVE plan= an insane one.\"Quite good\"= disappointing\"It's my fault\"= It's your fault\"I shall bear that in mind\"= I'm going to forget that immediatelyThe intention is not to deceive, it is to be civil, to be kind.   England's well mannered lives make coming back to America feel like re-entering  a very  bad middle school specializing in bullying ,  a thick skin is essential, otherwise there will be crying all day, every day and the wringing of hands until  they become ineffectual stumps.Discourse has become extremely  volatile since this Orange administration has shat on the entire nation, hand in hand with the KKK, the NRA, and the Bannon agenda of \" scorch the earth\". America is such a child with a toddler at the helm- little wonder Britain offers respite.Yes, yes, May is a jerk and Brexit sucks, but, the population remains as they have always been, delightful, charming,  thoughtful...and sorry. And will offer an old lady a seat on the tube every time!!"},
{"title": "What does Libby do?", "date": "Saturday, June 24, 2017", "text": "Queen Elizabeth is an illusion  of  stability in the western world, she has been here longer than dirt! I admire the QUEEN, though she really serves no purpose other than ceremony, and spending her subject's hard earned cash, and wearing excellent hats.  She owns the land, citizens are her subjects, She owns the sea surrounding the island  and all of the whales therein. She has the power to  rule against laws brought forth by Parliament, but never does- she would rather not deal with scandal-too messy . That is nearly unforgivable , given BREXIT and it has been said that she may lawfully remove the head of any visiting politician deemed unworthy.  Now would be a good time for her to step up. Always been a fixture in our lives and at 91, is remarkably going about doing what ever it is that Libby does.No body is quite sure...We spend her  face , on Canadian bills.and on notes. that portray her  wearing an athletic mouth guard .Unfortunate choice, Libby...just sayin'Her ubiquitous portrait is found on very nearly everything, She even has an action figure, which I am sure to obtain next time I am in London- A solar powered waving Queen , useless really, much like the power of Libby.I love the Queen, I love the IDEA of her, I love her artificial contrived ceremonious life which seems so stable and sensible from afar. A touchstone.Though, when I walk by or in her palaces as a paying peasant, everything seems  like ancient  movie props, the chairs are tiny, the halls are not wide, the velvet is worn. Everything is SO so so old. Yet I am enthralled.My son gave me this refrigerator magnet- knowing that I idolize her probably too much - reminding me that  in the end , she is simply a bag of meat like the rest of us.I came so close to seeing her when we were at Windsor, We went to buy post cards - bad timing on our part . She came out onto the lawn , waved and smiled and  probably looked for me...so sorry to disappoint . I remain her biggest fan! My imaginary friend, Queen Libby!We stayed in Lady Margaret's town house in London for three weeks a few years ago. Her presence  felt -not physically, we never did meet her,  except for her curlers.The weather, typically humid, stuck my hair to my damp face with no air in between strands. My hair is ridiculous , fine and limp at best.I found her curlers, in a drawer. They saved the day, overnight. Slept uncomfortably as the curlers were pokey plastic, vivid dreams , that were not mine...Like a Twilight Zone episode, Lady Margaret's curlers, having been so close to her brain , held  her thoughts,  her worries, her passion for England, her love of  green growing things. My having used something so close and personal was probably not right- who even DOES that!!  I did  and awoke to find my hair less flat , kind of fluffy,  and my brain somewhat changed. A fierce  yearning for ENGLAND , an appreciation for  climbing roses and church bells clanging out the hours, obsess me, and a craving for builder's tea from footed pot! I want biscuits, I want Marmite on toast. I want to soften my \"r's\".Of course my DNA might have something to do with my love for ENGLAND, it tingles when I am there, Wearing London like an old  comfortable slipper . Lady Margaret's curlers finally stabbed  it into my brain from her brain through the curlers, I am hooked!Fair warning to you all , you may want to reconsider using some one else's personal items....or not.Thus I have been possessed  by Lady Margaret ,  her love of Albion , the Queen. and sausage. I have returned twice since then and will be going back this September, though staying in another part of London, which I can not seem to get enough of.  \"the strange intersection of the shadow land of the Twilight Zone , cue music- aaaannnnddddd-   You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension - a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone.I do not know What Lady Margaret looks like but I am pretty sure I am beginning to resemble her"}
