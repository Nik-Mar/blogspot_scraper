{"title": "One Roll Review - Reflx Lab 200T", "date": "Sunday, January 14, 2024", "text": "I was recently contacted by Reflx Lab to see if I’d like to try out their 200T 35mm film, and of course, I said yes.  There are so many new rebranded films turning up now, that it’s getting hard to keep track of them.  In 2022, I reviewed their 400D ECN-2 film which was Eastman Vision 3 250D with the remjet layer already removed, so that it could be processed in any lab offering C-41 service.  That was “early days” for Reflx Lab, and I pointed out a few minor defects in the emulsion on the rolls, as well as light piping at the beginning.  Otherwise, I still liked what I saw.  Unless you have been in a cave or the middle of the Amazon forest for the past few years, you know that the Cinestill brand has been selling Kodak ECN-2 films with the remjet removed, and in their branding, advertised every ECN-2 film with a raised ISO, supposedly because the remjet removal raised the sensitivity.  I think that’s just marketing bullshit, but it created a unique niche that until recently, had been occupied only by them.  So, in late 2023, when other resellers started selling the same exact films with the remjet removed, Cinestill took aggressive action because they’d been granted a trademark status on 800T.  While it was certainly wrong for them to claim 800T as a trademark, it opened a whole lot of ill will towards Cinestill, and much of it was deserved.  So, in the aftermath, other brands have come up with unique ways to advertise their remjet-removed Vision 3 films.  That’s where Reflx Lab comes in with their 200T film in this review.The Reflx Lab  200T box uses a stylized T that looks like a lamp bulb.  Ingenious!  The  other thing about this film is that it really is a 200 ISO Tungsten-balanced film.  It’s Kodak Vision 3 200T, but with the remjet layer already removed so that it can be safely developed at your local lab.A couple of things about the remjet layer that you should know by now.  First, it acts as an antihalation layer, and second, it acts as an antistatic layer and third, it sort of lubricates and avoids scratches as the the film travels through the movie camera.  That’s significant, because cine film moves far faster through a movie camera than a 35mm still camera.  Without the remjet in a still camera, the only real problem will be from the removal of the antihalation properties.  That means you’ll be more likely to see “blooming” from point light sources or backlit scenes.  In a color film, it’s going to result in reddish tints from the halation.  Some photographers love the effect, especially in shooting night scenes.  I’m most familiar with the halation in b&w films, and it can be a good thing in the right circumstances.  So, it’s just something that you should be aware of, if you choose to shoot any ECN-2 film that’s had the remjet pre-removed.I put a roll of the 200T in my Nikon N75, and shot the roll within a couple of days in early January.  After I shot the first few frames, I remembered to attach an 85 filter to compensate for shooting in daylight with the Tungsten-balanced film.  The film cassette is DX-coded, so if you are using a camera that requires a DX code (such as the N75), you will be just fine using the Reflex Lab film.  I only had a few shots indoors, and I took off the 85 filter for those.  After I finished the roll, it was processed by my local lab in Asheville- Ball Photo.The Reflx Lab 200T film scanned easily in my Epson V700, and the results are very good overall. However, as you will see below, backlighting and point light sources cause halation with reddish blooming.  a little blue-ish, no #85 filterthat light poking between the boards, and it was not sunnygreat color renditionYou can really see the halation with the light peepingbetween those boards!a very well-rendered scenethose spotlights...Comparing this film with my experience from 2022, shows a very improved process from Reflx Lab.  There was no light piping at the beginning/end of the roll, no strange artifacts, and no residual remjet.  In fact, the film is as good as any C-41 film that I have used - however, as I stated earlier, halation needs to be taken into consideration when planning your shots.  I’ve only shot one roll so far, and I’ll shoot another roll in the evening sometime to see how well the Tungsten-balanced film looks indoors with good lighting, and also with neon signs.There are many choices now that other companies have figured out how to remove the remjet layer from ECN-2 films before packaging them for the consumer. You can send your money to Cinestill,  Reflx Lab, or to Reto, and try these films for yourself.  Personally, I like the Reflx Lab films, and they are now found on the shelves in brick and mortar photo stores.  That’s good news for the consumer, and there are more choices than ever.  However, if you like the DIY approach, there’s no shame in buying regular ECN-2 films and doing the remjet removal as part of your developing process.  You’ll certainly avoid the halation problem, and also save a bit of money as well.  Overall, yes, I like the Reflx Lab 200T, and I am looking forward to shooting more of it.  Maybe I’ll even try some “800T,” but without the Cinestill branding."},
{"title": " 2023 - Another great year for film users", "date": "Thursday, December 28, 2023", "text": "Millbrook Diner, Kodak Aerocolor.Here it is, almost the end of December, and it’s a good time to review some events of 2023, both good and bad, that involve film-based photography.  In the digital world, it’s all about mirrorless wonders from Nikon, Canon, Leica, Fuji, etc., but over here in film land, we rarely get new film cameras, so we get excited by new film stocks, right?  Of course, there was the announcement by Ricoh/Pentax about a new film camera project, and we will have to wait to see where that goes. The release of the Polaroid I-2 advanced instant camera was met with enthusiasm by many, and jeers by a few. I’m never going back to any instant cameras, but if I was looking for  one, the I-2 certainly has all the bells and whistles that makes it stand out apart from any others currently on the market.  I can’t really get excited by any of the simple-use cameras that arrived in 2023.  I get that they are designed to attract a different segment of the market, and anything new and shiny that takes 35mm film is at least better than nothing at all.  The Kodak Ektar H35N doesn’t do it for me, as I’ve had my fling with GOOD half-frame cameras, and I’m not about to use another one.  But if you are looking to maximize your picture-taking on a single roll of film, the H-35N could be a good choice for you.  Take a look at Dave Mihaly’s YouTube videos and make your decision from them.  Yes, I have done a lot of photography with cheap plastic cameras, and I have my favorites.  But, I don’t need to buy any of these “new” plastic cameras currently being sold.  That brings me to Lomography, which as long been the home of the plastic fantastic (and not necessarily cheap).  Some models that were out of stock are now back in production, such as the Lomo Kino (at $60, a bargain), and the Spinner 360 (less than $50).  Say what you want, but Lomo has been innovative, interesting, and has been a big booster for analog photography.  I’m sure there have been some interesting introductions of other film cameras this year, and I apologize for not covering some of the boutique offerings in the pinhole and large-format world.  As the saying goes, “if you know, you know.”FILMSThe year started out with the stock of color films being low, and price hikes had a lot of folks bitching about that. I get it, and for some people, finding that they’d spent over $15 for a roll of film, $30 for processing and prints or scans, it was a bridge too far.  It wasn’t the best for anyone wanting to get started, especially with their $50 simple-use camera, and getting back a bunch of underexposed shots.  For us old-timers (since I’m not a 30-something YouTuber - I’m twice their age, so I’m probably a film dinosaur) film prices haven’t been the limiting factor in the avocation.  But  yes, color film was definitely more expensive in the beginning of the year than at the end, when Kodak and Lomography were discounting their 120 film stocks.  The rising prices and scarcity of C-41 films definitely drove up the interest in using ECN-2 films, especially from sellers that were removing the remjet so that the films could be developed by any C-41 lab.  That lead us to the Cinestill 800T shit show, and enough has already been said about that on social media, YouTube, and blogs.  My opinion, for what it’s worth, is that Cinestill was improperly granted a license to trademark 800T.  Second, they don’t want competition from sellers like Reflx Labs in China.  Third, we all want a bargain, so vote with your wallet.  Rem-jet removed films such as Amber (from RETO), Reflx Labs, and others are definitely cheaper than the Cinestill versions — and they are the same emulsions. Lomography’s introduction of Lomochrome Color ’92 added another unique film stock to an already interesting array of films.  I reviewed that film (https://randomphoto.blogspot.com/2023/08/one-roll-review-lomochrome-color-92.html) in August.  With Metropolis, Turquoise, and Purple, you can do some fun stuff.  Lomochrome Purple in particular, gives results somewhat akin to a color IR film.  The winner for the least-hyped color film is Kodak Aerocolor, which is being repackaged under various names, such as Elektra 100, Santa Color 100, Reflx Lab Pro 100, and Karmir 160.  Aerocolor is a fine-grained aerial photography film with great latitude, and a lot of people are just discovering it.  If Kodak/Alaris could get their shit together, they’d be offering Aerocolor  as a Kodak product in 35mm and 120.  Instead, they have siloed the different divisions and that’s to their detriment.   The winner for the most-hyped color film is obviously Harman Phoenix.  I’ve never seen a film rollout like this one, and love it or hate it, Phoenix is a unique emulsion. Lens caps off to Harman for their foray into the world of color.  I’ve shot one roll so far, and I’ll wait for a day with light clouds and no bright sun for the next one.   I believe that the Kentmere Pan 100 and 400 are two of the least-expensive b&w films out there, and in my experience, give outstanding results.  I’ve used them for years, when they were only sold as Ultrafine Extreme by Photo Warehouse, in California. Now, in their own branding, the Kentmere films are an excellent value in 35mm and 120.Reflx Lab in China has been doing a great job with their branding and selling of various film stocks, and their recent introductions of several ECN-2 films with the remjet removed so that they can be developed as C-41 is a great thing.  In my local camera store - Ball Photo, in Asheville, I’m seeing more variety of films than ever before.  Sure, some of them are just rebranded stocks, but if that gets someone to try one out, all the better.The Film Photography Project just keeps rolling along with their films for still and cine cameras.  Their catalogue of FPP-branded film stocks is impressive, and while it’s the place to go for the unusual, they also sell the major brands at the best prices.  Another very positive development (the photo puns write themselves) is the production of Kodak-branded photochemistry coming back to the USA.  Photo Systems, Inc. in Dexter, MI which used to be known as Unicolor, will be producing Kodak-branded photo chemistry.  I toured that facility a number of years ago, and it looks like Dexter, MI will be seeing ever more semi-trucks coming and going from that factory.  In case anyone forgets, Kingsport, TN is the home of Eastman Chemical, which used to make photo chemistry there.  That’s about an hour from my home.Deaths (certainly not comprehensive)The permanence of great photography is exemplified by Elliot Erwitt, who died at the age of 95. His images have appeared in various books and monographs.  He left us with many indelible images of the every-day that were never ordinary.  https://www.elliotterwitt.com/John Fielder, a well-known photographer of the natural scenes in Colorado, died at 73. https://www.cpr.org/2023/08/13/john-fielder-photographer-colorado-outdoors-died-at-73-years-old/Frank Borman, astronaut, died in November, at the age of  95 - took the first photograph on the Apollo 8 mission of the earth from the moon - that image is lesser known than the one taken by William Anders - Earth Rise- which inspired a consciousness  of Earth being our home, alone in the cosmos.  Those Hasselblad cameras were instrumental in the Apollo program, and the quality of the images from them are unsurpassed, especially when you consider the environment in which they were used.Frank Borman's photoLarry Fink, well-known for his photography in Greenwich Village, and chronicling the Beat generation, died at 72.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt9M2aQAFT0Lawrence McFarland, photographer and educator, died at 81.  Known for his landscapes, he was a respected professor of photography at the University of Texas, Austin. https://www.lawrencemcfarlandphoto.com/homeJohn Benton-Harris, photographer/visual sociologist, died at 83.  An American in the UK, he was renowned for his photo essays of the British people. https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/oct/23/john-benton-harris-obituaryHelen Marcus, a noted photographer of the famous in New York, died at 97.

All of them were well-received.  I shot well over 100 rolls of film, developed most of it myself.  The nascent Asheville Camera Club published a zine, and is now meeting monthly. For once, I am just a participant, not an organizer.   I didn’t go on any lengthy road trips, which I hope to make up for in 2024.  However, I did pretty well with trips to Michigan, Ohio, New York, and South Carolina.I hope 2024 goes well for everyone (well, almost everyone - democracy has to survive). How did 2023 work out for you?"},
{"title": "Twenty Years of Holgas", "date": "Tuesday, December 19, 2023", "text": "Yes, this is a pitch for my latest issue of Monochrome Mania!  First of all, when I started Monochrome Mania in 2020, I had no idea that I would be publishing a 12th issue just a few years later.  Yes, for me, it's my creative outlet, and more importantly, I'm able to reach many more people with a zine than with a gallery showing.  Twenty Years of Holgas actually started in about 2001, when I got my first Holga.  But, it really was not until 2003 that I was using one to create memorable images.  I don't care what camera that you use, but it takes some time before you are really proficient with it. With a Holga, that means accepting its limitations, but also knowing when you can push it beyond the \"snapshot\" with technique, choice of film, and subject choice.In preparing this issue, I reviewed many hundreds of negatives from my Holgas. Luckily, I had almost all of them scanned in previously when I was working on the medium format toy cameras for MM No. 3, which is now out of print.  Still, reducing 20+ years of photos down to less than 50 images is a feat.   It's not like I have shot with a Holga every day every year, either. I was most prolific with the Holga between 2007-2010, and there are a few years that I hardly shot with it.  Nevertheless, the Holga  is still a camera that gives me wonderful results in certain situations, and I continue to use it.   Could this be a prelude to a larger work?  Maybe.  I still have many stories to tell with toy cameras, and the Holga hasn't been the only instrument for that.Here are a few samples from this latest issue.Twenty Years of  Holgas is 48 pages, including the covers, and measures 8,5 x 8.5 inches. It's a quality print publication, done by Mixam.  I have changed my shipping to USA-only.  International shipping now costs almost as much as the zine, and to be honest, it's a pain in the butt to ship internationally, as Etsy does not handle that aspect very well.    Here are a few images that did not make the zine issue."},
{"title": "Harman Phoenix 200 - One Roll Review", "date": "Monday, December 11, 2023", "text": "Like a lot of people, I’ve been curious about Harman’s release of an experimental color film, and like a lot of people, I really had no advance information about it.  No, I’m not a YouTube influencer, getting a preview at the Harman factory, nor did they send me an advance info packet.  Mike Raso of the FPP sent me a package with two rolls of the Phoenix film, along with the promotional info packet from Harman just a day after it was officially released.  I’ve been reviewing various film stocks on RCB for many years, and I’d like to think that my thoughts on various films have been helpful.  Most of the time, I have purchased the films that I review.  Initial thoughtsFirst and foremost, I am thrilled that another manufacturer is taking a stab at doing color emulsions.  Yes, there are a bunch of different C-41 and ECN-2 films available, and some films supposedly from Europe are almost likely to be old stock, or repackaged Kodak Aerocolor film.  So, the idea that Harman would even attempt to produce a C-41 color film is pretty amazing. Yes, it’s touted as “experimental” even on the film box, but it’s a start.  Second, this experimental film has already been YouTubed to death.  I wasn’t even sure that I was going to review it, but getting two rolls from the FPP definitely encouraged me to test it.  I live in Western North Carolina, so December might not be the optimum time for a film test, but I am giving it a go anyways.  Third, I’m a sucker for oddball films.  Since I don’t usually have high expectations, I like it when a film favorably surprises me. It’s not always about color fidelity, either.  That’s the beauty of film vs digital.  If I want real color fidelity, I can always shoot with one of my DSLRs. Odd color shifts like we see in some of the Lomography films are something that digital just can’t do without a LOT of post-processing. The serendipitous nature of these oddball films means I’ll probably get at least a few shots that convince me to keep using them for special projects.  Phoenix 200Harman had been sending out teasers on social media for several weeks before Phoenix 200 was actually released.  Yes, I think almost everyone thought it was going to be a color film, but that’s all most of us knew.  Coming from a factory that does b&w, it seemed quite the challenge.   My way of working with any film for the first time is to shoot it at the box speed listed by the manufacturer.  So, I knew that I was going to shoot roll number 1 at ISO 200 before I even put it in my camera.  I used my Nikon FM3A and my 50mm f/2 Nikkor-H that I have already raved about in this blog.Over the course of two days, I shot it in later afternoon sun, and midday sun/slight overcast.  After shooting the roll, I dropped it off at Ball Photo in Asheville to get it developed only. No prints or scans.  I picked it up today, and the staff was very curious about this film.  No orange mask! I figured that since Harman/Ilford has a C-41 chromogenic XP-2, the film base may be the same as the XP-2. However, that’s just my opinion.  No orange mask is not a big deal, as the Kodak Aerocolor and all the rebrands of it, also do not have an orange mask.I like that the film has “Experimental” as a descriptor.  It’s certainly a step in the direction of making a good color film, but as you will see, it has a ways to go.  The negatives on my light table, taken with iphoneInverted, just as they are - not too bad.I scanned the film on my Epson V700, and after previewing the thumbnails, I went and adjusted the curves for every exposure, except for a few. Then, I worked with the files in Corel Paint Shop Pro (no damn Adobe subscription for me), which I have used since 2008.  In most cases, I corrected for faded colors to get what I thought was a better image than straight out of the scanner.  As others have noted, the film has noticeable grain.  The shadow detail is like shooting underexposed slide film on a sunny day.  Very contrasty.   This is all at the box speed, of course.  Now that I have shot that initial roll, I’ll probably shoot the film at ISO 80 or 100 on the next one.  In Epson Scan, I had to adjust the levels for every image.However, it definitely improved the resultAnyhow, here are some examples from this first roll.  I chose colorful subjects to test out the color rendition of Phoenix 200.  Surprisingly, this last shot on the roll was fine the way it was!As you can see, the results are not bad after tweaking nearly every image to my liking.  It almost reminds me of shooting some of the FPP Retrochrome.  The film definitely has a different look than the run-of-the-mill Kodak Gold 200.  Things that can mess up an exposure - too much contrast between light and dark areas, and shooting into the sun.  Shooting at highly reflective objects with specular highlight will show that their is no antihalation layer on the film.  Is this a film that I would buy?  Well, it's experimental, so I would hope that Harman will improve version 2, and I'd definitely give that a try.  One thing I noticed was that inverting the iPhone shot of the negatives gave me a pretty good result, so maybe this is an instance where DSLR \"scanning\" would produce better results than my flatbed scanner.  As it is, this is a film that in its current state, requires more than the usual post-processing to get an image that is appealing to me.  Other photographers may find it suits them just fine -- or not! I would not expect perfect results right out of the box, so that might be a non-starter for a lot of folks.  BUT -- I greatly appreciate what Harman is doing and hope that they continue to improve their film."},
{"title": "Coming soon... FPP's 620 Color!", "date": "Wednesday, November 29, 2023", "text": "Back in October, I received some rolls of film to test for the Film Photography Project.  Two were from  a batch of color film rolled onto 620 spools by a vendor for the FPP.  What's not to like?  How many of us have cameras that use 620 film?  Back when I was testing various models for my guide to medium format toy cameras, (Monochrome Mania No. 3 - now out of print), I respooled a bunch of b&w film.  My fingers got cramps doing it.  Aside from a few cameras that really deserve my respooling efforts, I haven't used 620 all that much lately.  However, COLOR on 620 is pretty hard to resist.  My favorite low-fi 620 cameras have been the Kodak Brownie Reflex 20 (pictured below) and the Kodak Brownie Twin 20.  Both cameras are quite similar feature-wise, and a lot of fun to use.  I loaded the FPP 620 Color Beta Test 2023 into the Reflex 20, and shot the roll locally and while on my trip to Dutchess County, NY at the end of October.When I went to unload the finished roll from the camera, it slipped from my hand and I had to re-roll the backing paper a bit to tighten it, so I probably introduced some edge light leaks, which showed up when I got the developed film back from Ball Photo in Asheville.Anyhow, I love the results overall, and the Film Photography Project's new 620 film is for now, a \"beta\" film, yet to be officially released.  Keep your eye on their announcements for this film.  It's certainly going to be a welcome addition for anyone wanting to use a 620 camera!"},
{"title": "The Lomo Apparat -  a quick take", "date": "Tuesday, November 21, 2023", "text": "Lomography introduced the Apparat 35mm camera in 2022, and while I was somewhat interested in the new camera, its price of $90 was a bit off-putting. Furthermore, it was an all-plastic camera - which isn’t surprising, but I decided a while ago not to jump right on a new Lomography product until I had seen some reviews about it.  In October 2023, KEH had a 20% off sale on some film cameras, and lo and behold -- a brand new Apparat for a reasonable price, so I ordered one.The past couple of years has seen a number of simple plastic 35mm cameras coming to market, most of which are quite similar in features.  The Apparat though, features a 21mm lens with an integral  rectangular lens hood, flash with color filters, and B+ Instant, as well as a multiple exposure option, and a tripod socket.  It’s a small camera that encourages experimentation, as it comes with a close-up lens, multi-faceted “kaleidoscopic” lens, and a Lomo “splitzer” attachment, that when used under the multi-exposure option, allows for different sections of the frame to be exposed separately.  It uses 1 AA cell for the flash, which can be turned off when shooting the camera in daylight. After I received my Apparat kit from KEH, I carefully went over everything, and for one, Lomography does a great job packaging their products, making them inviting to open and examine.  Like many of their cameras, the Apparat has a paperback book accompanying it with photos that really showcase the camera’s results,  projected with that fun Lomo “shoot from the hip” ethos.  Camera specifications:Film- 35mm film Shutter- 1/100 sec, plus B and multiple exposureLens- 21mm f/10 Tripod socket: yesViewfinder- almost centered, with view approximating the lens coverageFlash- uses 1 AA battery, with ND  and multiple colored gels placed in pop-up holderFilm advance - manual, with thumbwheelFilm rewind - manual, no detensioning neededFilm door - clear film reminder window, storage slot for the color flash gelsAt first glance, the Apparat resembles on of the many iterations of Kodak 126 Instamatic cameras, except for the obviously large front element and lens hood.  It is definitely more robust than the RETO Ultra-Wide and Slim with the 22mm lens, and has more features.  The included metal wrist strip is quite nice, and complements the black plastic camera body.In use:  While the Apparat is pretty easy to figure out, I do like the fact that the front switch with B, N, and OFF is easy to see, and when in OFF position, blocks the viewfinder and locks the shutter release.  That’s a welcome feature for any simple-use camera.  In addition, pressing the lower lighted switch beneath the flash turns the flash off/on - also a welcome feature.  My only real complaint is that the thumbwheel film advance is hard to turn as it does not protrude very far from the back.  Also, there is no button to depress to rewind the film. You just turn the rewind lever to pull the film back into the cassette.  I really like the lens hood and the nice secure fit of the lens cap.  I have not yet tried the accessory lenses.  I shot a roll of Fujifilm Superia 200 in late October - mostly while on a trip to Dutchess Co., NY.  I had the film processed at my local camera store, Ball Photo in Asheville, NC.   I scanned the negatives with my Epson V700, and did some post-scan correction.  Overall, I was happy with my results.  The Apparat is a very simple camera, and I didn’t have high expectations for the results, but I liked what I did get from it.  It’s definitely a step above the typical simple-use cameras that have recently appeared on the market, and it has some features that no other cameras in its class offer.  The images are fairly sharp at center, with some blur towards the edges of the frame, and I don’t think that the wide-angle distortion is really noticeable.  You can be as close as about 1 foot from your subject, and if you use the flash, you can use the neutral density filter gel if you are really close so that the flash doesn’t wash out the image.  Unless you are out on a bright sunny day at the beach, I recommend using ISO 200 or 400 film.  In cloudy weather, 400 ISO film should definitely be used.  I have yet to try the Apparat with b&w film, and look forward to doing so.Is the Apparat for you?  It’s a bit lo-fi, but it feels secure in the hands and has a great wide-angle view that is better than any other simple-use camera.  It has options to encourage experimentation at a relatively low price.  It’s not as fragile as other simple use cameras, and it is fun to use.  I know that people will complain about the B option and no cable release, but if it’s on a solid tripod, there is not going to be much in the way of camera shake.  And because it does have a B setting, once could use it with low-ISO film, tripod, and guesstimation for the exposure.  You could use Lomo’s Babylon (ISO 13) or Fantome (ISO 8), and in full sun, a 1 second B exposure should be fine, with longer exposures accordingly for other conditions.Here are some images from my first roll with the Apparat."},
{"title": "Appreciating a Classic Lens -  Nikon’s 50mm f/2 Nikkor-H ", "date": "Saturday, November 11, 2023", "text": "My Nikon FE with a factory AI'd Nikkor-HOver the years, I have had lenses come and go in my “toolkit” and some lenses become favorites for a time, to be replaced by another another focal length that fits my photographic practice.  Early on, it was always a 50mm lens of some sort on whatever camera body  you can imagine, and I have used an awful lot of different “normal” lenses.  In the Nikon ecosystem, there have been 50mm f/2, f/1.8, f/1.4 and f/1.2 lenses.  While I love the 50mm f/1.4 for a lot of things, the old, old, Nikkor-H 50mm f/2 has been around for the Nikon SLR since day 1, and it’s a lens that I know will always render a scene very well. Sure, it’s not the fastest of the bunch, but as a do-it-all 50, it’s at the top. Why?  Above - the front and rear of an early non-AI 50mm Nikkor-H. This one lacks the rear of the lens held in place by 5 screws, meaning that it cannot be factory-adapted to the more modern AI mount.For one, it’s one of those lenses that has had many iterations as technology and camera bodies improved.  The original 5 cm Nikkor-S  came out in 1959, and it was a 7 element lens with 4 groups.   In 1964, the lens was changed to a 6 element lens with 4 groups, and renamed the 50mm Nikkor-H.  That lens became the sort of de-facto normal lens for many years, until 1974, when Nikon replaced the silver and black barrel with the 50mm f/2, an all-black barreled lens with a rubberized focus ring.  In 1977, the AI (auto-indexing) 50mm f/2 came out to be included with the Nikon FE, FM, Nikkormat EL2 and FT3, all of which were no longer required to use the old non-AI f/5.6 “double twist” to set the maximum aperture for the metering system.  The Nikon 50mm f/2 was dropped in 1979, and replaced in the lineup with the 50mm f/1.8, which has also had a number of iterations, but I won’t delve into them.Above - The last iteration of the 50mm f/2 with an AI-mount.Second, the 50mm f/2 has a very flat field with little distortion.  Perhaps that’s partly due to the f/2 maximum aperture, but in my experience, it’s sharp at all apertures, but especially so at f/5.6-f/16.  I’ve used it to copy documents on a copy stand, as a macro-lens with a bellows, and of course, general photography.  The lens was briefly given the H.C designation in 1972, to indicate improved coating surfaces.  For more information, see this account on the Nikon site. Real-world tests, not the sharpness of brick walls, indicate how a lens performs.  Lately, I have been using a 50mm Nikkor-H that was Nikon modified to be an AI-mount.  I don’t exactly remember when I started using it - probably last fall, but I have come to appreciate its performance with my Nikon FE, F3HP, and FM3A bodies.  In the past few months, I have been using the lens on my Nikon FE with various color films, and am really pleased with the results.  Is it any different than the last AI version of the 50mm f/2?  Probably not, but I love the classic look of the lens, and the knurled focus ring feels right.Last and earlier versions of the 50mm f/2. The lens on the right was factory modified to be an AI lens.Today, 50mm seems to be out in favor of expensive zooms, or, wide-aperture prime lenses.  I’ve certainly used  the 50mm f/1.2 Nikkor, and it has a special use for low-light or really shallow depth of field situations.  Overall though, as an all-purpose normal lens, the 50mm f/2 is one of the best lenses you can own.  The Leitz and Zeiss fanboys will probably disagree, but price-wise, you’ll not find a better 50mm lens.  It’s an SLR  lens that’s been around for over 60 years, and untold thousands have been used by photographers in all sorts of situations.  On a full-frame body such as my Nikon Df, or on a Nikon F or FM3a, the results will be excellent.  The AF equivalent would be the 50mm f/1.8 AF-D Nikkor, which is a pretty common lens and often overlooked in favor of the faster f/1.4.  However, with higher ISO settings on a DSLR, the f/1.8 aperture is not limiting.  Old with the new The lenses one decides to use should be based on how they perform in the types of photography that you do.  Some times a prime lens or a set of them will be all one needs for a majority of his/her photography, and other times a zoom lens in a certain range fulfills one’s requirements.  While I have my share of zoom lenses in manual and auto-focus versions, I find myself using prime lenses most of the time.  There’s a lot to be said for using a single lens for many situations, and one photographer’s choice of say, a 24mm lens for many situations will result in quite different compositions than another photographer’s choice of 50mm, or 85mm.  You can “zoom” with your feet, if necessary, like many did when all you could afford was a single lens — the one that came with your camera, and it was most likely a 50mm prime lens.  The Nikkormat FTN and 50mm f/2 Nikkor-HA perfect match!As I posted previously, I find that a 35mm lens is perfect for when I am on the street or traveling.  Often, I find myself packing one Nikon body with the 35mm f/2 and black and white film, and another Nikon body with color film and the 50mm f/2, and a 24mm and 85mm in the bag.  Those pretty much cover my needs for a lot of what I shoot, and that many decades old 50mm Nikkor-H f/2 has never disappointed me.The more modern 50mm f/1.8 is a tad faster than the f/2, and is capable of slightlycloser focus. It's also an excellent normal lens.My factory AI'd Nikkor-H has slotted screws on the back, vs thePhillips screws on later versions. Those knurled sections are verysatisfying to the touch.A few very recent results from that 50mm f/2 Nikkor-H with the Nikon FE and various color films.Wassaic, NY.

{"title": " Kodak 2238 and a Rollei 35 TE", "date": "Tuesday, October 17, 2023", "text": "I first reviewed Kodak 2238 in 2017, and shot it under winter conditions, where the contrast was already quite high.  Also known as Kodak Panchromatic Separation Film for use in the cine world, it’s a low ISO film that’s rated at 12-25 ISO, and does not require a special low-contrast developer to get a proper negative.  That’s what I like about it, since D-76 and D-96 are my favorite developers.  But the other thing I like about 2238 is it’s ultra-fine grain - nearly grainless, and the way it renders landscape scenes.  I loaded a roll into my Rollei 35 TE, which I’ve owned for well over 20 years.  The Tessar lens in that Rollei 35TE is sharp as can be, perfectly suited for a high-definition film like 2238.Since 2238 is shot at ISO 25, I limited use to daylight photographs, as my Rollei 35 TE shutter no longer operates at speeds below 1/15 sec.  That’s due to the way these cameras are typically stored - with the shutter cocked and the lens retracted into the body.  Long-term storage like that causes the loss of the slow shutter speeds.  I shot most of the roll of 2238 on a trip to Ludington State Park, Michigan, in mid-September.  It’s a great little camera to keep in my camera shoulder bag, as it takes up very little space, and I have always had great results from it.  While it does need a battery for the meter, I rarely use the meter, and just go with an external meter of sunny-16 estimates.    Ludington State Park is on the Lake Michigan shoreline about half-way up the west coast of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. There are lots of sand dunes, inter-dunal ponds and wetlands, as well as Big Sable Point light house at the northern end of the park.  So, it has great lakeshore access as well as a nice road/trail that runs N to the lighthouse.  I mostly shot that day with my Nikon F3HP, but the trusty little Rollei 35 came out towards the end of my day of shooting. The film was developed in FPP D-96 for 12 minutes, and the results were what I expected.  It turns out that the roll of 2238 had been loaded nearly a year prior, when I was in Lexington, VA.  That’s what happens when there’s a small camera in my bag — it sometimes can take a year to shoot with it.  Here are a few shots from that roll, all scanned on my Epson V700.my favorite of the seriesI encourage you to try some of these oddball films like Kodak 2238.  They are not what I’d call general-use films, since they are very slow.  But, for detail-rich landscapes, architecture, and a different take on portraiture, they can yield great results depending on the lens and the lighting.  Another good choice for slow films is Rollei RPX 25, which is readily available and can be easily developed."},
{"title": " PANOZINE -  for Panoramas", "date": "Sunday, October 15, 2023", "text": "I’ve been thinking for a long time about publishing a zine dedicated solely to panoramic film images.  The first iteration in a way, was the Monochrome Mania issue No. 9 featuring the works of 4 photographers using the Ansco Pix Panorama camera.  Instead of being a typical portrait 8.5 x 11” format, I switched the layout to landscape format, so that the page was 11” long and 8.5” high.  It worked well, but there was a lot of white space, which in the presentation of Monochrome Mania, is quite okay.  However, I didn’t feel that it was the best way to convey the panoramic idea on the page.  It would have been even better to have a page 11 or 14” long and about half the height.  I started looking at the page layout offerings of my printer (Mixam) and found that they have a 4 1/4 by 11” print size.  That could work.  So, after developing the negatives from my Sprocket Rocket from my mid-September trip to Michigan, I immediately started working on the first issue in the new format, and PANOZINE was born.I feel pretty lucky to be able to afford to have a zine printed and then be able to sell it, and with Monochrome Mania already established as a three-issues/year zine, I have a ready audience for any new venture.  At least I hope so. My plan is to sporadically publish PANOZINE, with each issue featuring the results from a particular camera.  I also would like to be able to print in color, as well as feature other photographers.  I’m not yet sure how I’ll do that, as I don’t want a situation where I get a hundred submissions from random people for a single issue.  Given that panos are not something that everyone does, and fewer do well, I think the opportunity to present other photographers’ work could be quite interesting.  I can envision issues either featuring a certain camera or a theme as being something that could work.   I will probably do what I did for the Ansco Pix MM issue, and invite photographers that have already produced quality panoramic images.This first issue of PANOZINE features images from my Lomography Sprocket Rocket, a camera that certainly has a distinct look, and provides pretty good results within in its capabilities.   My camera has a bit of history, as I bought it from Trish Korous in Chicago, back in early 2017.  I have been using the camera every so often, and when I see my negatives, I usually wonder why I don’t shoot with it more than I do.  Anyhow, after my September Michigan trip, I realized that I had enough shots with it to put together at least a proof-of-concept zine with the name I had stored away in my head - PANOZINE, which of course, sounds a bit like some Italian dish.  My run of this initial issue is 60 copies, as I am not quite sure how the sales will be. If you are interested in a copy, it’s 32 pages with covers, in b&w, and the cost is $7.00 + your state tax and $1.50 for shipping via first class mail.  I am selling only in the USA at this point. You can order it from my Etsy store.So, perhaps you’ll see color and more pages in future issues, but I guess that depends on how well this first attempt sells.  I do have high hopes for this venture, though. It’s certainly been a really fun zine to put together, with minimal text and one photograph/page.  If you have purchased a copy and are reading this, I would definitely appreciate any feedback."},
{"title": "The Simple Plastic Camera", "date": "Thursday, October 05, 2023", "text": "Over the course of a couple of decades of photography, I’ve often extolled the virtues of simple plastic cameras, and with two issues of Monochrome Mania that dealt with medium-format and 35mm simple cameras, I guess I have promoted them as much as anyone can. That doesn’t mean that they are the best cameras, by any stretch of the imagination. But what they do well, is to offer a different image than something from a much better set of optics that are found in your \"real cameras.\"  I’ll never forgo using my Nikons or Spotmatics, Leica M2, or my Yashicamat, Pentax 6x7, etc. in favor of a simple plastic camera. However, that does not mean that I won’t carry one in a camera bag along with the pro gear. Michael Kenna, a fantastic photographer that has mostly used Hasselblads, published a wonderful book of Holga-based photographs which I wrote about several years ago.  It’s often dependent on a situation where one can use a simple plastic camera (toy camera, crappy camera, etc.) in a way that complements your other cameras. In fact, there have been times when a Holga image from my travels captured a place and time far better than any more complex camera could have. Part of that is knowing the best situation for simple cameras, and knowing that the exposure falls within the capabilities of the camera. In the past few years, we have been inundated with new plastic 35mm cameras that are reusable, and generally have the same specifications - a 35 mm focal length lens with an aperture of f/8 or f/11, and a single shutter speed of about 1/100 sec.  All have a flash, and that’s pretty much it for control.  We all know that those small acrylic lenses are actually pretty good, because the single-use cameras have been using them for years. I’m not saying they are better than my 35mm f/2 Nikkor, which they are not.  But they have a specific character that I find endearing - sharp at the center, but no so much at the edges.  These cameras also weigh nearly nothing and are compact.  So, adding one of them into your camera bag or jacket pocket isn’t a big deal. I recently finished up a roll of film in my Dubble SHOW camera.  It had been bouncing around from bag to bag for over a year, and it had a roll of Fujifilm Superia 200 loaded the whole time.  It’s obvious that I didn’t shoot with it a lot, but when I had the film developed I was surprised at how long it had been loaded with the same roll of film. I had shot the last half of the roll when I was in downtown Asheville, and had already shot the film that was in my Leica M2 and Spotmatic, and rather than reload them, I just shot with the Dubble camera on my way back to my car.  I’d forgotten even what film stock was in it.  I was quite pleased to see the negatives, and the Superia 200 has a very good latitude of exposure.  What pleased me the most though, was that the scanned images had saturated tones and just enough loss of detail, that they demonstrated that sharpness does not matter nearly as much as composition and subject matter.It’s certainly possible that one could use one of these little plastic cameras for a lot pf photographic projects and come away with some memorable images. Yeah, I know it’s not the camera, but the photographer, but if you work within the parameters of the camera’s best scenario of exposure, you will come away with better images.  A lot of people trying film for the first time will pick one of these simple cameras and then wonder why their photos look like crap.  Most of the time, it’s because they don’t understand exposure or understand light.  These cameras will do fine if in perfect (for them) conditions, and loaded with any film of ISO 200-400.  After all, they are basically nothing more than 35mm box cameras.But whoa, if these cameras are just cheap little plastic box cameras, why am I recommending one?  As I said in the beginning, put one in your bag with your better gear.  You may find that perfect moment when using one makes sense.  It’s not about the megapixels, it’s not about perfect sharpness and great detail - it’s about emotion, sense of place, and the unsharpness of memory. I’ve used toy cameras for 20+ years, and whether it’s a 35mm Holga, a Vivitar T101, a Reto Ultrawide and Slim, or the latest Kodak/Harman/Ansco/Reto /Dubble 35mm camera, you’ll find that having one (or even two)  in your camera bag will afford you the opportunity to exercise some creativity and even freedom to try something different. If you are curious about what 35mm simple plastic cameras are available, get a copy of Monochrome Mania Number 7 - The Magic and Allure of Toy Cameras, Vol. 2 - 35mm. It’s a steal at $10.Someone’s going to ask - \"How do I know what are the right conditions?\"  Learn about exposure as it relates to ISO - film sensitivity to light, aperture, and shutter speed.  If your plastic camera is the Harman simple use camera or the Dubblefilm SHOW - it has a 32mm f/8 lens with a 1/100 sec shutter speed. On a day in full sun with ISO 100 film, it will slightly overexpose the film (should be f/11 or f/16) with that combination.  Overexposing a bit is not a problem with b&w and color negative films.  On on cloudy bright day, it should still be good.  Not so good in shade or overcast conditions, though.  Under overcast conditions, ISO 400 film would be a better choice.  Indoors, you’d need to use the built-in flash for subjects no farther than 12 feet away.   The specifications for the other cameras introduced in the past few years are going to be similar.  In most cases, if you use a 200 ISO black and white or color film, you will be pleased with the results with outdoor photographs on sunny to partly cloudy days.  I highly recommend David Mihaly’s \"The Old Camera Guy\" YouTube videos where he uses simple plastic cameras.  They’ll give you a good idea of the type of results you can expect.  Unless your camera has a Bulb mode for long exposures, stay away from any film that has an ISO lower than 100. ISO 200 film is the sweet spot for most of these cameras.Photography should be fun, and while one should be attentive to the proper techniques for the best results, sometimes it doesn’t hurt to take a chance and let that imprecise 35mm plastic camera do its magic."},
{"title": "One Roll Review - Svema MZ3", "date": "Saturday, September 23, 2023", "text": "image courtesy of the Film Photography ProjectIt’s been a few years since I have shot with this film that’s available from the Film Photography Project store. I kept putting off shooting with it until I had a little project.  I decided to put a roll in my camera bag for my trip up to Ludington, MI last week. I knew that I’d have the opportunity to photograph in the dunes near Lake Michigan, so what better use for this ultra-low ISO film?What is MZ3?Like several other film stocks available from the FPP store, Svema is the manufacturer of MZ3. It’s an extremely fine-grained blue-sensitive (orthochromatic) film with an ISO of 3. It lacks an anti-halation layer, and the polyester film base is subject to light-piping. Light piping is when the light hitting the exposed film leader is carried by the film base farther into the canister. Usually, it mostly results in some exposure around the sprocket holes, but in severe cases, it can fog the first few frames. Therefore, MZ3 is one of those films that should be loaded either indoors or in the shade, and ought to be stored in opaque film canisters until used. Those new aluminum film cans that I see with some third-party film reloads would be ideal.Since the MZ3 film is so slow, it’s going to be ideal for landscape, architecture, etc. However, with a fast lens of f/2, one could shoot handheld wide-open on a sunny day. Using sunny-16 as a guide, f/16 in full sun would be about 1/3 of a sec exposure.  The equivalent at f/4 would be 1/30 to 1/60 sec. Years ago, I shot MZ3 with a ND filter to get really long exposures at a busy area in Ann Arbor. Tripod-mounted, of course. I loaded the MZ3 into my trusty Nikon F3HP, which I consider to be one of Nikon’s best film SLRs. For me, it’s a great photographic tool that’s never let me down. I used manual exposure and an external light meter to make the photographs on this roll. I also used a tripod, since I was generally shooting at f/16. The ISO dial on the F3 only goes down to ISO 12, and at that setting, the exposure compensation dial only allows about +1.3 stops. So, manual exposure it was. If memory serves correct, most of my shots were around 1/8 sec.After I returned home, I developed the MZ3 in HC110 dilution H for 9 minutes and 15 seconds. That gave me quite good tonality. Since this is a blue sensitive film, greens are quite dark, providing a lot of contrast between the sand and the vegetation.light piping along the film rebate at the beginning of the rollHere are some examples from that roll. Overall, I quite like the results, though some images needed more post-processing than I expected. That’s the fun aspect of these low-ISO oddball films - they are not going to be boring, that’s for sure. I highly recommend that you try this film - and since it does not require special developers to achieve good results, it’s a good choice for a really low-iso film experience.  The MZ3 definitely gave me a look quite different from a 100 ISO panchromatic film."},
{"title": " Photographic Echoes", "date": "Thursday, September 07, 2023", "text": "Did you ever visit a place, take some photos, and then only later realize the significance of that place in regards to another photographer’s body of work?  It’s not like going to, say, Yosemite, fully aware of Ansel Adams’ photographic legacy.  Nor is it like going to New York City, that has been the subject of many photographers.  How about a “small town”?  First, a little back story.  I have been slowly working on a project about US-23, aka “The Dixie Highway” that stretches from the tip of the lower peninsula of Michigan, through Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and ends in Jacksonville, FL.  I’ve done a fair amount of photography along the way, especially in Michigan and Ohio.  I’ve yet to finish the route from NC to FL. Yet, US-23 runs not far past my house in NC, where it shares the road with I-26 and US-19, so I’m always aware of that unfinished journey.Hopefully, a project that I'll finishThis past April, I was traveling from a photo gathering in Cleveland back to my home in Weaverville, so I took US-23south, and stopped in Portsmouth, Ohio, which I had been through before.  This time, I stopped to walk around and do some photography - with some examples, as seen below.  It’s obvious that Portsmouth was once a more robust place that had fallen on hard times, but is rebounding now, typical of a lot of previous industrial towns along the Ohio River and in the so-called rust belt.  I’ve been through a few of them, and while some will probably not escape more decline, others will persevere and improve.  Portsmouth seems to be in the “improving” stage, and is also positioned in a place where hiking, boating, and other outdoor activities will attract people.  As I walked around with my camera, it was obvious that towns like Portsmouth have a lot of history, and my feeble attempt with a camera for a few hours was not going to be enough to reveal much of it.  If anything, the flood wall with the murals on the city side was ample evidence of a storied past.  Just as the flood wall is also evidence of the existential threat of the mighty Ohio, it’s also a reminder that people have overcome many obstacles to create a community.Something nagged at me though, as if I had read something about Portsmouth or a town along the Ohio River before.  Last week, I realized what that was.  Mary Ellen Mark’s photographs in Life Magazine in September, 1989. “Growing Up at 215 Washington Street, Portsmouth, Ohio.”  I had taken photos of that article with my cell phone when I was visiting my wife’s family in Amenia, NY in 2016.  The text, written by Peter Meyer, is direct, unflinching, and a damning indictment of a country that was ruined by Reaganomics during the 1980s.   It’s always the kids that suffer.   The fact that it was someplace in the middle of the country, and a white family possibly made it connect more to the readers.  Had it been a Black family, would there have been anything other than the usual put-downs by the readers?  This excerpt encapsulates the point of the story:“The children of 215 Washington Street—Chuck, Mike, Jenifer and Tiffany; Carrie, Mike, Jeff and Jamie—are not alone. At last count 13 million American children were growing up poor—one in every five. Since 1969 child poverty rates have risen from 14 to 20 percent, adding three million more youngsters—enough to populate a city the size of Chicago. From the children at 215, we can get an idea of what it is like to grow up poor in America in 1989. Like most American poor children, they are white, they do not live in a metropolitan area, their parents don't own a house, and their family's income is less than what the federal government says is necessary to survive.”The 1989 article in Life1989 Life articleThe old tenement 215 Washington Street is now gone, and that series of lots, once nothing but grass, is now seeing rebuilding going on.  I checked through Google maps for previous years, and I suspect that the crappy old apartment building was torn down in the 1990s.  I found this really good article from Ohio Humanities dated 2022, that has some good commentary about that 1989 Life article.  Amanda Page offers up her recollection, and it’s a very important follow up.2022 Google Maps View of 215 Washington St2019 View of 215 Washington StMary Ellen Mark was an astute photographer, and she exposed the plights of the poor and disenfranchised, especially women.  Her photographs for this article are echoes of Walker Evans’ images of the sharecroppers and their families in Hale Co., Alabama.  So, I guess this story has several echoes, not just one.After reading that story again, I have to wonder how those kids turned out.   1989 wasn’t that long ago.  Just 34 years."},
{"title": " One Roll Review - Lomochrome Color '92", "date": "Monday, August 28, 2023", "text": "I have to hand it to the minds at Lomography. Whatever sources they have, or partnerships with film manufacturers, they have been able to come up with some films that simply defy convention and encourage experimentation by photographers.  I'm not sure where this latest release stands in the world of C-41 films that Lomography has come up with, but when I saw it available, I purchased three rolls from the Lomography store.  First of all, I knew that I wanted to test this film in a camera that has shown reliable results with color films, my Yashica Electro 35CC. With its 35mm f/1.8 lens, this camera is considerably more compact than the big Yashica Electro 35s most people are familiar with.  That's one reason that I use it, and the other is that I like the aperture-priority operation of this camera (even if I don't know what the exact shutter speed will be), and the 35mm lens is perfect for much of the photography that I do.I already had a roll of Kodak Pro Image 100 in this camera, which was fortuitous, since I could compare the color rendition of the Color '92 with the Pro Image 100.  I shot the roll of Color '92 in Murphy and Asheville, NC.  I shot it at the box speed of ISO 400, and it was developed by Ball Photo in Asheville, and I scanned the negatives on my Epson V700 scanner. Minor corrections were applied post-scan in Corel Paintshop Pro.The Henn theatre, shot on Pro Image 100Henn Theatre, shot on Color '92As you can see, the Color'92 has a bit of a slightly different palette, but nothing like the Lomo Metropolis film.  If anything, it reminds me of some older slide film scans, but with better shadow detail.    In the two photos of the Henn theater in Murphy, NC, the red looks slightly muted compared to the Pro Image 100, but blues are more intense.Some more images:The rest are from Asheville, NCBased on this sample, I'd say that the reds have some cyan that mutes them a bit, and that the film really shines in full sun.   Overall, it's certainly a choice on whether to use it or any other 400 ISO color film.  It's not going to be as obvious a result as say, Lomo Metropolis or Lomochrome Purple. However, I do like the look of this filmIs it worth the extra price over some expired 400 ISO film?  It all depends on what you are looking for. I think the more muted appearance in shade is quite nice."},
{"title": " One Roll Review - SHD 100 Pro", "date": "Wednesday, August 23, 2023", "text": "Last month, I stopped into my local photography store - Ball Photo, in Asheville, NC.  I bought a few rolls of film that I hadn’t seen before, and one of them was SHD Pro 100.  I was a little surprised, as I thought that Lucky film in China had disappeared from the scene, so I was certainly curious and eager to try this film.The box containing the film has an expiration date of October 2023. While there is no mention of the Lucky brand on the box, the web site for the film is www.yangziyicn.com - which took me to a Facebook page.  However, the film is available online at the Reflx Lab website at $5.99/roll, and the information from Reflx Lab states the following:“The SHD 100 film stock is using the emulsion formula from the time-honored Chinese brand Lucky Film.”Well, it was many, many years ago that I shot with Lucky film, and if I recall correctly, it suffered a bit from halation.  Not a bad thing, if that’s what you want. Well, what the hell.  I loaded the roll into my Leica M2, and shot the roll on a sunny afternoon along the French Broad River N of Asheville.  I used my Doomo light meter that I keep on my M2.  The box actually has development times for D-76 and HC-110 printed on one of the flaps. The film cassette is one of those plastic two-piece units that Lomography’s been using.  There is also a separate DX code sticker to go over the paper label if your camera requires DX codes to set the ISO to 100.  I developed the film in D76 1:1 at 20°C for 11 minutes, rinsed in water for the stop, and fixed for 7 minutes. A couple of observations right away - the film is on a triacetate base and lies flat when dry- which makes it easy to scan on my Epson V700 flatbed.  The sprocket holes don’t seem to be die cut nearly as smooth as other films — maybe it’s the thicker film base, but it’s just an appearance, not something tactile.  The film is fine-grained and damn, I love it.  I am very happy with the results from this first roll. I did not see any halation problems or artifacts.  I like it so much that I ordered 5 rolls (each roll is 36 exposures) directly from the Reflx Lab web site.Here are some sample images from this first roll."},
{"title": "Among The Trees - My latest issue of Monochrome Mania", "date": "Friday, August 04, 2023", "text": "I've been publishing Monochrome Mania since January 2020, and every issue has had a different focus.  My latest, Among The Trees, is the 11th issue, and I've put a lot of thought into it.  First of all, I limited it to images made since 2018, which certainly made choosing the photographs a lot easier, and not having to go back over 20 years for source material. Secondly, most of the images have been made within an hour of where I live in NC, with a few from SC.  Among The Trees is a personal journey, but I also hope that it resonates with others that find the forest to be a place of solace, inspiration, and enjoyment.  Putting this issue together has been sort of an ongoing project with different starts and then set aside. I realized that I had to narrow my focus to recent material, because I've been so inspired by the forests here.  Once I narrowed it down, the writing became easier, and more personal in nature.  I grew up at the edge of the Adirondacks in northern NY, and the woods were my playground when I was a kid.  I hunted and fished there when I was older, and went to the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry for my B.S. and M.S.  In short, I've been a naturalist for a good part of my life, and in moving to NC, my affinity for the mountains and the forests has tapped into a reservoir of knowledge and the marvels of the area.  A walk on a forest path quickly sharpens my perception, lowers my blood pressure, and I become more attuned to my surroundings.  That immersive experience is a central tenet of the zine,  Almost all the images in this issue were shot on film, and I provide the information for each at the back of the issue, as well as selected references that are mentioned in the text.  My choice of films were primarily Kentmere 100/400, and Fomapan 100/400.  The Derevpan 100 also gets some use.  The cameras were largely Nikons and Spotmatics for 35mm;  Hasselblad, Lomo LCA 120, Yashicamat 124, Agfa Isolette and Pentax 6x7 for medium format.  I really enjoy living in Western NC, and living close to the Blue Ridge Parkway certainly has its advantages.  I had so much source material from the past 4 years, that I may end up doing some new zines and just call the Among The Trees or something like that. Here are a few samples from this issue:Among The Trees is 8.5 x 11 inches, 36 pages plus covers.  It's available at my Etsy store (link in sidebar), as well as at Ball Photo in Asheville, NC.  A direct link to the zine is here. The price is $10+ shipping.  I'll leave you with a few images that didn't make the issue..."},
{"title": " Retro Digital - The Nikon Coolpix 5000", "date": "Wednesday, August 02, 2023", "text": "The E995 - 3.2 MP system cameraHiyotada, CC BY-SA 3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0>, via Wikimedia CommonsBack at the turn of the millenium, Nikon wowed us with the Coolpix 950  (E950) - a nearly 2 megapixel digital camera with an unmistakable twist - the body swiveled to provide the user with a more stable handling, while the lens section was pointed at the subject.  That was not the first appearance, though. The swiveling body was introduced a year earlier (1998) in the Coolpix 900, a 1.2 MP camera.  To be fair— at the time, such a revolutionary design was quite a departure from the digicams that had been appearing on the market.  Anyone that was a serious photographer scoffed at the 1.2 MP toy that Nikon had introduced.  Well, a year later, the 950 appeared with improved features and because it was a NIKON, it should be taken seriously.  Then in 2000, the Coolpix 990 (E990) appeared with a 3.2 MP sensor, more improvements, as well as a suite of attachments and accessory lenses.  Nikon sought to capture the advanced photographer that wanted a decent digital camera, and the only other option at the time was the D1, a monster of a camera that was weighty, slow, and too expensive for most of us.  The Coolpix addressed a different audience, and the Coolpix 990 camera became quite popular. With a price of about $900, it offered a slew of features that a lot of the competition just didn’t have.  Not to be outdone by competitors, Nikon released the Coolpix 995 (E995) in 2001, and while still with a 3.2 MP sensor, it incorporated a number of improvements, including the use of an EN-EL-1 rechargeable battery.  Part of the attraction of the Coolpix 9XX series was the 28mm filter ring on the lens, which allowed the continued use of attachments that were not obsoleted by a newer model.  Nikon’s use of accessory lenses, filters, and flash attachments was far better than other manufacturers at the time, and the Coolpix 995 was considered to be a serious digital camera. At about $900, it was significantly cheaper than the Nikon D1, which sold for $5500.  It was not until 2002 that the 6 MP D100 DLSR was introduced, with a price tag about double the Coolpix 995.  I used a Coolpix 990 and 995 quite a bit in 2002-2007 in my work at the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan.  The camera was really good for a lot of close-up photography  and with the ES-28 Slide and film copying adapter, I used it extensively for quickly digitizing hundreds of 35mm slides. The ability to use an external flash was a tremendous advantage, as it allowed me to use my Nikon Speedlights  for better flash photography than you would get with the pop-up flash on the E995 body.   In short, the Coolpix 900-series ecosystem offered a serious user a lot of options via the accessory lenses and adapters.  I’ll discus those things a bit later.Some examples from the E990 and E995:My old darkroom with the wide-angle adapterThe E990 with off-camera flashE995 with off-camera flashE995 with off-camera flashOver the past few years, I have come across a lot of the accessory lenses, such as the fisheye and teleconverter, as well as the ES-25 slide copier.  They have sat in a box, and one day I found an adapter that I had not seen before.  It was to use the 28mm accessories for the Coolpix 900 series on a Coolpix 5000.  What? What was the Coolpix 5000?  After some research, I found that the Coolpix 5000 had some similar features of the 995,  but it was a rigid body with a 5 MP sensor.  Hmmm.  I really didn’t want to find a used E995 with only 3.2 MP, I wanted the E5000 with 5 MP!  A quick search on eBay brought numerous E5000 cameras, but one offering looked great - and for $14 + shipping I got a like-new E5000 in the original box with all the chargers, connectors, manuals, and CD that it came with.  About the Coolpix 5000 cameraThe Coolpix 5000 was introduced in November 2001 at the price of $1099.00. It retained use of all the 28mm accessories with a UR-E5 adapter, which is a big deal for those who had invested heavily in the E900 series accessories.  The body of the camera is Magnesium alloy, giving it a very durable and comfortable feel.  The rear LCD screen - which is minuscule by today’s standards - and very similar to the rear LCD on the E995 - pops out away from the body and can be rotated in various directions.  You can use the optical viewfinder in lieu of the LCD, and save battery power, as well as for ease of use. The lens has the focal length equal to a 28-85mm zoom on a full-frame camera, with maximum apertures from f/2.8 - 4.8.  Camera specs:•Sensor- 2/3” (5.24 megapixel total)•Image sizes-  2560 x 1920, 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960, 1024 x 768, 640 x 480•Image formats-  TIFF, JPEG, MOV (movie clips)•Aspect ratio- 4:3 / 3:2 (2560 x 1700)•Lens- Nikkor 3x optical zoom, 28 - 85 mm (as 35mm equiv.)•Lens max. aperture- F2.8 - F4.8•Digital Zoom-  x1.2 - x4.0 in x0.2 steps•Auto Focus-  Contrast Detect,  5-Area Multi AF or Spot AF selectable•Focus modes-  Continuous AF, Single AF, Manual•Focus range- Normal: 50 cm - Infinity, Macro: 2 cm - Infinity •Metering - 256-segment Matrix. -center weighted average, spot, spot AF area•Shutter speeds - Bulb (max 5 mins), 8 sec - 1/4,000 sec•Apertures- Wide: F2.8, F3.1, F3.5, F4.0, F4.4, F5.0, F5.6, F6.3, F7.1, F8.0•Tele: F4.8, F5.4, F6.0, F6.8, F7.6•Exposure control-  Program Auto (with flexible program), Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, Manual•Exposure compensation- +/-2 EV in 0.3 EV steps•Auto exposure bracket -  3 or 5 frames within +/-2.0 EV•Sensitivity-  Auto, ISO 100-800•White balance- Matrix Auto White Balance, Incandescent, Fluorescent, Cloudy, Flash, Preset, White bal. bracket•Viewfinder- Optical type (with diopter adjustment)•LCD monitor- 1.8\" 110,000 pixel TFT, Flip-out and twist type•Storage- Compact Flash Type I or II•Shooting modes-  Auto, CSM #1 - #3 (three custom mode memories)•Capture modes- Single, Continuous H (3 fps, max 3 images), Continuous L (1.5 fps, max 10 frames), High-speed Continuous (SXGA, XGA, VGA;

{"title": "The new, stylish Reflx Lab Light Meter", "date": "Wednesday, July 19, 2023", "text": "Last month, I received a nice little package from Reflx Lab.  In it, was a sample of their new accessory light meter for me to evaluate.  Over the course of several weeks, I kept the meter on my black-bodied Pentax Spotmatic SP, and used it to shoot three rolls of film.  In the past 4 years or so, a lot of small shoe-mounted light meters have come on the market.  In 2021 I reviewed the Doomo-D analog-style meter and in 2022, the tiny Cooldark V102 light meter.   I love this little meter - it’s simple to use, and once you go to the Reflx Lab web site, you can find the instructions for the meter (a QR code is on the meter’s package).  Unlike some of the other tiny meters available, this one has a beautiful aluminum shell, not a rough 3D printed plastic body.  Aesthetically, it’s one of the sleekest and most unobtrusive shoe-mounted meters available. I like the easy to read LCD readout, and there’s not much fussing about involved to get a reading. Power-wise, it takes a CR1632 3v button cell, which came with my meter.  In use, I especially enjoyed the larger and easy to read display over those tiny OLED displays.  Is it accurate?  Yes.  It has a 30-degree angle of metering, and when shooting and comparing the reading with an in-camera light meter, it usually agreed.  The ISO setting range is 8-6400, which ought to be enough for 95% of the users.  Since I often use really low-ISO films, I’d love it if the meter went as low as ISO 1.   However, I can do the math and compensate when using extra-low ISO film. When I am out shooting with my Spotmatic, I’m often inclined to use the sunny-16 rule, and then check what I think it should be with what the Reflx Lab meter tells me.  Those really hazy days that we have been experiencing can fool the eye, and what might normally be an f/16 sunny day has become an f/11 or f/8 sunny day.  The meter reads out either in Aperture-Priority or Shutter-Priority, which I find perfect for my use.  It’s ease of use and performance, makes it a go-to accessory meter.  The other great thing about this meter is the price — as it sells for less than $50.   The Reflx Lab Light Meter  is well-designed, accurate, easy-to-use, and inexpensive. All good things in my opinion.Specifications:Material: zinc, aluminum, & PC plasticColor: Black or SilverMetering Angle: 30-degree average meteringShoe bracket position: left, center, or right (adjustable)Dimensions: 35mm x 28mm x 11.5mm (1.4inch x 1.1inch x 0.45inch)Weight: 25g (0.88oz)Working Temperature: -12°C-60°CBattery: CR1632 x1 (NOT INCLUDED)ISO Range: 8-6400Shutter Range: 30s-1/8000sAperture Range: 1-32Exposure Compensation: -2 to +2You can download the manual here: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0608/4594/9094/files/REFLX_LAB_Light_Meter_User_Manual.pdf?v=1686927597If you are looking for a small, easy to use light meter that fits into the hot/cold shoe on your camera, give this one a try.  Check my post on the Reflx Lab Pro Color 100 film to see the outcome with using this meter."},
{"title": "The Kodak C300R - camera and mini-printer", "date": "Monday, July 10, 2023", "text": "About a month ago, I finally purchased a Kodak Minishot 3, 2 in 1 Retro Instant Digital Camera and Photo Printer - hereafter known as the C300R.  I bought it on Amazon with 6 cartridges of “film” for $130.  The main reason for the purchase is that the C300R is not only a camera with an instant printer, but it also functions as a Bluetooth-connected printer for my iPhone.  What better way to share photos with friends and family?  Also, I find using it to add images to my journal is very helpful.  Anyhow. now that I have had the C300R for a few weeks, I am impressed with the quality of the 3”x3” prints.  One could compare this to either a Polaroid mini or one of those zink (zero-ink) cameras/printers, but in terms of use - it’s certainly more like a little Polaroid camera. If you use it as a camera, it does not save an image to memory to be looked at later. The image stays in the buffer until you either print it, or take another shot. The print process is actually rather fun to watch as it’s a 4-pass process using a small dye-sublimation printer that does 3 passes for the CMY colors, and a final lamination layer that protects the surface of the print.  As you see in the short video, it takes about 60 seconds for that to happen, and you end up with a print that’s supposedly good for at least 100 years. The C300R isn’t exactly tiny, but it’s also not large. It’s 4” x 5” x 1.125” and can easily fit into a large pocket or your camera bag. It weighs about 14 ounces.  The tiny lens on the front has a selfie mirror nearby.  It’s use as an instant camera is pretty straightforward - just point and shoot, and press the print button on the back.  I didn’t expect the camera to produce jaw-dropping prints - but it really does a very good job with the prints - better than a Polaroid mini, for sure. Plus, you can add borders or effects to the image before you print it. A fun toy, for sure.The \"used\" YMC panels As a portable printer for your phone, you just need to download the Kodak Photo Printer app, connect to the C300R via Bluetooth, and then you select the images that you want to print.  Sharing could not be easier.  Since the prints are square, the best option is to take images on your phone in square format - which is what I normally do, anyway. You can do some cropping, etc in the app if necessary. It’s really a lot of fun to watch this printer work, and as each layer - Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, and Lamination takes place, it shows on your phone and the small LCD screen on the camera what’s taking place.A box has three cartridges of 10 shots eachEach pack of “film” is self-contained with the 10 sheets of paper and the roll of thin film with the sequence of dyes for each image. As they get used up, they get rolled onto a small cylinder in the cartridge. So in essence, you have a long series of yellow, magenta, cyan, and clear rectangles.  Each one has a component of the image that you printed.  I a bit of curiosity, I tool a used cartridge and unrolled the film from the take-up spool, and then tried to scan each of those layers separately to remake the image.  The thin film is really difficult to handle, and I also tried manually stacking the 3 color layers together and then photographed that, reversed the image in my image editor, and voila - a rather unsaturated and slightly misaligned image. Such a process could be something that has applications for people that are more creative than I am.  I did make a black and white image just from the Magenta layer, and it reminds me of the “negatives” from the peel-apart Land Camera film, FP3000B.manually layering the 3 colors on a light table,photographing it, then inverting to a positive.Just scanning the Magenta layer and converting to monochrome!The C300R has a built-in battery that’s charged by attaching a USB cable (Type B?) to any USB power source.  Each cassette holds materials for 10 shots/prints, and the cost per photo is about 60 cents - which is pretty cheap compared to a Polaroid or Instax camera.Overall, I think it’s a great device for anyone that would like to have an “instant” camera or a tiny portable printer. I don’t know how durable the C300R is over time, but like any digital device, it shouldn’t be abused. For the price, it’s pretty good value, and the supplies are not expensive.  If you don’t need the camera function, Kodak sells just a mini-printer (P300R) for about $100.  Another option might be the Canon SELPHY QX-10 printer, which also uses dye-sub technology and prints 2.7” square, but it costs as much as the C300R.  I can't really compare these to the \"zink\" cameras and printers, as I have not used them, but dye-sub prints are supposed to last a lot longer than the zink images.Any of these tiny printers are useful tools for journaling, sharing photos at gatherings, or just having a small, tangible object to give someone.  When I took a photo of two women with their dog at a local brewery and gave them the print (which the images above are based upon), they were thrilled with the gesture, and wanted to know more about the C300R. The color rendition with the C300R is very good, and the glossy print that results is so much like a small Polaroid, but better.  As I stated in my recent Monochrome Mania issue 10 - it's a good idea to print  and share those smart phone images, and a mini-printer such as the C300R is a great way to do it."},
{"title": " One Roll Review - Reflx Lab Pro 100", "date": "Saturday, July 08, 2023", "text": "I was in my local camera store and recently picked up a roll of Reflx Lab Pro 100 C-41 film.  I have previously shot with their 400 ISO C-41 film and it was early days for Reflx Lab at that time.  Now, with more experience, and more offerings, Reflx Lab is no longer some unknown little company based in China.  It’s obvious that their excellent packaging (love those aluminum canisters) and approach to offering what are normally ECN-2 films with the remjet removed, as well as other the films that they carry are reaching new customers.  Finding their films on the shelf at Ball Photo in Asheville was a pleasant surprise, and of course, I had to buy a few.  Full disclosure here - after I had purchased the film, about a week later I received a package in the mail from Reflx Lab with 3 rolls of the Pro 100 color film and a new light meter to review.  The light meter is still being evaluated, and I will have a review ready in another week or two.  So, this review is based on the film that I had already purchased.What is Reflx Lab Pro 100?Guess what?  It’s Kodak Aerocolor IV C-41 film.  Before testing the film, I had seen the images of the Reflx Lab 100 Daylight film, which is the Vision 3 5203 50D film.  My first thought was that the packaging had changed, but after development, it was obvious that it was the Aerocolor film because there is no information on the film rebate, and the sprocket holes are typical 35mm still sprocket holes. Side by side, with the Flic Film Elektra 100, it’s obvious that they are the same type of emulsion.  Better yet, the Pro 100 is available from my local photo store, and is reasonably priced at $11.99/roll.Loaded into the Spotmatic SP - and look at that nice littlelight meter from Reflx Labs I shot my first roll of the Pro 100 with my beautiful, black Pentax Spotmatic SP with an uncommon lens - the Vivitar 35-85mm f/2.8 zoom.  I chose colorful subjects, and the resulting negatives did not disappoint me.  The film was developed at Ball Photo, and I scanned it on my Epson V700 flatbed scanner.    Again, the resulting scans are wonderful, with the obvious excellent characteristics of the Aerocolor IV  providing vibrant images with low grain and excellent latitude.What's not to like about the Reflx Lab Pro 100?  It's affordable, has excellent color rendition, it's a true C-41 film, and is available in my local store.  If you are looking for a good all-purpose medium speed color film, this is it.  See my previous post about the Aerocolor IV film for more information on it, and I am glad that Reflx Lab is packaging this excellent color film."},
{"title": " One Roll Review - Elektra 100", "date": "Tuesday, July 04, 2023", "text": "One thing that’s really become apparent in the past few years is the rebranding of film stocks from various sellers. For example, you’ll find Fomapan 100 rebranded as no less than 8 different films.  In the color film world, it's generally been rebranding of Kodak ECN-2 films - some with the remjet removed, such as with Cinestill and Reflx Lab. However, some recent introductions have been a great surprise, and have introduced films that I did not previously know about.  Such is the case of Kodak’s Aerocolor IV, an aerial surveillance film that has a primary purpose in aerial mapping and photogrammetry applications, and the film’s low-grain, high color accuracy, and lack of an orange mask makes it a unique C-41 film that has been languishing in the shadows until very recently.So, enter SantaColor 100, and Flic Film Elektra 100 - both of which are 35mm 36 exposure cassettes of the Aerocolor IV (NOT Aerochrome — that was a false-color IR film). Only the Flic Film tells us what the film actually is.  From what I have read, one can only buy the Aerocolor IV film in 5” x 500 ft lengths - which of course, is going to be quite pricey especially considering that one would likely have to have any film cut to 35mm and sprocketed afterwards.From the Kodak Data Sheet (dated October 2009):“KODAK AEROCOLOR IV Negative Film 2460 is a medium-speed, very fine-grain color negative aerial film. This film has a wide exposure latitude and is specifically designed for processing to a color negative only. Since this film does not have integral color masking, direct interpretation can be made from the negative. Objects are recorded in colors complementary to their natural colors.The ESTAR Base provides flexibility, moisture resistance, high tear resistance, and excellent dimensional stability. KODAK AEROCOLOR IV Negative Film 2460 has an abrasion-resistant emulsion, an antihalation undercoat, and a dyed-gel backing.The hardened emulsion permits high-temperature, rapid processing in roller-transport processors, such as the KODAK Aerial Color Processor, Model 1611, and the KODAK EKTACHROME RT Processor, Model 1811, with Quick-Change, using Process AN-6. This process consists of selected KODAK EA-5 Chemicals and AN-6 Chemicals. Processing can be easily tailored to optimize contrast for specific applications.This film is also compatible with Process C-41. It can be processed in existing C-41 processors using either KODAK FLEXICOLOR Developer or KODAK Developer Replenisher, Process AN-6.”Additionally, the film has an integral UV-absorbing layer so that UV filters are not needed.  However, since the film is on an Estar base, it should be loaded into the camera under dim conditions to avoid light-piping. Okay, what about the Elektra 100?I bought my rolls from Ultrafine Online, one of my three favorite places to shop for film and developing chemistry.The film comes in a black canister, so that it’s not going to be light-piping along the film base from the exposed leader.  Load the film into your camera indoors, if possible.  The ISO is set at 100 - leave it at 100 for the best results.  I loaded my film into my Nikon FM2N  and then went to Spruce Pine, NC for an afternoon of photography with my buddy, Graham Young.  Most of the time I used the 50mm f/2 Nikkor, though in a few instances, I used my 200mmm f/4 Nikkor to isolate a window scene.I had the film developed at Ball Photo in Asheville, and scanned the negatives on my Epson V700 scanner.I have to say, this is a fantastic film.  It has no curl, lies flat in the scanner, and the color rendition is excellent.  It’s supposed to be very low grain, and it certainly is.  There’s no orange mask, but the scanning was perfect.  Here are some samples from that roll.mural, Haywood St, West AshevilleTastee Diner, West AshevilleSpruce Pine, NC as are the rest that followIt’s not an inexpensive film at 12.95/roll, but it’s also not as expensive as some other color emulsions.  At this price, and considering the quality of the images, I think it’s a bargain. I have another roll that I’m saving for some colorful subjects, and I now know what the film is capable of.  Kodak — you really ought to make this film available for 120 and 35mm cameras. For more information from Kodak:Information on available sizes and minimum order quantities of this film is available on the web at www.kodak.com/go/aerial.

{"title": " Kodak, Tennessee", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2023", "text": "Ever since we moved to western North Carolina, I have been interested in exploring and photographing many of the small towns that are in the surrounding counties.  However, once I found out there was a town in Tennessee named Kodak, I knew that I had to visit it to satisfy my curiosity, sort of like when I went to Mongo, Indiana in 2018.  So, after yesterday, I can delete Kodak, TN from my bucket list.First, you may wonder how the town came to be called Kodak, since Kodak is an invented word by George Eastman.  In 1892, the postmaster Harvey N. Underwood, learned of the new \"Kodak\" brand of camera. Underwood decided that this was a name that was easy to remember and spell, hence he sought permission from George Eastman, to use this name for his village and its post office. Eastman granted this permission. I am pretty certain that the original PO building is now a real estate office.  So, here we are with Kodak Road, which alone is a pretty good name. Possibly the original site of the Kodak PO.So, for the summer solstice of 2023, I decided that I would do a day trip to Kodak, photograph places with the name Kodak on them, and do my usual meandering road trip.  When I started out a little after 8:30,  the weather was overcast with light rain, and taking US-25 from Weaverville, made for a scenic ride.  US 25 passes through Hot Springs, as does the Appalachian Trail.  I’ve visited Hot Springs several times, and it sits along the French Broad River, which US-25 crosses several times in Tennessee.  At the TN/NC state line, I stopped to photograph an old sign for the State Line Cafe, which has been replacaed with an antiques store.  US 25 25 took me through Newport, TN, where I found this lovely old store along Lincoln Avenue.  I was supposed to meet up with Donna Moore to receive a bunch of cine film and odd lenses, so we met in the parking lot of the BassPro/Cabela’s store off of I-40W.  The entire region is geared towards tourists, as the Great Smokey Mountains are not far off, and neither is Pigeon Forge,  Dollywood and Gatlinburg. Sevierville is adjacent to Kodak, and parts of Kodak have been incorporated into Sevierville.  The main roads are definitely lined with places that cater to the tourists, except in Kodak proper.  Kodak Road turns into Dumplin Valley Road, which feeds into TN State Route 66, which is also called the Winfield Dunn Parkway.  That’s where the preponderance of business have the word Kodak, including the Kodak Post Office, which dates from the 1989.Driving around the many back roads in the area reveals the rural character and agricultural nature of the businesses.  However, as is typical, there are housing developments being carved out if the farmland.  The original center of Kodak is a four-corners without a traffic light.  The brightly colored Kodak Trade Center is probably the most notable of buildings.  I wonder how much has changed since Kodak was founded in 1892.I had originally planned to shoot a Kodak camera with Kodak film while in Kodak, but the weather was more suited to pulling out a Nikon D300, while dodging the rain drops.  I think I managed to hit most of the highlights.  I also finished up a roll of Derevpan 100 in my Nikon F3HP.   On my return trip, I went S on TN 66 to US-411, which eventually took me to I-40, and back to Asheville.  US-411 is also an interesting drive, as it’s named the Dolly Parton Parkway in Sevierville.   There is a Bush’s Beans plant on that route, and it has a visitor center that was closed by the time that I arrived.  I wonder if real hillbillies get tired of their portrayal?That's a LOT of beansBush's factory.  It was a lot of driving for the day -- the twisty mountain roads eat up a lot of time and not as much distance as those road trips that I used to take in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana.  But, it's NEVER boring!I suppose my next trip that's Kodak-related should be in Kingsport, TN, where Eastman Chemical was located.  That's a little over an hour from my house."},
{"title": "Unfolding a wonder - The Kodak Vigilant SIX-20", "date": "Friday, June 16, 2023", "text": "Over the years, I have had opportunities to photograph with many different folding cameras, ranging from the simple and inexpensive Ansco Speedex, to various flavors of Zeiss Ikon Ikontas, and many in between.  The Kodak Tourist was a widely used 6x9 folder, and are relatively inexpensive on today’s market.  However, the one thing hampering many of the Kodak models is the creation of 620 film - really, just 120 film on a smaller diameter spool.  That one quirk has a lot of people not wanting to shoot with some of the nicer 620 cameras bearing the Kodak label.  Instead, they look to European Agfas, Voigtlanders, Baldas, and Zeiss Ikontas to load with 120 film, and I can’t blame them.  However, the Kodak Vigilant SIX-20 - the best one with the Kodak Anastigmat Special 101mm f/4.5 lens, is a wonderful folding camera, produced from 1939-1948.  It features the Kodak Supermatic shutter with B, T, 1-1/400 sec shutter speeds, and an aperture range of f/4.5-32, and scale focus from 3 feet to infinity.  One of these camera recently came my way - and upon inspection, I realized that it had a roll of film inside, at frame 1.  I inadvertently fired the shutter after I extended the bellows, so then I had 6 exposures left, as you get 8 on a roll of 6x9 cm negs.  I decided to shoot the rest of the roll on some good subjects, so I took the camera down to the Ledges Whitewater Park on the French Broad River, just outside of Asheville.  I decided to rate the film as ISO 50, as I had no idea how old the film was, but I assumed it was at least 50 years old.  I have had a lot of experience with old Verichrome Pan, and knew that I ought to get SOMETHING out of it.  So, in the conditions that I had, I ended up shooting at either 1/50  or 1/100 sec, at an appropriate aperture for the conditions - often at F/8.After I got home, I loaded the film into a Paterson tank, and developed it with  the FPP D-96 for 8 min at 20°C, followed by a water rinse and fixing, and then final rinses.  When I hung up the film to dry, I was really impressed that this film and camera came through with excellent results.  I did not see any problems with pinholes in the bellows, either, but I will do a check on that later.perfectly developed with D-96I love seeing the film info on the leaderAside from wanting to test simple cameras like I did for the medium-format toy camera issue no. 3 for Monochrome Mania (out of print now), I didn’t really want to have to re-spool 120 to 620 spools.  For most of the Kodaks, it’s just not worth it, but with a few exceptions, and this Vigilant SIX-20 is definitely an exception.  I’ll have to re-spool some Kentmere 400 onto 620 so that I can test this camera further.  That nice lens and shutter combothe viewfinder with parallax adjustmentThe design of this camera is quite nice — and a feature that I have not mentioned is the reverse Galilean viewfinder on the top deck. It has a small adjustment for parallax correction, and there is also one of those small reflex viewers at the front of  the bellows, which I hate.  Anyhow, I want to shoot with this camera some more. For one, it’s probably the lightest 6x9 camera that anyone can carry in their bag, and it also easily fits into a coat pocket. Unfolded, it’s still fairly compact, and also easy to use. The only thing that might be a problem is figuring out the distance to the subject, as there is no rangefinder, so one of those old accessory rangefinders might be a good idea to carry with me.  There are other versions of this camera, but none of the others have all the bells and whistles of this one.  That f/4.5 maximum aperture is far better than the others with a maximum aperture of f/6.3 or f/8.8.  The Vigilant isn’t the only camera in this class that can take excellent 6x9 cm images, though.  You could look for a Kodak Monitor SIX-20, and all 4 variants of that camera have a lens with a maximum aperture of f/4.5.  There’s also the Kodak Special SIX-20 and the Kodak Senior SIX-20 - all take 6x9 cm negatives on 620 film, if you haven’t already figured out the SIX-20.   However, if you are looking for a camera that takes 120 film and makes 6x9 cm negatives, I’d look for a Zeiss Ikonta or a Voigtlander Bessa. A folding camera makes a lot of sense for travel, and these folders will give you nice big negatives.  I found that a 3200 dpi scan of one 6x9 negative can produce a 2x3 ft print at 300 DPI.  Not too shabby.  So, be prepared to re-spool the 120 film onto 620 spools if you want to go the Kodak route. If your camera has a sound bellows, clean lens, and accurate shutter, it will be worth the effort for these big negatives."},
{"title": "DSLRs will never go away for me", "date": "Sunday, June 11, 2023", "text": "My D300 with the Sigma 18-50 f/2.8 zoomWith most of the manufacturers going all-in on the mirrorless craze, you'd think the DSLRs are dinosaurs.  With film cameras, SLRs have always been my preferred platform, no matter the manufacturer. My first real camera was an SLR, and that's the way that I have been photographing for a long, long, time. My first DSLR was a Nikon D70s, and I used that camera for almost 10 years before I sold it.  I've shot with a lot of different digital cameras, including the m4/3 Olympus, Nikon 1 system, Fuji X100s, and my latest mirrorless, a Canon EOS M5.  However, were I to consistently use a DSLR, it comes down to a Nikon D3100 - mostly for ebay shots, as it sits on a tripod in my \"studio.\"  My APS-C DSLR for anything else is my D300.  It's a rock solid DSLR that I can trust in any conditions, and works with a lot of lenses.  The only significant downside is that it uses Compact Flash (CF) cards, and not SD cards.  It has sat in the drawer for a while, unused, because I was getting a CHA error message on the 32GB card, and sometimes with a 4 GB card.  I tried a bunch of 1 GB CF cards and no problems. Hmm... I ordered a new 4GB CF card that arrived yesterday and it's fine, so yay!  For me, the D300's 12MP are enough for anything I do, and for macrophotography, it's absolutely great.  My full-frame (FX) DSLR is a Nikon Df, with 16 MP, and again, it's a wonderful camera that uses all of my manual and AF lenses just fine.  It's what I pick up when I want to make great images.  It's paired right now with an old 28mm f/3.5 that was factory AI'd. so it works great as a manual lens on the Df.My point with all this is that I refrained from switching to a Nikon mirrorless Z system because, dammit, I am not made of money, and second, my suite of lenses does everything I need.  The new lenses for those mirrorless Nikons are even bigger than the ones I already have.  There's an insane amount of money being spent by people that think they need a newer system.  Maybe some do, but at what point is there a diminishing return?  I see people saying they need the latest and greatest because they are gear jockeys and to them, that's their thing. Fine. It's your money.  However, the thing is - I don't trust Electronic Viewfinders.  Sure, I use one on my EOS M5, but that's a special purpose camera, not my main one.  With a DSLR, I have a viewfinder that's a direct and immediate connection to what I am seeing.  That's how I do photography. I shoot a DSLR like I shoot film.  So, my now more dependable D300 will get more use, and believe me, it's a great DSLR.  The controls are perfectly placed.  Also, neither my D300 or Df do video.  I'm not a video person, and the fact is, the latest cameras concentrate so much on video, that they lack some functions that appeal to still photographers. Making video-less DSLRs or even mirrorless models, would drop their prices considerably.  I think that's the real crime with these new cameras, and maybe also a reason for some to shoot film cameras - there's no video feature.  My iPhone can certainly handle any short video I may need to do.  Maybe I'm just a curmudgeon, but I bet there are a lot of photographers that would agree with me.  Manufacturers - don't turn every camera into a video camera. make some good, robust, still cameras that appeal to still photographers!  Maybe the Df is the last of the still-only, and that's why I love it."},
{"title": "One Roll Review - Orwo Wolfen NC500", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2023", "text": "I recently shot a roll of this new release (2022) from Orwo, and while it’s certainly not a complete test of this film, I thought that I’d share my results from it. Orwo NC500 is a C-41 color film rated at ISO 400. There is no orange mask that one usually associates with C-41 films, so I have to assume that this film was originally designed for cine use. There is no remjet layer.According to Orwo, \"At the core of our new color film lies a unique chemical formula based on the wonderful and legendary Agfa stock last used in the Oscar-winning film ‘Out of Africa.’ Famous for their greens, desaturated shadows, and enhanced grains, these are all aspects that we are embracing for our new addition. With WOLFEN NC500, we are not trying to imitate current stocks available on the market, we are creating an alternative, something with different characteristics and a different palette.\" In other words, don’t expect results that you might get from a typical C-41 color film. Think more along the lines of using something like a Lomography film such as their Metropolis C-41 film. It makes sense to put something out on the market that’s a color C-41 film, but not the same as every other film, and the NC500 is truly that. It’s got a unique palette that emphasizes the greens, and as I found with my photographs was perfectly suited for woodland images. Since I wasn’t testing this on more colorful subjects, such as strolling along all the street art in the Asheville River Arts District, I can’t comment on how it renders that type of scene. However, given that I shot it while in South Carolina in early May, I’m pretty happy with how it turned out. Not wanting to bias the results in any way, I had the film developed at my local film lab, Ball Photo, in Asheville.A few examples, all shot with my Nikon F3HP, and 28mm and 35mm Nikkors...As you can see, it’s a different film than something like Fuji Superia. Tones are muted, the shadows quite nice, and the images I got from it are quite lovely. To me, the only reason that I might not use this more often is the price. At $16/roll, it's pricey. I don’t shoot a lot of color anyways, but it’s good to have a film that stands out as different from the rest. Scanning the film was easy on my Epson V700, and the film lies relatively flat. I usually do my post-processing in Corel Paintshop Pro, and I did very little with these images. Some people might really appreciate the “retro” look of this film, and it does have sort of a faded snapshot look to it. My view is that once you know a film’s characteristics, you can tailor your choice of shots to that film’s strengths, and in doing so, you can create images that match your expectations. However, you need to try these unique films for yourself, so that you become familiar with them. It’s an interesting film, for sure, that does not fall into the super-saturated category that many have come to expect."},
{"title": " The Fujica GL-690 Professional", "date": "Wednesday, May 31, 2023", "text": "It was about this time last year that I decided that I really wanted a Fujica 6x9 rangefinder, aka the “Texas Leica.”  A previous guest post here in 2016 had nothing to with it, but I do wish that I had purchased one about that time, as prices for medium format cameras of any kind have risen quite a bit.  It was during this search last year that I became aware of many different Fujica 6x9 models, and unfortunately, most of the sellers on eBay for these models are from Japan.  I looked and looked, and what I thought was a reasonable price were “mint” with fungus...  The more recent models such as the GW690 have fixed lenses, more ABS in the body, and were selling in the $600 range or higher.  A decade ago, I could have picked one up for $250.  Anyhow, I was hesitant to spend that much on a camera that had to be shipped from Japan.  A while later, I checked my favorite camera store - KEH, and there was a Fujica GL690 body for sale for $360.  The beauty of the early G-690 series is that they are the original “Texas Leica” and can accept lenses of different focal lengths (although that lens selection is limited, but it's perfect for this camera).  They are also all-metal.  The Fujica GL690  was first released in 1974, and has a front and top deck shutter release - which I find very handy.  Of course, it uses 120 roll film, and gets 8 6x9cm shots per roll.  It could also shoot 220, but that film stock is no longer with us. One thing I found by accident, is that the screw-on eyepice diopters and plain glass covers that work with Nikons, such as the Nikkormats and F3, also fit the Fujica GL690 eyepiece.  Further reading online conforms this.Okay, I had the body from KEH, but no lens was available, either at KEH or eBay.  Derek Keaton, a fellow photographer in Virginia, contacted me after I had posted about my search on Instagram. He had a 100mm Fujinon that might not be working, but it was free.  I figured that had to be the best deal ever, so he mailed it to me.  Yes, it was not working, but there is a camera repair shop not even 10 miles from my house.  So, I took the camera and lens over to Crystal Camera Repair and about a month later, I had my outfit back in perfect working order for $200.  Now that I have been using my Fujica GL690 for about 8 months, I am more comfortable with its operation, and am aware of the quirks - like forgetting to release the shutter lock when removing the lens, and wondering why the camera was not working.  We are all done with the honeymoon period, and this summer, my plan is to use it more often.  I was in Murrels Inlet in SC back in early May, and shot 3 rolls of film with it, equalling 24 exposures. So, from the standpoint of a 35mm user, it’s similar to using my Leica M2, but everything is bigger, and with fewer shots/roll (but with easier film-loading!).  I’ve mostly been using the camera on a tripod, because of what I shoot. However, if I load some Kentmere 400 into the camera, I can go with fully handheld.  It’s a big camera for sure, and that 100mm Fujinon lens is a real nice Tessar-design lens with a maximum aperture of f/3.5. I’ve got a Tamrac bag that the camera fits perfectly, with room for a light meter, film, and any filters I might need.  Since it’s a rangefinder, one has to be aware of that, and the focus spot is pretty easy to see.  You are not going to have the same focus experience as say, a Pentax 6X7, which is an SLR.  It’s definitely like using a very large Leica M2. Since there is no built-in light meter, I use a handheld meter.  I might use my Pentax Spotmeter in the future, if I think it would be more helpful. However, the camera bag only has so much room.  The aperture and shutter speeds are adjusted at the front end of the lens, and once I got used to it, it is quite easy to do.  Much like using a Hasselblad - all the controls are on the lens, which makes sense, since the shutter is IN the lens.  It’s not a focal plane shutter, and as a result, this is perhaps the quietest medium format camera that I have used.  I can barely hear the shutter open and close.  Maybe the Agfa Clack which has the same 6x9 format is quieter, but it’s just a box camera.  The larger negatives are really nice.  If I wanted to, I could make contact prints with them - and I may do so in the future.  For now, just scanning them in on my Epson V700 is enough.  I have made a few prints from the negs with my Canon Pro 200 printer, and they just thrilled me with the detail that this camera can produce.  My only prior experience with a 6x9 rangefinder was the Kodak Medallist II, and the Fujica is a whole world apart in user interface and ease of use.So, this new camera gives me the opportunity to make images on a larger chunk of film with the ease of use of a rangefinder camera, with the same aspect ratio as 35mm.  It’s a keeper, and I look forward to using it a lot more this year.Here are a few samples of what I have shot thus far:  Rocky Fork State Park, TN, RPX25Rocky Fork State Park, TN, RPX25Brookgreen Gardens, SC, Ilford HP5Attalaya, SC, Kentmere 400Carl Milles sculpture, Brookgreen Gardens, SCKentmere 400Brookgreen Gardens, SC, Kentmere 400French Broad River, NC, Rollei RPX 25"},
{"title": " Single Roll Review  - Orwo Wolfen NP100 ", "date": "Friday, May 26, 2023", "text": "In the past, I have felt that ORWO was not very good at their marketing.  They have a suite of very decent 35mm film stocks - most are cine-oriented,  and all were black and white emulsions.  The purchasing of their film in the US was complicated by the rather obtuse distribution methods.  That appears to have changed in the past year or so, with the release of their color film stock NC500, and the Wolfen NP100 films.  I’ve shot with both, and will deal with the C-41 film in a separate post.  The box, but my roll was from the unboxed first run(image from Orwo site)Orwo’s film naming has of course,  been one of their odd quirks.  I’m sure people on the cine side of things know what films they are buying and their characteristics -- that’s not the case for a lot of 35mm still photography people.  A lot of photography hobbyists are swayed in their purchase decision by how cool the naming/packaging is, and there is ample evidence for that. Orwo, however, has kept on with their stodgy naming until the past year.  If you go to their site, it’s a big improvement over what I saw several years ago.  They are taking 35mm still photography more seriously, and have released some updated films as well as “new” ones.  If you look at the four Lomography branded kino films as well as the - ISO 13 and ISO 8 -  those are all Orwo cine stocks, which I have previously reviewed here.So, I think the folks at Orwo finally realized that with the proper branding, their unique cine stocks were getting sales that they were not when it was just plain old Orwo branding, which was like no branding at all.   Now, with their Wolfen brand, they are making their way onto the shelves of stores (both brick and mortar and online) for enthusiasts to try out. That’s a good step forward.  From the promotional information - “Wolfen NP100 100 ISO 35mm x 36exp. Black and White Film from ORWO is an exceptionally fine grain 100 ASA film. This is one of the first brand new and professionally finished photo films launched by the company in decades, proudly still produced in Bitterfeld-Wolfen on the original site where film manufacture has been a tradition since 1910. NP100 differs from WOLFEN UN54 in that it has an additional dyed antihalation layer. This layer is positioned between the base material and the emulsion layer and has the task of preventing the formation of a reflection halo. This improves image sharpness.”  The initial run of this film was said to be 36,000 36 exposure cassettes.I purchased this film in February from the Freestyle Photo online store, and I finally got around to shooting with it in early May on our trip to Murrells Inlet, SC.  Loaded into my F3HP, I shot the roll late in the day along the beach at Huntington Beach State Park.  I mostly used the 35mm f/2 Nikkor, but also the 28mm f/3.5 Nikkor, and as the results show, there was a bit of vignetting with the polarizing filter attached to the 28mm. Developing  It was a definite adventure finding out what developer to use for this film, compounded by the relative newness of the film and that Orwo hasn’t fully embraced the non-German speaking world, as attested by the online documentation.  Somewhere, I saw D-96 mentioned, so as a big fan of that developer, that was good news.  I developed it in D-96 for 8.5 min at 20°C, and the results are excellent.  It’s a fine-grained film on a polyester base - which is great news as the film lies completely flat for scanning.  ResultsOverall, it’s certainly a good 100 ISO black and white film.  As indicated above, the main difference from the NP100 and the UN54 (also ISO 100, and sold by Lomography as Potsdam 100) is the addition of another anti-halation layer.  It may be more than that, but whatever the changes, I liked the results from this film.  With more users, I am sure there will be more reviews with different developers.The scans from my Epson V700 speak for themselves.  Ultimately, it’s best to shoot this film and decide for yourself whether it fits your style of photography.  There are a plethora of ISO 100 black and white film stocks as I have previously posted here, and over the years, my favorite has been Kentmere 100.  Now, if Orwo were to sell the NP 100 in 100 ft bulk rolls at a reasonable price, I would likely use more of it.  While it’s currently selling for $11/roll, it’s among the more expensive b&w films. Still, I applaud Orwo for now promoting their films in a more crowded field of 35mm black and white films (imagine that!)."},
{"title": "HP Photosmart 215 - A 23 year old Digicam", "date": "Wednesday, May 17, 2023", "text": "A few weeks ago, I found this HP 215 digital camera in a local thrift shop for ONE dollar. Typically, I used to see cheap point and shoot 35mm cameras for that price.  For a dollar, I just figured that I’d take a chance that it still worked. One dollar bargain!door opened to reveal USB slot, CF card, and 6V connectorthat little wheel to the left is used to access the menus. There is a 64 MB card in the CF slot. A few facts about the HP Photosmart 215It was introduced in 2000, and has a 1.3 megapixel resolution with a fixed 43mm equivalent (to 35mm) f/2.8 - f/8 lens.  In 2000, it was early years in the digital photography takeover of traditional film cameras, and at 1.3 megapixels, there is no way any serious photographer was going to buy this camera.  However, computer users love the new shiny objects, and the HP 215 was marketed as part of the computer culture, promising instant photos that could be shared/printed as needed.  Using 4AA cells, the camera was inexpensive to operate, and it came with a 4MB CF card. You can find the online manual on HP's site. The first HP Photosmart camera was introduced in 1997 with VGA resolution (640 x 480 pixels).  So, the 215 is an improvement, but just barely. In 2000, a consumer-level 1.3 MP camera was considered to be low-end, but usable enough to make 4x6 prints, and of course, Hewlett Packard produced a suite of accessories with the Photosmart name - printers and scanners to match up with their Windows-based PCs.  It wasn’t until at least 3MP cameras became widely available that the 35mm point and shoots were in trouble.  For the snapshot audience, 1.3MP wasn’t too awful, and the HP 215 retailed for around $200, and I can just imagine folks saying how much less they would be spending on film.  I recall having an Apple Quicktake that had less than 1 MP - I think the images were 640x480 pixels. For putting up images on the new World Wide Web, those were fine. I see them now as postage-stamp sized shots that can never be made better - unlike a film negative or transparency. Hewlett Packard continued selling HP Photosmart cameras into at least 2007, but their printers continued on after that. The Photosmart Cameras were always at the low-end, but they were affordable snap shot digital cameras.  The HP 215 is quite boxy-looking, and there are few controls.  The lens is fixed at one focal length, but the auto-focus allows one to also use macro mode - 4” to 3 feet.  Normal mode is about 2 feet to infinity. To begin use, you insert 4 AA cells and a Compact Flash (CF) card.  The first time I used the camera, I had a hard time examining the images from the computer until I reformatted the card in the camera.  Import was just dragging and dropping the images to a folder on my desktop (Mac Mini, late 2012, running Mac OS X Catalina).  I found the optical viewfinder to be relatively useless due to parallax at anything closer then 20 feet.  So, I used the rear LCD screen to frame my image before pressing the shutter button.  There is a significant, several second delay in writing the image to the CF card at full 1.3 MP resolution. The camera shows it age in the menu access and controls as well as the small LCD screen.  But hey, this was the year 2000, and anything with a color LCD display was high-tech.  Operationally, it takes a while to get used to the slowness of the camera, and the strange click wheel for accessing the camera settings.Once I loaded the images onto my computer, I was really a bit surprised at how good most of them turned out.  Granted, they are only 1200 x 1600 pixels, and you really can’t crop them the way you can a 20 MP image, but if you only wanted to make small prints or put images up on the Internet, they are not bad.  Of course, the color response and sharpness isn’t as good as modern digicams or even my iPhone, but for a dollar, I can’t complain. As you can see from the images below, the results are actually pretty good.I get that young people may be interested in using these “vintage” digicams, and 1.3 MP may be lower than you’d want to go.  The camera reminds me a bit of a “Digital Diana” that I owned around 2010.  I did a little search on eBay, and was surprised to see the HP 215 cameras sold from $2.99 to $22.99, depending on what was included.  If you want to make 4x6 prints, you could get by with one of these, and who am I to judge?  Going by what was available at the time - a Nikon D1 SLR with 2.7 MP sold for $5000 in 2000.  That was the camera that basically took over the news industry, as it was good enough for newspaper printing.  The 'best” digital camera for 2000 was the Nikon Coolpix 990, with 3.3 MP, an ingenious tilt/swivel camera that accepted a variety of accessories, and it retailed for about $900.  I used a Coolpix 990 extensively, well after it was produced, and it was an amazingly good digital camera.  At the other end of the spectrum was the kid’s Jam Cam with 640 x 480 pixels that retailed for about $60. So, in 2000, the HP Photosmart 215 was a good buy for the casual snapper that was going to be happy with making small prints or sharing images via email.  I think if you want to experiment with lo-fi digital, this camera would be a good place to start!"},
{"title": " FPP X-Ray 120 film", "date": "Tuesday, April 25, 2023", "text": "While there are a lot of exotic emulsions that are available for 35mm, there are significantly fewer options for 120 film.  So, imagine my surprise when I saw a 120 film that’s NOT available in 35mm.  The Film Photography Project has recently released FPP X-RAY 120 film that is a 100 ISO high-contrast orthochromatic film that can be developed in typical black and white chemicals.  I really didn’t know what to think when I first realized that it was called an X-ray film, as I am used to seeing films sold as sheet film - and with the other oddball things like some x-ray films being coated on both sides, and of very low ISO ratings.  This IS NOT one of those films.  For one, it’s on a PET base, and has a recommended ISO of 100, though I have seen where it could be rated up to 400 with decent results.  Second, like other X-ray films, it’s orthochromatic, and is insensitive to red light, so you could develop it under a red safelight.   It has no anti-halation layer, so it’s best to load the film in subdued light, or you might get light piping.Zeiss Ikon Box TengorI’m game for oddball films, and I had no preconceived notions about this film.  I loaded one roll into a Zeiss Ikon Box Tengor 56 box camera, and the other roll into my Yashicamat 124.  The choice to use it in the box camera was a spur of the moment thing, when I was out having a beer or two with my friend Bill Pivetta.  Maybe a bad idea, but as you’ll see, maybe not.The Yashicamat is a camera that would be a good test for this film, since I have excellent control over my exposures.  I rated the film at ISO 100, and used the TLR’s built-in meter.  I shot most of that roll at an Asheville camera group meetup on April 16, and that was a better test of this film.I developed both rolls in D-96 for 6.5 minutes at 20°C, and probably 6 minutes would have been just fine, as well.  I was just aiming for what I thought might be a good well-developed negative, given that the instructions read 6 min in D-76.ResultsZeiss Ikon Box TengorBeach Volleyball at the Highland Brewery meadow Great mural in West Asheville, featuring Dolly and RuPaulThe results from the Box Tengor were actually pretty good, though some of the shots were overexposed.  There’s also a bit of \"blooming\"in some of those images, because of the uncoated lens, as well as the overexposure.  I picked two of the best 6x9 cm negatives.Yashicamat 124That's Reuben's Yashicamat 124.Thanks for posing, Emily! Luckily, Emily stopped by at our meeting, and while she’s a photographer, she is also an  art model, so she posed for a few shots at the Wedge Brewery, and I was able to test the remainder of the roll of the X-ray film under somewhat cloudy bright conditions.  Over near Craggy Gardens off the Blue Ridge ParkwayThe results from the Yashicamat were very good, and it’s obvious that the film is very fine-grained, with great tonal range -- and orthochromatic, as reds are very dark.  The detail was excellent. I need to buy some more rolls of this film and really test it with different lighting situations and subjects.Overall, I think this a film with the potential to create some very interesting images.  I love the packaging from the FPP (which of course has nothing to do with selecting this film!), and the film has edge markings for frame numbers.  The backing paper has very easily seen black markings on a white background, so for those of you that use a red window to line up your exposures, it will be easy to line up to the proper spot for each exposure.  I think this might be a fun film to use in a Holga on a sunny day.  For the Box Tengor, the shutter speed is about 1/30 sec, which in full sun, even at f/16, would be overexposed by two stops.  You can’t use a red filter, because it’s an ortho film.  A neutral density gel would possibly work well with a simple box camera in full sun."},
{"title": "One Roll Review - FPP's Sun Color C-41 film", "date": "Monday, April 24, 2023", "text": "One Under the SunLeave it to Mike Raso of the Film Photography Project to come up with yet another interesting low-ISO film.  Not Yeti, but a C-41 color film called Sun Color.  When I was in Cleveland, Ohio for our FPP recording sessions, Mike handed me a couple of rolls to try out.  It's not my first rodeo with super slow films, as you well know by now.  However, a C-41 film with an ISO of 1 isn't something that comes along every day.  In keeping with its name, I chose a super sunny day here in North Carolina to give my first roll a test.  I loaded the Sun Color into my Nikon FM2N, and went for a stroll through part of the Asheville River Arts District, which I have found to be an excellent spot to shoot test rolls - especially color film.I should point out that with an ISO of 1, my camera's meter system does not allow me to go below 12.  Since the FM2N is completely manual, I chose to use Sunny-16 with my Sun Color.  To break that down to shoot handheld, remember that  Sunny-16 is the ISO = shutter speed at f/16 in full sun, which means that if I shot Sunny 1 at f/16, I'd need a 1-second exposure.  Well, that's not going to work handheld, is it?  So, using my fingers to count, 1 sec @ f/16, equals f/2.8 @1/30 sec. - 5 stops opened from f/16.  Assuming that since it's a C-41 film, it should have some latitude, I can just walk around shooting at 1/30 at f/2.8-f/4 in full sun and get reasonable  results.  I could also use my iPhone light meter app, but I went with my Sunny-16 mojo and shot the roll handheld as I walked around.  Here's the great reason to use an ultra-low ISO film -- you can shoot wide open if you want to, in full sun, and reap the benefit of shallow depth of field - especially for close objects and portraits.  I didn't do any portraits that day, but maybe with my second roll, I will.I developed the Sun Color in my FPP C-41 kit - the original two-step kit, and was pleased to see the film looked quite good as I hung it up to dry.  It's a special-purpose cine film, since it has the slightly rounded sprocket holes characteristic of cine 35mm film.  Not being an ECN-2 film, it can be developed at a lab without any problems.  The yellow walls - beige-ish.Supposed to be the colors of UkraineMy resultsAs you can see in the photos, colors are muted in the color chart, and while green and red red show, yellow seems to come out as white or very, very pale yellow, as seen with the photo of the blue and yellow shipping containers. Yet, the traffic sign neon yellow show up!  Blues are more cyan, and orange is muddy, but still, the colors are somewhat unpredictable, which means more fun. I rank this film in the same league as some of the Lomo experimental films - it's going to surprise you and still delight you with the results.  These mailboxes are bright orange and yellow.Overall, I am really pleased with the results from this unique film.   Don't be afraid of shooting with low-ISO films - they offer a different set of challenges, to be sure.  Whether you shoot color or black and white, low-ISO films can really change your game when it comes to street photography.  Going handheld isn't a problem on a sunny day, and I do recommend a tripod for overcast and certainly evening shots.  I don't know how this film would do for city lights at night, but it's gong to be long exposures, for sure!  I suggest you start out with Sun Color on a sunny day, and see where it takes you."},
{"title": " One Roll Review - Silberra S25 b&w film", "date": "Monday, April 17, 2023", "text": "This post has been a while in the making.  I originally received a roll of the S25 back in January 2021, for my donation to the Indiegogo campaign by Silberra in 2017.  I shot that that roll in October 2021, while in Arizona. However, instead of having the FM3A in A mode, I had accidentally set the shutter speed dial to 1/4000 sec, and for some idiotic reason, I was not paying attention to what the camera was doing/showing and was snapping away until I realized my folly.  That has to be the most bone-headed thing I have done in my years of photography.  Needless to say, there was not much in the way of recoverable images on that roll.  In November of that year, I found that Blue Moon Camera had a supply of the Silberra films, so I ordered a roll of the S25, 50 b&w films, and 50 ISO color film (which I have yet to shoot).   A few weeks ago, I finished up the S25 roll in Cleveland while there for the FPP recording sessions, as well as the Beers and Camera meetup.  What is Silberra S25? Silberra, a Russian company based in St. Petersburg (I can only assume they are still in business, but with the war on Ukraine I doubt they are getting purchases from the US), came onto the scene in 2017, and launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise money for their production of b&w films.  Their website silberra.com is still active, so I assume that they are still selling their products.  Silberra S25 film is a slow, ISO 25 black and white film with high resolution, super low grain, medium contrast, and extended red sensitivity.  The beauty of an ISO 25 film is that you can shoot with it in daylight with wide apertures to achieve that beautiful separation of foreground from the background.  My favorite low-speed panchromatic film was Kodak’s Panatomic-X, which I usually shot at ISO 25.  Agfa’s APX 25 was another classic slow film, and more about that later.  Just about the finest-grained (as in no grain) was Kodak’s Technical Pan film, which at ISO 25, also has an extended red sensitivity.  I still have a lot of Tech Pan, but the problem with that film is that it requires a special low-contrast developer to achieve the proper gray middle tones.  With APX 25 (and it’s successor, Rollei RPX 25), as swell as the Silberra S25, D-76 can be used for the developer.  That’s an important aspect for most users - easily obtained developers.I shot my latest roll of S25 with my Minolta Maxxum 7000 - which I use with an M-42 adapter to take advantage of those delightful Super -Takumar lenses from Pentax.  I call it my Spotmatic with a motorized film advance.  Used in Aperture-Priority mode, it becomes a great camera for M-42 lenses (in manual aperture, not auto aperture).  I developed the film in D76 1:1 for 6.5 minutes, water stop, and normal fixing.  One thing I should note about the film - it was sold in one of those plastic reloadable cassettes, which is the first time I have seen that from a vendor. There were no edge markings on the film.Results - Here are some images from the roll of Silberra S25. All were scanned on my Epson V700, with minor adjustments in Corel Paint Shop Pro.I am quite pleased with the results.  When there is a great deal of contrast in a scene, the shadows are quite dense, and for some, that can be a bonus.  When there is less contrast, the film seems to have great latitude, and very pleasing tonality.  The film base is polyester, and there are no edge markings.  It’s said that the film is one of the Agfa Aviphot surveillance films, which it certainly may be.  It is also quite similar to the Rollei RPX-25, which has similar characteristics.  I reviewed the RPX 25 in February, 2020.  Anyhow, I enjoy shooting low-iso films, such as this.  I get results that are different from the typical ISO 100 and 400 films that I normally shoot with.  Since these are panchromatic films, they can be used with yellow or red filters to achieve more dramatic results, and since I have shot the last of my Silberra b&w film, I have ordered some RPX 25 to test further.  To me, that’s the beauty of film - different emulsions can give so very different results using the same camera and lens."},
{"title": "One Roll Review - Ferrania Orto 50", "date": "Wednesday, April 12, 2023", "text": "Before modern-day panchromatic b&w film emulsions appeared, film was orthochromatic - sensitive to the blue part of the spectrum, but insensitive to red.    Wet-plate photographers still deal with this, and their images have a special look that while retro, are modern.    Likewise, modern orthochromatic emulsions - and there are a few - are geared towards a special use as in 35mm cine applications, or like the ortho emulsions from Ilford, Rollei, and now Ferrania - offer a special look that panchromatic films cannot.     Ferrania has been producing their P30 panchromatic film since late 2017, which was a bit of a surprise for the backers hoping for an E-6 film. However, as in my 2018 review of the P30, I liked the black and white film, which said to be an old-school emulsion with rich blacks and wonderful tonality.  The film certainly gained a fan.    Moving to 2023, Ferrania has just announced their Orto 50 orthochromatic black and white film.    I was given a test roll by the Film Photography Project  to see how this film looks.   From Ferrania’s web site, here is their description of Orto 50: \"In the earliest days of silent cinema, film stock was blue-sensitive or orthochromatic. Hollywood relied on cosmetics as a \"corrective\" for on-screen actors. One hundred years later, the very \"flaws\" that plagued our predecessors are now the creative features that distinguish orthochromatic films today.\" This is a true statement - orthochromatic films are definitely for those that want a unique look to their images, as reds turn into dark tones in this film. I don’t usually shoot people in my photography, but if you do, ortho films give an old-time look to portraits. In addition, these low-iso ortho films are fine-grained and great for architecture and many landscapes.    In urban settings, they give a contrasty old-school look to images, and that’s why I love to shoot with them.Ferrania recommends that you shoot this film at box speed, ISO 50. That holds true for other Ortho films, such as Ilford Ortho Plus (ISO 80), and Rollei Ortho 25.  Shoot at box speed!I loaded the film into my Pentax Spotmatic SP II with a 55mm f/1.8 Super-Takumar lens, and headed out on a walk along Haywood Road in West Asheville.    It’s a great place to test any film, with colorful murals, store fronts, bars, and many signs.  It was a good test for this film on a wonderfully sunny day.I developed the film in FPP D-96 for 8 minutes, as recommended by Ferrania. I used constant agitation for the first minute, and then agitated for 15 seconds, stopped for 15 seconds, and repeated that until the 8 minutes was up.    Water stop, and 8 minutes in fixer.   As soon as I hung the film to dry, I knew that I’d be happy with my results.red is very black with this film, as it is insensitive to it.Lots of blue tones here, so they are lighter"},
{"title": "Why the iPhone is a pretty good camera", "date": "Tuesday, April 04, 2023", "text": "My latest issue of Monochrome Mania is available from my Etsy site - Monochrome Mania No. 10, Pocketing Memories.  It’s a departure from most of my issues in that all of the b&w images were originally taken with an iPhone, not a film camera.  I’ll admit that I had some trepidation in putting this issue together, since it’s a departure from my previous issues -- but wait! Monochrome Mania is about the b&w image, no matter how it’s produced.  Having a tangible product and not an e-zine  is what Monochrome Mania is all about.   I purchased my first Apple iPhone in 2017, and it became a secondary image-maker, and a readily available photographic notebook.  I often shot with it to record exactly where I was, since the location data accompanies every image.  Many times, I use it to gauge how an image may look in square format, or in monochrome, and it becomes a tool that accompanies my film use.  Beyond that, however, it’s also a creative instrument that allows me to photograph a scene and see the result in real time, and store it away in my pocket until later.  My first iPhone was an SE model - smaller and less expensive than what is currently available.  It was replaced with an iPhone XR in 2019, which I am still using.  There’s no doubt that camera phones have killed compact digital camera sales, since for many people, their camera phone does all that they need.  Always ready and easily pocketed, camera phones have sophisticated software to provide the user with images that probably are far better than they would have gotten with a compact digicam.  There’s also the idiom that the best camera is the one you have with you, and for many, it’s going to be a smartphone.So, the latest issue has been curated to show a variety of images - some grouped by subject matter, and all have been taken since about 2017.  As you go through the issue, I have some commentary on Walker Evans, who totally embraced the then new Polaroid SX-70 as a creative instrument.  I think if you take his comments about the SX-70, they could easily be applied to the camera on a smart phone.  Of course, printing an image is important, and you can now purchase small printers that connect to your phone via Bluetooth and print your iPhone images as if you were using a Polaroid -- at a lower price point.  Something that I think more people should do with their photos.You should also consider that you can take your smartphone images and turn them into b&w negatives in your favorite image processing program, and make digital negatives that can be used to make cyanotypes and other alternative-process analog prints.  I have been very happy with the comments by readers of this issue.  In several instances, they were inspired to use their iPhone as a “real camera” and take time to compose and use the filter that matched their vision.  Others have told me that this is my best issue so far, in terms of the images and the presentation. Hopefully, you’ll read the issue and be inspired to use your smartphone or at least happy with the images that I present.  That’s what Monochrome Mania is trying to do - engage you in the world of black and white photography, in all of its facets.Monochrome Mania No. 10, Pocketing Memories is 40 pages, including the covers. At $10 + shipping, it's still a bargain these days."},
{"title": "Read A Photography Book!", "date": "Sunday, March 19, 2023", "text": "In my many decades of photography, it should not come as a surprise that I’ve accumulated a lot of knowledge in my noggin.  I look back to my teen years, when my first darkroom experience was in a high school class taught by my science teacher.  That first roll developed from my Kodak Instamatic (Verichrome Pan) was magical, and I have never lost that sense of a magical moment when I pull a roll of film from the developing tank.  Almost 50 years later, I still enjoy developing my film and using film cameras, despite the obvious alternative – which of course, I do also use.  There are many reasons to use a digital camera, and just as many reasons to use film, especially black and white, which I believe offers more opportunities to explore creative avenues that digital just can’t match.Over the course of many years on social media, and more recently, Reddit, it’s become clear to me that there are a lot of new users that want to experience what film cameras have to offer, and it’s also clear to me that many of those people are also unlikely to look for a book in a library about film photography.  It’s hard to ask or answer questions without a common framework of terms, without a common grounding in basics.   First of all, photography is photography, whether it’s done with a digital sensor or a piece of film.  Those basic functions of exposure – aperture, shutter speed, and sensitivity (ISO) are the same.  If all you have ever used before is a smart phone, then I can understand your lack of knowledge.  But if you have been using a camera – whether a point and shoot, a DSLR, or a mirrorless camera with interchangeable lenses, there are rudimentary principles behind those exposures that you should grasp.  Any basic book of photography has that information, as well as the camera manuals.  Those principles don’t change if you are using a film camera.  In fact, things actually get simpler.My first piece of advice is to BE CURIOUS and do your research.  That means to actually read up on whatever it is that you want to do, and not expect a quick answer from someone on an online forum to a question that’s easily answered in most photography books.  I have this suspicion that many people today do not actually read a damn thing, but rely on YouTube videos that may actually have misinformation.  I don’t want to come across as a cranky old man – but you can’t ignore the value of an easily carried around book.  A book such as the following listed here are my recommendations to learning about using a film camera and photography:Bellamy, Andrew. 2017.

It's less than $5 at Thriftbooks.com.You can’t go wrong with the Horenstein book for black and white photography.  It’s very popular in b&w photography classes, and I believe it’s the best book for beginning photographers.  Of course, there are many, many books out there for learning about photography, and about other photographers, but I point to those above as the best starting points. If you have one, you will find answers to most of the questions that beginning film photographers will have – and they are there in black and white, at all times.There, now you have a good reference that’s been vetted by publishers and thousands of users, not the opinion of some random keyboard commando.  From here on, you'll have a useful guide to get you started in using a film camera, and throughout your photography career.If you are able to take a photography class, it's always a good option - sometimes they are offered as adult education classes, one-day workshops, or courses for college credit.  The only \"class\" I ever had was the one in high school.  Today, there is a vast reservoir of information online from film manufacturers, photography sites, and of course, social media.  The other avenue is working with a mentor - a person with lots of experience and the ability to spend time with someone wanting to learn.   In lieu of a class or a mentor, a book can be the best resource - always available at any time.  Don't expect to know it all at once - photography can be as simple or as complex as you want.  Take your time to learn the basics, and the rest will be much easier."},
{"title": " A Tale of Two Yashica Electro 35 GTNs", "date": "Thursday, March 09, 2023", "text": "Pretty, and deceivingA few posts ago, I reviewed my experience with a beater of a Yashica Electro 35 GTN.  Several weeks later, another example of the same model fell into my lap, and it was in pristine condition, shutter speeds and indicator lights were perfect.  I rewound the few frames that I'd shot in my \"beater\" GSN, and loaded the \"new\" GSN with the roll of Kentmere 400, and it went along inside my car for some brief photo trips, including my recent visit to Pittsburgh.  I was shooting with it last week, and realized that sometimes the camera felt as though something wasn’t quite right - and I also saw that sometimes the rewind lever rotated as I advanced the film, and sometimes - most often, it did not.  I rewound the film and developed it the next day.  Much to my disappointment, almost all the frames were overlapped - some just by a sprocket width, some by a half frame, and others, barely overlapped.  Some were up to 3 exposures overlapped.  As you can see in the video, I checked the advance AFTER the fact, and this is what I should have done in the beginning:On the plus side, everything was in good focus and properly exposed, but as you can see, it was a bad film advance.  Afterwards, I loaded a many-times exposed test roll that I keep for testing cameras, and with the back open, I could see that the advance would work, and then not.  I could actually hear a difference in the winding when that happened, and it matched what I heard when shooting with it.  Had I tested it that way initially, I would have been spared the disappointment.  So, I will put that lovely example in a box and sell it as a repair camera, and go back and use the beater GTN that works well.  Lesson learned -- and it’s a good thing that I mostly used the Nikon F3HP when I was in Pittsburgh.  Those shots came out great.see the overlapping framesSo, remember to test a camera with a junk roll to make sure that the mechanical aspects of film winding go as they are supposed to.  In my desire to use that pretty GTN, I forgot to do the one thing that would have saved me from failure later on.Here's a few photos from the roll - maybe I can call them \"art!\""},
{"title": "Tried and true, the Minolta SRT 202", "date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2023", "text": "My Minolta SRT 202At risk of being thought of as a Nikon snob, it’s time to look at another SLR system that can still be found at a decent price. The Minolta SRT series features fully manual operation, the great “lollipop and stick” match-needle meter indicator, relatively robust construction, and the choice of lots of excellent Rokkor glass to choose from.  The first SRT, the 101, appeared in 1966, replacing the SR series of SLRs.  The T in SRT stands for TTL metering, and accordingly, the old SR-mount lenses were replaced with MC lenses, which are the same mount, but with the ability to transfer the aperture reading to the meter, via a tab on the base of the lens, much like Nikon’s AI lenses.  While the SRT series was produced for over a decade, each iteration of models have slight improvements over the years.  It was after these cameras that Minolta went to more electronics and automation, starting with the X series in the mid-70s.  The SRT 101, 102, 202 are all quite similar cameras, with the 202 being released in 1975.  The last camera of the SRT series was the SRT 200, which was released in 1977, and it was much like its predecessor, the SRT 100, which was a cheaper version of the SRT 101, and lacked some of the features, with a 1/500 sec max shutter speed.  The SRT 200’s max shutter speed was 1/1000 sec.  All of the SRT models have a cloth, horizontally-traveling shutter curtain, match-needle metering, and required a 1.35v Mercury cell for the meter.The thing to remember with the SRT series is that most of those cameras are now around 50 years old.  Some of them may not have been treated kindly, and Minolta’s SLRs do not have the quality of build as say, a Nikon Nikkormat.  The meters can operate with a modern 1.5V PX-625A cell, but you’ll need to compensate for the voltage difference by rating your film 1 stop slower - such as setting the ISO dial to 200 for 400 ISO film.  You can also purchase an MR-9 battery adapter that reduces the voltage from a normal AG13 button cell which cost about $30, but can be used in any camera that requires a PX-625 cell. Beware of imitators- some are advertised as such, but do not reduce the voltage. Once you have acquired a good working SRT202 or 102, you’ll be instantly surprised at how simple it is to operate. You use the meter in the viewfinder to align the “lollipop” with the “stick” - either by adjusting the aperture, the shutter speed, or both to what should be a satisfactory exposure.  The lens is easily focused in the viewfinder, and once you are happy with the composition, press the shutter button after the film has been wound.  This is really basic stuff, and if you use the camera for a couple of rolls of film, you will find it easier to operate each time.  The beauty of the SRT 202 is that the aperture and shutter speed are both seen in the viewfinder, so you don’t have to look at the control knobs while adjusting for a proper exposure. I highly recommend the 50mm f/1.4 lens, and if you find a 45mm f/2 Rokkor-X lens, get one. It’s sort of a pancake lens, takes up little space, and is a good all-around normal lens.  My other choice, if you have been reading this blog, would be the 35mm f/2.8 Rokkor-X lens.  Beyond that, whether you are going for wide-angle or telephoto, there’s plenty of lens choices in the MC and MD lens line. .  I used to do a lot of macrophotography with my Minolta X-700, and Minolta’s macro accessories are some of the best that you’ll find.   Let’s get back to the SRT202  and its siblings.  The SRT 202 can meter with films with an ISO ranging from 6 to 1600.  That is pretty impressive, as many SLRs from that period typically have a minimum ISO setting of 25.  Of course, if you use an external meter, that may not matter much.  Nonetheless, there are some very interesting low ISO films out there to try.  If your camera’s meter is working properly, that really makes using the camera so much simpler.  Remember to turn on the meter using the switch on the bottom of the camera.  Turn it off when stowing the camera for any length of time.Flash photography - any simple single-contact flash unit that uses the standard hot shoe or via a pc cord (x-sync) will allow you to take photographs using strobe flash.  It really doesn’t matter who the manufacturer is, but Vivitar and Sunpak flashes work well, and there are a lot to choose from in the used market, for next to nothing.  Auto-thyristor flashes are preferred, as they give off the proper amount of light for a particular ISO setting and aperture.  The SRT 202 has a maximum flash sync speed of 1/60 sec (in red on the dial), so to use a flash, you would use a 1/60 sec or slower shutter speed.The main thing with the SRT series is that they are relatively simple cameras to operate, and are excellent manual cameras.  The thing to remember when buying used, is that they newest of them are nearly 50 years old,  and not all of them were treated well by previous owners.  The most common problems you’ll encounter are non-working light meters, jammed film advances, or inaccurate shutters.  That doesn’t mean that every SRT will have problems, but when trying one out, those are key things to look for. If the meter isn’t working, that’s easily overcome, but the other problems are not.  Having said that, I see far more X-series Minolta SLRs with problems, so stick with the all-manual SRTs.The one feature that the SRT 202 lacks is mirror lockup - a feature that I have very rarely used.  If you have your camera mounted securely on a tripod and are making Bulb  exposures, using a cable release is a good idea.  For 1 sec exposures and up, you could just use the self-timer to avoid shaking the camera.  Mirror lockup is just one of those features that most of us never use.The source for the manual images hereThe SRT cameras do not sell for a lot, so you should be able to purchase one on eBay in working condition at prices from $30 - $200, depending on whether the camera has been tested or not, etc.  For $30 or less it might make sense to buy a camera that is “untested”, but some sellers actually are offering tested, repaired, and guaranteed SRT 202 cameras for about $180 - which seems pretty fair to me in light that there would not be any problems post-sale.So, while yes, there are other camera brands out there, given the number of excellent Minolta lenses at decent prices, it makes sense to give a Minolta SRT 202, or 102, etc., a chance and see if it's the right fit for you.  The simplicity of the control layout is a plus. A few images from this camera, all with Kentmere 400:"},
{"title": "Eastman 5243 Internegative Film", "date": "Monday, February 13, 2023", "text": "Sometimes it's fun to just try things and see what happens...My buddy Bill Pivetta gave me an unopened 1000 ft reel of 35mm motion picture stock last summer, and until recently, it sat in the fridge.  I finally got around to spooling up some of that 1000 ft reel into a 35mm bulk loader, and from that, I loaded up a couple of 35mm cassettes.  The “mystery film” is Eastman 5243 color internegative film.  It’s been really difficult to find much information about it, except that it was used in Star Wars (1977) to produce the final negative for the positive copies for distribution.  The database of film stocks indicates that this film was discontinued in the late 1950s, but that is not the case.  These big reels of film appear to be relatively “recent” - perhaps from the 1980s.  In any case, I was intrigued to see what I might get from this film.  Knowing that similar special-purpose cine films have a low ISO, I decided on an ISO of 1.5, which is 2 stops more exposure than my F4’s lowest ISO setting. So, I just set the exposure compensation dial to +2, giving me an ISO of 1.5 for in-camera metering purposes.  While shooting, I bracketed from +2 to +1 and 0, for an estimated ISO of 1.5, 3.0, and 6.   On a full sunny day, sunny-16 for this film would be about 1 second at f/16, or about 1/15 sec at f/4.  I shot the roll in the River Arts District, and developed the film in C-41 chemistry along with a roll of Kodak Vision 3 500T.  Before developing, I gave the two rolls a good soak in an alkaline solution of Sodium bicarbonate and Sodium carbonate, and then shook the tank like a cocktail shaker for 4 rinses to get as much remjet off the films as possible - about 99%. I then proceeded to do a typical developer and blix, followed by a series of washes.before  scanningThe resulting negative has a greenish base, and while the base was rather dense, I could see the negatives, and my eye says the ISO 1.5 was pretty close.  Scanning gave me some interesting results.  For one, it’s obvious that the film has lost some color sensitivity, and I don’t know if the blue-green base color is merely the result of age - which it certainly could be, or a factor of age and storage conditions.  I don’t think the film was refrigerated.  The color matrix in the first image shows how the film now records colors.   The grain is fine, as I would expect from an internegative film.  There is some odd coloration in some frames - and perhaps that’s from age, as this was the beginning of the large roll.  With some post processing in my favorite image editor (Corel Paint Shop Pro), I did some fade correction and exposure correction.  The resulting colors are muted, and some people might find them very appealing.  5243 color chart after some tweakingcolor chart as it's supposed to look (iphone)I don’t think there would be all that much difference had I developed the film in ECN-2 chemistry.  After all, this is a special purpose, slow cine film that’s probably at least 40 years old.  I may try another roll soon and see how it goes.  However, that’s the beauty of testing a strange film --strange results.   I don’t know if there would be enough interest for me to sell any reloaded 35mm cassettes with the 5243 film at ISO 1.5.  Obviously there’s no guarantee on the results, but if you are interested in acquiring a few rolls of 5243 at a low price, let me know (USA only), as I have almost 1000 feet of it... before any correctionsFor  comparison, here is a frame from Vision 500T developed in the same tank:Vision 500T, Nikon FE10."},
{"title": " Becoming a Confident Photographer", "date": "Wednesday, February 01, 2023", "text": "Over the years that I have been writing this blog (since late 2004), it’s become sort of a series of articles about cameras, film, lenses, and some how-to posts.  Occasionally, I dip into travelogues and news about the field.   A few times, I discuss more intangible things.  Back in early November, I visited Manteo, NC and the Outer Banks.  Although we have lived in NC since mid-2019, it was my first trip to coastal NC since our move here, which is a 7-8 hour drive, or 444 miles to Manteo.  It’s been nearly 30 years since I’d been to the Outer Banks, and while I have some memories from that trip, I was never in one place long enough to really appreciate the area, and it was before I was a serious photographer.  This trip was a good getaway for 4 nights in Manteo, the largest town on Roanoke Island  - and the gateway to the Outer Banks.  I had brought my Nikon F3HP and my Nikon FE, my Fujica GL690, as well as some toy cameras, including the Ansco Pix Panorama and the Lomo Sprocket Rocket.  The only digital was my iPhone.  Early November may seem like an odd time to visit the Outer Banks, but most of the tourists are gone, the weather is usually good, and lodging is a bit cheaper.  We rented a cottage right in Manteo, and everything was walkable to the waterfront. I used the F3 only with b&w film, and the FE had only Kodak Pro Image 100.  Most of the film I shoot is b&w, no matter the format, but having one camera with color for colorful subjects is always a good idea.Bodie Island Lighthouse, Ansco Pix Panorama, Kentmere 100On a trip such as this one, I tend to stick to a couple of films, and I chose HP-5+ and Kentmere 100 for the F3.  My main lens was the 35mm f/2 Nikkor, but I occasionally used other lenses when I thought it was necessary - the 24mm f/2.8 Nikkor, 56mm f/1.6 Lensbaby Velvet, 85mm f/2 Nikkor, and the 75-150mm f/4 Series E telephoto.   For the FE, I only used the 50mm f/2 Nikkor.  The only other b&w film I shot was a roll of Rollei RPX 25, on a dramatic windy day along the coast of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Elizabeth II, Nikon F3HP, Series E 75-150 zoom, HP-5Now, what does the title of this post have to do with the above information?  Well, as I was shooting the scenes that I encountered, I was quite sure that I would get some really good photographs.  I was confident in my equipment and lens choices, I was using films that I had a long experience with, and I was confident in my decisions of aperture and points of view.  This is not always the case for many photographers, and certainly, not true of me years ago.  Confidence really only comes with experience.  Had I used a camera that I was less familiar with, or a different film stock that I was unsure about, a good photo might not have resulted.  big winds, big waves.  Nikon F3HP, HP-5.To people getting started in photography, and especially in using film, you should try keeping things simple until you understand the capabilities and limitations of the equipment and films that you are using.  It doesn't just end with the film stock, but how it's developed.  There are a lot of folks that would have had some great images, but screwed up in the film developing.  It's less likely to happen if you are consistent in your film, techniques, and developers.  Nikon F3HP, Lensbaby Velvet 56, HP-5Let me explain via my way of working.  I have owned my Nikon F3HP since 2008, and it's still in mint condition because I have certainly taken care with it.  While I have many other Nikon bodies, I'm very fond of the F3 because of the way it handles, and it's very dependable.  Because I wear glasses, I really appreciate the high-eyepoint prism and viewfinder.  So, I see pretty much all of what is going to be in the negative.  Second, the 35mm f/2 Nikkor has become my walk-around lens with this camera, and I know that the lens is going to render things perfectly.  I used Kentmere 100 and the HP-5+ because I like the results with those films, and I have always had good experiences with them in the developing tanks, plus they scan really well.  There have been times when I might try any number of odd films, but on a trip such as this one, I stayed with the tried and true to get the images I wanted.  Was I confident in my ability? Of course, I was.  When I ended up looking at the negatives,  and then the scans, I was really happy to see that everything came out the way I had envisioned.  Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Nikon F3HP, RPX25Now, to throw some uncertainty in -- I was also shooting with an Ansco Pix Panorama camera - a toy camera with a 2 element 28mm lens and a 13x36mm cropped frame. I had loaded it with Kentmere 100 - which on a sunny day is perfect, but in the days at the Outer Banks, I had only used it on cloudy days.  I didn't know if anything that I shot with it would be satisfactory.  But, that's one of the joys of using such cameras - any time things work out great with it, it's as if I have been given a gift.  I was confident in my choice of image framing, but to have satisfactory results was indeed, a great thing.  I also shot a roll of Lomochrome Purple in my Sprocket Rocket, which gives me a 24x72mm panoramic negative.  In this case, I really had no idea of how the images might appear, since it’s a strange film, and a pretty simple camera.  But then again, it’s always a bonus when those things work out.  One also has to be able to not over-think things and just let it play out. After I developed the film and scanned it in, it was apparent that while there were a handful of shots I really liked, that film isn’t the best for overcast days.Bodie Is. Lighthouse, Sprocket Rocket, Lomochrome PurpleBecoming a confident photographer is not always going to result in great images, because well, that’s the thing about photography.  Just when you think you are doing great, it’s always possible for the photo gods to thwart you with any number of things to mess you up - such as setting the camera at the highest shutter speed instead of A (for aperture priority) and not realizing it because you are so enamored with the scenes in front of you.  Forgetting what film was in the camera and using a red filter with a color film,  forgetting to change the ISO setting for the new roll of film, or realizing that after the 36th frame, that the film never got properly seated in the take-up spool, and you have been shooting blanks for the past hour.  Then of course, are the darkroom foibles.  The thing is, each of these missteps are bits of experience, and make one a more confident and more competent photographer.  If any photographer tells you that none of these things have ever happened to them, it’s quite possible that he or she is lying, or that they haven’t been doing it long enough.  My point is, becoming confident is achieved by using your tools every day, and keeping the process of photography simple.  I can say this, after 20+ years of serious photography-- that while trying different films and developers is perfectly okay, you’ll eventually decide on what films give you results consistent with your expectations.  Stick with them.  The same goes for cameras and lenses.  I’m a poor example of that aspect, but in my years of experience, it’s helped me to be able to know all about different cameras and films, because I do like to educate others about photography.  But in the end, I know exactly what gear that I’ll take to get the shots I want.  hunting cabin, Alligator River NWR, Nikon FE, Pro Image 100Having confidence in your equipment is important.  If you are starting out in photography, nothing is more discouraging than a camera that isn’t working properly.  There is a reason why a an SLR such as the Pentax K1000 has been recommended as a starter SLR - there are very few things that can go wrong, because the camera is so limited in its suite of controls - but it does have the basics.  A K1000 isn’t my favorite camera by any means, but one that works properly with a decent lens puts the basic elements of control - aperture, shutter speed, and focus at your fingertips.  You need only to compose and pick the best choice for exposure to make an image.  Use a bare-bones SLR and one or two film types for a year, and you’ll be amazed at how much better a photographer you are at the end of the year - and I mean use it every day, when possible  The same can be said for any camera, whether it is film or digital.  Use it with the same lens, and shoot almost every day, and see how you progress.  Moon Jellyfish, NC Aquarium, Nikon FE, Pro Image 100The world of photography is a huge umbrella, with all sorts of niche endeavors, types of equipment, digital and film, alt-process, hybrid workflows, and then types of subject matter.  You cannot possibly do it all, but whatever you do, become good at doing it.  Maybe it’s large format - which is something that I have never really had the patience for.  Maybe you are really into alternative processes, and all the best to you going down that rabbit hole, which is part alchemy and mastering the technical aspects.  I have respect for anyone that chooses to do things the hard way and can produce wonderful images.   That’s what I love about photography - there really is no \"best way\" - there are just ways that work for the person doing it.  For a long time it was considered that knowing and practicing the Zone System would lead you into producing better results.  I don’t think a lot of street photographers would agree with that, but if you want to use the Zone System, go for it.  There’s merit in knowing enough about it to at least understand it and applying the principles when it seems necessary.  However, millions of photographs have been made without ever thinking about the Zone System.   salt marsh and islands, Manteo, Nikon F3HP, HP-5Another interesting choice is not just the film size, but the aspect ratio of the images.  Square format (6x6) on 120 film is a favorite for many, but then there are those that prefer 6x7 or 6x9, or 6x17! Each of those negative sizes are different ways of seeing, and the same scene shot in each format has very different qualities.  You may find that you like square format the best, because you don’t have to worry about landscape vs portrait orientation.  Manteo marina, Nikon F3HP, Kentmere 100Every choice you make has an effect on the final image, from pre-visualization (if you do that), to camera, lens, film stock, filters, tripod or not, lighting, scene choice, and intangible factors such as mood (including yours, of course), intent of the photograph, and so on.  At some point, the factors that you can control become secondary to the point of the image.  It’s not that they don’t matter - but if you are a confident photographer, you hardly have to think about them, and instead think about the image.  worn dock, Manteo, Nikon F3HP, Kentmere 100Manteo, Nikon F3HP, Kentmere 100If you become confident in yourself and your gear, I think you’ll find that it becomes a lot more fun to go out and make images, and your results will also be more rewarding.  At it’s most basic level, photography is pretty simple. Don’t worry so much about gear - though it is important, but the most important tool in photography is located between the ears and behind the eyes.Nags Head Preserve, Nikon F3HP, Lensbaby Velvet 56, Kentmere 100"},
{"title": " Don’t Over-think!", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2023", "text": "For the past few weeks, I have been scanning in 35mm slides from the 1970s.  These are not found images from the antique store, but from my camera, from 1975-1980.  One of my goals this year is to scan all my slides (or at least the best ones) from my early days of photography, and in the process, remove the slides from the clear plastic sleeves in binders, and transfer to metal storage boxes.   My scanner, my trusty Epson V700, does an excellent job with scanning in these colorful little windows to the past, and much more efficiently than using a digital camera to transfer the analog into  a digital image.  Trust me on this, as I have been scanning slides and negatives in various formats for as many years as we have had scanners available.  I also have all the equipment I need to copy via a DSLR. The workflow and the results via the Epson V700 are superior.    The simple SLR that started me on my journeyOkay, let’s put the scanning aside, and have a conversation about the photographs, which is the real subject here.    My first 35mm camera was an Ihagee Exa 1a. Why?   As a gift for a teen interested in photography, it was possibly the cheapest new SLR available in 1974 from a NYC camera store, and I was thrilled with receiving it.    The downside with my Exa 1a is that it had a waist-level viewfinder, no meter, and a limited range of shutter speeds (1/30, 1/60, 1/125 and 1/175 sec. ).    In addition, the Meyer-Optic Domiplan 50mm f/2.8 lens is not what I would call a \"great lens.\"  It was obviously good enough for a teenager learning about photography.    My only photography guide was the Kodak Pocket Exposure Guide, which I still have.    I did not have an external meter.  So, as I learned to photograph with this camera, I relied on that Kodak Pocket Exposure Guide for my settings.    I shot b&w film, color print film, and transparencies.    fits in a back pocketAs I think back, I had to wonder why I shot slides so often after 1975, and my wife reminded me that it was probably the cost.    Believe me, the 70s were the last time a person with a low-income could live pretty well,  and I was a student with not much money.    As it turns out, it was cheaper to shoot slide film back then, as the film and processing was less expensive than color prints. I checked with a 1979 issue of Popular Photography, and the price to process and mount a 20 exposure roll of Ektachrome was less than $2.00, and the price of a roll of Ektachrome was probably around the same price. Some places offered a 20-exposure roll Ektachrome 64 for $3.65, including processing; about the same price as Kodachrome 64.  Since I was not in tune with the best offerings via mail (hey, no Internet then!!), I am pretty sure I purchased my film at the local drug store, Woolworth’s or K-Mart, and sent it out for processing.  In today’s dollars, that $3.65 translates to just less than $15.00, which would be pretty damn cheap now for a roll of film and processing!    Feb. 1975. The view from the house I grew up in, Parishville, NYEktachrome.In hindsight, I am happy that I chose to shoot the majority of my images on slides -- the colors have kept pretty well from those 1970s images, and because I didn’t have a lot of extra money, I didn’t shoot like I do now. However, it is also true that I was not a trained photographer with a plan.  In looking in these scanned images, I also realized one other thing - I did pretty damn well with the limited equipment that I owned, and my exposures were pretty much on target most of the time.  That means I used sunny-16 and intuition for all of my shots.    That brings up the title for this entry - \"Don’t Over-think.\" If I could use a really simple SLR nearly 50 years ago, with slide film, no meter, and 50mm f/2.8 lens, how is it that today, so many people are obsessed with the smallest details in exposures? I see newcomers to photography, especially film, needlessly obsessing over how much to adjust for a given exposure. While my Kodak Pocket Exposure Guide gave me the fundamentals, there is no absolute in photography.  Discerning the nuances in light and exposure, especially in landscapes, comes down to experience, but there is always the element of \"luck.\"  Maybe I was just lucky many times, and certainly cannot attribute my results to experience.  The thing is, I didn’t over-think what I was doing. I believe that over-thinking is what kills creativity and the moment. As I look over these images from 1975-1979, I certainly find ones that could have used more exposure -- and the Exa 1a had a limited number of shutter speeds, including B, and I did not own a tripod.  Perhaps if I’d been given a camera like a Praktica SLR with a prism and a full range of shutter speeds, I would have been even more on target, but there’s no way to know that now.  Feb. 1976, Syracuse Univ. dorms.

It was so bad we could skate on thesidewalks. Feb. 1976, Kodachrome 64When I replaced that Exa 1a with a Pentax MG in the early 1980s, I finally had a camera with an exposure meter -- but guess what?  Relying on that aperture-priority only camera also gave me some bad exposures, because I relied on the camera to get it right, instead of my intuition. Overall, it was a trade-off. Today, I am a much better photographer, and know when to adjust for a given lighting situation.  But still, in those spartan days of photography, my youth and  inexperience also allowed me to take a chance without worrying about failure. Sometimes I got it perfectly right, and sometimes I didn’t. For example, the photo taken at the SUNY ESF Woodsmen’s event in the fall of 1975 shows me that I wasn’t afraid to get close to the action - the couple on the 2-person crosscut saw with the wood chips flying towards the camera is captured pretty well. I’ll show some other examples with commentary, as well, but those old slides are also peeks back into the 70s of my college years.SUNY College of Environmental Science & Forestry fall Woodsmen'sBBQ in Tully, NY.  Oct. 1975, Ektachrome.October 1975, Chittenango falls, NY. Kodachrome 64Syracuse Univ. football game at the old Archbold Stadium,October 1975, Kodachrome 64.So, my advice for those folks getting into photography is to shoot what you know - and learn from it. You don’t have to travel to exotic places for great photographs - everyday activities and your immediate surroundings will mean much more the farther removed you are from them. As I look over these old shots, I realize that I was living in the moment, and photographing what was important to me at the time. I didn’t do it for posterity - though now those images have value in seeing people and places at another time, I did it for me.    Speaking of in the moment... Fall 1976, Syracuse, NY, EktachromeOverthinking your photography is a cruel blow to serendipity.    Be in the moment, trust your instincts, and don’t fret if your camera is one-stop off, or you don’t have the best lens money can buy, None of that matters.  People obsess over details that don’t matter in the long run.   If you have a photography exhibit, nobody will care what lens and camera you used, what film (if it was film), filter, or other attribute used to make the photograph. It’s all about the image. Algonquin Mountain summit, Adirondacks, NYSummer 1977, EktachromeIn high school, I wanted to be an entomologist, and that’s what I ended up becoming, and doing for 40 years. Nobody told me that I could have been a photographer - and had I taken photography seriously as a profession (which I never thought of), the 1970s would have been the most perfect time to be an aspiring photographer.    So, it was never my dream to be a photographer - I just enjoyed it. I look back at those images from the 70s and I am amazed that I did as well as I did with so little knowledge.    That's me, summer of 1977, in the Adirondacks.My camera, taken by my buddy, Dave Rosher. Ektachrome.January 1977, Twin Lakes, CT. Ektachrome.So, perhaps the lesson here is that not only should you not over-think it, but shoot for yourself.    Don't worry about what others might think.  All too often I see posts by people on places like Reddit (r/photography) who are unsure if they are good enough, or are afraid to take up photography because they lack knowledge.    You can’t get better without actually using your camera. Today’s digital and analog wonders will outperform what I used in the 70s by a huge margin. You already have tools at your disposal that will make a perfect exposure 90% of the time.  The part that makes the difference is YOU. Get out there and shoot everything that interests you, and over time you will discover what really motivates your photography, and what you enjoy the most. That’s the direction you’ll go."},
{"title": "Taking A Chance on a Yashica Electro 35 GTN", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2023", "text": "I recently received a Yashica Electro 35 GTN in a box of old cameras.    My usual reaction to the Electro 35 series has been \"meh.\" Going back over 20 years, I have seen far more non-working Electro 35 models than working ones. Part of that’s due to requiring the old 5.6V mercury batteries, sometimes bad electronics, and the PAD of death problem . In addition, I find that while I like aperture-priority, I also like to know what shutter speed the camera is using, and none of the Electro 35 series tell you the shutter speed.    This example of the GTN was lacking the Yashica badge - hence the missing square near the CdS meter opening.  The front upper edge of the filter ring is also bent, making a filter or lens hood unusable.    Taking a chance that the camera might be operable,  I ordered a battery adapter from the Yashica Guy on Etsy, and it came with the 4LR44 battery.    After that, I saw that the battery test button wasn’t working, but I decided to give it a try with a roll of Kentmere 100 film.  The camera’s shutter speeds obviously changed under different lighting conditions/apertures, so I figured that once I developed the film I would definitely know if it was working appropriately.    Battery adapter from the Yashica GuyAs you can see below, the film was exposed perfectly!    So, I have since reloaded the camera with Kentmere 400, and will see how that works.The Yashica Electro 35 GTN is the same camera as the GSN, but is black instead of chrome.  The 45mm f/1.7 Yashinon DX lens is certainly a very good lens, and in low light, the wide aperture is a bonus, considering that a lot of cameras from that era have an f/2.8 maximum aperture.   The camera can use films from ISO 25 to 1000, which covers most films that you can buy. It has a hot shoe so that you can attach a flash.  The shutter settings are B, Auto, and flash, and apertures range from f/1.7 to f/16.    The focus patch on the viewfinder is easily seen.  Overall, the Yashica Electro 35 GTN is certainly a pretty nice carry-around aperture-priority rangefinder camera. However, I wish that the ability to go completely manual with adjustable shutter speeds was an option. But, that doesn't stop it from being a great camera.I also have a nice Yashica Electro 35CC which is more compact than the large GTN/GSN models, and has a 35mm  f/1.8 lens, and I have used it quite a bit with excellent results.  Because the CdS light sensor on the 35 CC is within the front of the lens ring, I can use filters, and the camera will auto-adjust the exposure.  Comparing the two cameras, if I only could keep one, it would be the 35CC, which I have reviewed here.    The GSN is the chrome version of the GTNFinally, if you are interested in using any Yashica Electro 35, the GTN/GSN models are going to be the most likely candidates, as they can use a modern 6v battery with the adapter.    The big thing to watch, as I have previously stated, is whether the camera works properly after 50+ years.    I have seen some pristine-looking Yashica Electro 35s that just did not work, and I have seen some rather ratty-looking ones that work well.   There is no way to know until you test the camera.  So, if you are buying one from a seller, don’t pay a lot unless the camera is guaranteed to work properly.    While they only have aperture-priority exposure, the lens quality and ease of use makes them perfect for on-the-go photography.    I am not the world authority on the Yashica Electro 35 series, so take a look at the following links to learn more.  When these cameras were first introduced in 1966, they were considered quite advanced, due to the automated exposure system.   A later model, such as the Yashica MG-1, has a cheaper f/2.8 45mm lens and was introduced in 1975. Nonetheless, when working properly, the Yashica Electro 35 series delivers excellent results.A few tips:Without a battery, the default shutter speed is 1/500 sec. If you set the control to flash, the shutter speed is 1/30 sec.Make sure that you clean the battery compartment before testing.You can just pop in a roll of 400 ISO film w/out the battery and shoot at sunny-16Download a manual from butkus.orgUse a lens hood (55mm filter diam) to avoid flare on a sunny dayIf you use a filter, you’ll have to adjust the ISO setting by 1 or 2 stops to compensate, as the electric eye is not on the lens bezel.Some Recommended Links:Yashica Electro 35 - at camera-wikiThe Phoblographer Review of the GSNMatt’s Classic Cameras review of the GSNImaging Pixel review of the GTNJapan Vintage Camera video on the Yashica Electro series"},
{"title": " 2022 In Review", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2022", "text": "I haven’t done an end of year review in quite a while, and since I now keep pretty active journals, my task is easier.  Typically, a lot of folks like to review what happened in the photography world at large, but I’m going to confine my review to my own activities, which as things go, are relatively tame.  But bear with me, and hopefully, you’ll find some nuggets of wisdom.  As I went through my four journals spanning 2022, it’s gratifying to see that I have kept writing them.  I know that some people have one journal for an entire year, but I prefer them segmented, since losing one does not negate everything I have penned in. It also makes it easier to carry one along.  I’m a fan of the journals made by Denik.com, as I like the simple styling and 5x8” size.   Having the journal really helps me with recalling my activities and thoughts, and I wish that I’d been as compulsive about writing in one 20-30 years ago.  In my entry for 1/1/2022, I hoped to finish the toy camera (35mm) issue of Monochrome Mania, and produce 3 issues, including one on panoramas. Explore more of NC and take meaningful images.  All checked in as done!  2022 was the year that I discovered the writings of William Least Heat-Moon. Reading Blue Highways for the first time was revelatory - and I wish that I’d known of that book when it first came out in the early 1980s.  There are passages in Blue Highways that brought tears - not of sadness but of joy.  His descriptive prose really resonated with me, and since that book, I’ve managed to read his other tomes - Prairie Erth, Riverhorse, Roads to Quoz, Writing Blue Highways, and Here, There, Elsewhere.  If you are at all interested in traveling and stories about the land and people, I highly recommend Blue Highways and Riverhorse as places to start with his books.  This year, I made a lot of images with Pentax Spotmatics, aside from my Takumar Trek in late June.  There is just something about these cameras and their lenses that compels me to use them.  As M-42 mount cameras, they have their quirks, but the ease of use, smooth operation, and simplicity make Spotmatics quintessential photographic tools that keep on working for me.  In fact, I don’t think Pentax ever made better cameras than the Spotmatic F.  I’ve seen so many failing K-mount Pentax SLRs - mostly in the electronics, that I rank them low in durability.  If there is one Spotmatic I’d like to find and try out, it would be the Spotmatic ES.  Finding a working one seems to be the quest!  I have also been trying to find some nice pre-Spotmatic models, such as the Pentax HIII or SV.  They are meterless, yet very good, if I can get one that works as it should. The Heiland Pentax HIII- I've bought 2 of these on ebay, and neither one works properly -- maybe a CLA for one will do it. It is after all, over 50 years old.I stabilized my Nikon \"arsenal\" this year, paring it down to cameras that I use, and not ones sitting on a shelf.  The bodies that I have owned the longest are the FM2N and the F3HP, both gifted to me in mint condition in 2008.  I’ve been using the F3 a lot more of late, particularly because of the viewfinder, and it’s one smooth camera.  But my other bodies are: plain prism Nikon F from 1967, Nikon FE2, FM3A, FE10 (keep it in the car), FE black body, FA, N80, F100, F4, and F60.  Aside from the F, I have eliminated all non-AI bodies and most non-AI lenses from my collection.  As much as I love those Nikkormats, I can get along just fine without them.  The plain prism Nikon F is a thing of beauty and simplicity, and I’ve kept the 45mm f/2.8 Nikkor, 20mm f/3.5 Nikkor, 35mm f/2.8 Nikkor, and 50mm f/2 Nikkor just for that body.  With the 45mm pancake lens, it’s quite trim!A true gem of a camera.I tried out a few interesting cameras this year.  The Kodak Signet 40 was a real surprise, as it performed quite well and has earned a place in my heart.  I used a Contax IIa for the first time, and loved its precise rangefinder focus as well as the images I got from it.   I have my Leica M2, and Canon 7, so the Contax had a short stay -- but it is a wonderful camera, if you can find one.  I also tried out a Contaflex Super B SLR, and it was the first fully working example of a Contaflex that I’d used. However nice they are, I am still not a fan of lens-shutter SLRs.  Zeiss Ikon produced so many different cameras, that to be an expert on the brand would take many years.The M5 has been a great addition.This year, I also purchased a Canon EOS M5 mirrorless camera to replace the aging Nikon V1 that I bought a decade earlier.  I had briefly entertained a Nikon Z body, but the price on the M5 was really great (again, from KEH), and manual lenses for it from 7 Artisans, TT Artisans, etc., are really cheap and I love the results.  The M5 is certainly a very capable camera, and while it does not replace my usual gear, it’s a nice adjunct, and travels well.  This was the first year that I wrote reviews here on Random Camera Blog based on items sent to me by manufacturers/distributors.  Usually, I buy the items, but if anyone wants to send me something to review, I’m happy to do so!One of the things that makes me happy is finding a computer program that allows me to write without having to worry about menus, and can take up most of the space on my screen -- I don’t need to be distracted when I’m in writing mode.  Word Grinder on Linux and Windows is one such program, and I use it a lot to write these blog posts. However, more recently, I acquired a used 2008 MacBook for $50, and found this program called Bean - which is absolutely the best writing app I have used.  I love the larger font size, and using the MacBook has made me realize why I was such a big Mac fan/user for so many years.  I may just have to buy a newer MacBook Air in the coming year.  Speaking of acquisitions, I have high praise for the Canon Pixma Pro 200 printer that I purchased in 2021.  I have been making wonderful 12x18in. prints that I never would have made in the darkroom.  Printing panoramas has opened up a new creative path that I never would have attempted in my old wet darkroom. The ink economy of this printer amazes me, and even if I don’t use it for a month or two, it starts up and prints without a fuss.This year had me visiting the Film Photography Project in early May for 4 days to help with the unpacking, sorting, and examination of donations for the FPP school donation program.  The mountains of boxes gradually diminished while I was there, but as soon as I leave, I know that they’ll build back up again.  John Fedele is a great help, and I wish that I lived a bit closer to NJ to help out more often.  Being a small part of the FPP has been rewarding, and has really made me a lot of friends in the film community.John Fedele, shot with the Contax IIa.Camera Heritage Museum, Staunton, VAOn the way to NJ, I stopped in Staunton, VA, in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, and visited the Camera Heritage Museum, which I have already written about.  It’s an overwhelming place, and like all of these small camera museums, are pretty much the work of one person over many decades of collecting.  I think of the late Jack Naylor in Boston who amassed an amazing and quite valuable collection of photographica, and after his death in 2007, much of it was auctioned off for about 2 million dollars.  His collection’s scope was world-wide, and contained many unique items.   A collection is not a museum - it requires people to curate, conserve, preserve, and properly exhibit with interpretive displays, as well as make it available to researchers.  It also requires money to guarantee that it runs in perpetuity (or at least close to it), so that the collections are not dispersed to the winds after the principal collector(s) have passed away.  That’s why museums should be in the public trust - for example, the Smithsonian. So, while I appreciate these private photography museums, the long-term outlook for them is not great.  I suppose the model to be used might be like that of the Argus Museum in Ann Arbor, MI which started out as a private collection (which I evaluated), and subsequently was given to the county historical society, and is now in good shape to continue into the future.  Natural Bridge, VA.  Nikon F3HP, Kentmere 400The Shenandoah Valley was again a target in September, when I spent a few days in Lexington, VA.  I had wanted to explore more of it, being a fan of Sally Mann’s work, and the visit gave me the opportunity to absorb the history and beauty of Rockbridge County.  A return visit is definitely in the works in the coming year.  If you do nothing else there, visit Natural Bridge State Park - as the limestone arch is really impressive - and yes, it IS a bridge which US-11 travels over.  It’s also the reason Rockbridge County has that name.The Gin Hotel, formerly the Robert E. Lee, Lexington, VAProposed Cover for a a photo bookMy Takumar Trek in June, has already been written up here, and I continue to plan for another trek along US-23 to finish up the southern leg, which ends up in Jacksonville, FL.  I need only to finish the NC, GA, and FL segment to have traveled and photographed along its length.  It was also in late June that I participated in Photostock, held this year in Cross Village, MI - about 30 minutes from Mackinac City. If you have never been to a Photostock meetup, I highly suggest it.  When I lived in Michigan, it was a leisurely drive from my home in Ann Arbor to Harbor Springs, and they were always a great time, invigorating, and got the creative juices flowing.  There are so many talented photographers at Photostock, and egos are checked at the door.  It’s a wonderful time to learn new things, meet old friends, and make new ones.A scene from Photostock 2022One of the things that I wanted to do this year was to try out a 6x9 Fujica camera. Those “Texas Leicas” used to sell for $250 before the prices started to rise up.  I wish that I’d bought one a decade ago.  However, I found a nice Fujica GL690 body at KEH for around $400.  Without a lens.  One of my Instagram contacts offered me a free lens for it, but it needed repair.  Well, I got the lens and then spent about $200 to have it repaired.  So, once that all worked out, I started using the Fujica GL690, and am quite happy with the results. It does take some time to get used to using a large rangefinder camera and get comfortable with it.  None of those cameras have internal meters, so basically it’s a pretty simple camera - but with really large negatives at the same 2:3 perspective as a 35mm frame.  I made a 12x18 print from it and it just blows me away.  So, 2023 will see it getting a lot more use.  This camera will see a lot of use in 2023In late August, I contracted COVID from someone that was visiting us for a weekend. That was a week of my life that I will never get back, and thankfully, I had already had my vaccine and boosters.  I just cannot imagine how awful it is for an unvaccinated person. It really was more like 2 weeks until I felt perfectly normal again.I have been doing a lot of scanning of old negatives and slides this year. I had not scanned in any of the negatives from my 2003 trip to NM, and I found so many wonderful images among the new scans.  I think that the more removed we are from the event, the more meaningful the images.  What I did realize, though, is that while I started a journal for the trip, I stopped after 3 days.  It’s takes some discipline to write everything down each day, and I failed that -- so nearly 20 years later, I had to extrapolate the timeline of the photographs from the trip after day 3.  Lesson learned.   Eventually, all of my old slides will be scanned in, dating from the mid-70s to the 2000s, removed from their clear storage pages, and transferred to metal slide-storage boxes.  Each box will have a thumb drive of the scans.   They’ll probably all be trashed someday, but I will leave that decision to whomever survives me.In mid-October, Bill Pivetta and I drove out to Durham, NC to see the Vivian Maier exhibit that was part of the Click! Photofest in Raleigh-Durham.  That nearly month-long event is rather amorphous, as exhibitions and events take place in many locations.  I’d certainly like to do more at the festival, but I would need to stay a few nights in the area to make it really worthwhile.  It was a nice introduction to Durham, and the Vivian Maier exhibit was certainly worth the 4 hr drive each way!  Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Outer banksIn early November, Adrienne, Beverley, and I went to Manteo, NC and the Outer Banks for 4 nights.  It was a great time to visit, and the weather was really fantastic, except for the last full day, when there were winds with gusts up to 50 mph -- it was a perfect time to see the Atlantic with some fury to it.  The only thing was the salt spray on my gear.  I made sure to use a UV filter on the front of my lenses, and after we returned, I wiped my F3 down with a wet cloth and removed any lingering deposits.  It’s a 7-8 hr drive from our place in the mountains to the Outer Banks, so not exactly a weekend trip, but I’d like to go again and stay somewhere near Ocracoke to do more photography.  I think the Holga and the Horizon 202 would get some use there.Bodie Island Lighthouse, Ansco Pix PanoramaAfter going through a lot of film this year, it’s obvious that my most-used films were: Kentmere 400, Kentmere 100, Ilford HP-5, and Eastman 5231.  Anything else was a few rolls, at best.  I shot very little color film, but I do have a pretty good stockpile of C-41 film in my fridge. It’s no secret that I’m a monochrome maniac, and speaking of that, the final issue for 2022 of Monochrome Mania is all about images from the Ansco Pix Panorama.  Having three other very talented photographers - Derek Keaton, Eben Ostby, and Liz Potter made it a first venture into a collaborative issue of my zine, which I hope to repeat for late 2023.  Three issues per year for 3 years straight is making me quite pleased. Issue 10 is already in the works, and will probably be available in February.Podcasts are what I like to listen to while developing film - and my favorite podcast (that’s not the one I’m in) is still All Through A Lens.  Eric and Vania do an amazing job putting together well-researched and informative - and entertaining episodes that really keep my attention.  If you have not listened to All Through A Lens, I highly recommend that you do. My second favorite podcast is I Dream of Cameras, and Jeff and Gabe really hit my camera gear buttons in their lively presentations.  If there are any two people that I’d want to meet at a camera swap, it would be them.  Best wishes to you all for the coming year.  May you find creativity, joy, good fortune, and good health.  From the Blue Ridge Parkway, Canon EOS M5"},
{"title": " Solving a Found Film Mystery", "date": "Monday, December 26, 2022", "text": "Christmas in Detroit, 1948.  Shot with a Kodak Bantam Special on Kodachrome, ASA10.  I am pretty sure that a flash was used here.In 2018, I ended up with a small box of found film that my now-deceased friend, Marc Akeman had picked up at a Detroit area estate sale a few years earlier. Marc was always adept at finding estate sales and auctions and buying box lots of photographic items that eventually ended up in his basement. After his death in 2018, I spent some time organizing his photo gear estate for his family, and it wasn't until then that I realized he had hoarder tendencies.  I imagine that he intended to do something with all of the found negatives, slides, and prints that were still in the boxes he purchased them in, but he never had the chance.  I sorted out out a few things from one of the boxes - Kodachrome slides, black and white negatives, and some rolled up developed films, since it was obvious that they had a Detroit mailing address, and were from before 1950.  I'm always keen to see old Kodachromes, and I could see that there were quite a few boxes in the lot.Of course, in my own life, I was preparing for a move to North Carolina, leaving Ann Arbor behind after 38 years, since my wife and I had retired from the Univ. Michigan.  Those finds via Marc went into a small box labeled \"Found Film\" and it was not until recently that I started going through a few of them.  Aside from one roll of medium format black and white negatives definitely of the NSFW genre, the remaining images are of post-war middle class Detroit family life, 1947-49.  Same Christmas tree as aboveI scanned in a Kodachrome slide for a Christmas-theme Instagram post, and realized that it was shot on 828, or Bantam film.  I was curious if the photographer had used a Kodak Bantam Special for the Kodachromes (Bantam film gives only 8 exposures on a roll), as the images were far better than a cheap bantam camera. Tonight, I was going through the earlier b&w scans, and voila! There were several black and white shots of his Kodak Bantam Special in a chair.  So, I found the camera that the photographer used.  I don't know what he used for the medium format, but they are 6x9 cm, so very likely a folding Kodak of some sort.Still-life with Bantam Special.I'm posting several of these b&w images along with the Kodachrome slide.  I'll eventually scan the other slides, but I may end up using a DSLR since the slide carroer for the Epson V700 crops out part of the image. The Bantam slides are larger than standard 35mm, even though they are in 2x2 slide holders.  All of the b&w images are from medium-format negatives.Photographer's father?  Detroit News, Jan 17, 1949Musical familyFinally, here is a wonderful example of the Kodak Bantam Special, photographed by me.It's really too bad Kodak didn't make this a 35mm camera. It's design, by Walter Dorwin Teague, is an Art Deco wonder, and if you can respool 35mm with an 828 backing paper, you can still make use of it."},
{"title": "Kodak's Signet 40 camera", "date": "Friday, December 16, 2022", "text": "I’ll be honest up front - In my opinion, most of Kodak’s 1950s 35mm cameras not named Retina are fairly basic cameras with Bakelite and aluminum bodies.  While the Pony 135 and its variants were aimed at the occasional photographer, and at a lower price point, the Retinas were high-end cameras  demanding a higher price (see my previous post on Kodak’s Retinas).  The middle ground in post-war America was taken by the Kodak Signet series, with more user-friendly features, good optics, and attractive looks.  If your main US-based competition in mid-50s America is Argus, then it should have been a no-brainer for a large company like Kodak to challenge the popular Argus C-3 which has the ergonomics of a brick, or the more friendly-looking Argus C-4.  The Signet 35 first appeared in 1953, and while an attractive camera, it also looks a like the Kodak Chevron, a medium-format 6x6 rangefinder camera.   The Signet 35 advanced the film with a winding knob, much like the Pony models, and the Argus C-4.  The Signet 40 was introduced the year I was born - 1956, and is a more streamlined camera - with almost Art Moderne-like styling (think of diners).  The Signet 40 features a 46mm f/3.5 Ektanon lens (3 elements), Kodak Synchro 400 shutter, with B, and 1/5-1/400 sec speeds.  The aperture range is f/3.5-f/22.  Focus is from 2 feet to infinity. The triangular rangefinder spot is bright, and there is no protruding eyepiece to scratch your glasses.  The camera back is hinged, and film insertion and operations go very smoothly.  There is a film reminder dial on the top deck, but since there is no meter in this camera, you must use a separate light meter.  There is no accessory shoe on the top, but there are side attachment points for a Kodak flashbulb holder. This was the mid-1950s, and it would be a while before manufacturers adopted universal flash attachments, such as the PC (Prontor-Compur) flash connector, and the ISO-standard hot shoe, not to mention Xenon-strobe flash units (X-synch).  My Signet 40 came from FPP listener Tom Frost in Vermont, who sent me the camera after I made disparaging remarks about the Signet series, and figured that I should actually try one.  In my experience, I had rarely come across Signets that were working. In fact, I found a comment of mine on Flickr from 2010 stating that I had seen very few working Signets!  It could have been for a variety of reasons that the cameras I saw had problems - design/construction flaws, hard use, and age may have been factors.  Rick Oleson, a long-time camera tinkerer and photographer, found that it was the rapid-wind lever that is suspect over time, as it may free-wheel if you advance the film too fast.  So, my advice is to wind the film slowly with the  lever.  The Signet 40 that I received looked like a brand-new camera.  Tom had beautifully restored the camera to its like-new appearance and functionality.  It was in its leather case, and since the body has strap lugs (yay!), it does not need to reside in the case to go shooting with it.  As a mid-century US-made camera, the Signet 40 is classy-looking, and has a very different appearance from the Argus rangefinders where all the linkages are external.  You still need to cock the shutter tensioning when ready to take a photo.  You can take double-exposures if you release the shutter lock on the front of the bottom plate of the Signet 40 body.  The Signet 40 isn’t just a step above the Pony series, it’s a step above the Argus cameras of the same vintage.  So, what did this camera sell for in its day?  It sold from 1956-59 for $65.  In today’s dollars that would be $711.  It was definitely more expensive than an Argus C-3 but cheaper than the C-4, which sold for $84 with a clip-on meter.  Obviously, the Signet series was aimed at middle-class Americans that could afford it.  To compare to the Pony 135 series, it was $30 more expensive than a Pony 135 of the same vintage.  There are several other very good reviews on the Signets:mikeeckman.comJim Grey's blogChris's Camera PagesMike Elek's collectionAs for later models of Signets, such as the Signet 30, Signet 50, and Signet 80, they adopted the top-mounted accessory shoe, a single-stoke film advance lever, and in the Signet 50 and 80 models, a light meter, and in the 80, interchangeable lenses.  None of the latter models had the clean styling of the Signet 40, instead adopting a more bulky look with stepped up viewfinders, expanded front sections, etc.  Aesthetically, the Signet 40 has a more polished and minimalist look than the Signet 35 that preceded it.  The Signet 80 looks more like an Argus!After Kodak released the Kodapak 126 cartridge and Instamatics in 1963, Kodak’s 35mm cameras were either Retinas and Retinettes, made in Stuttgart Germany, or the US-made Automatic 35 and Motormatic 35 camera series, and were around the $100 mark. By the late 1960s, Kodak's 35mm cameras were gone, and by the late 1980s Kodak once again marketed 35mm cameras.  Of course, within a decade of releasing the Signet 40, the onslaught of excellent 35mm cameras from Japan had started, and the US camera manufacturers and many German ones were headed to extinction.  My experience with the Signet 40 has been very good.  It’s definitely a more refined camera than the Argus offerings, and not as overbuilt as those Zeiss Ikon models such as the Symbolica or the Balda  Baldessa 1a (a review will be forthcoming for that one, too).   It still has the less-advanced method of manual shutter cocking, but that can be an asset if you want multiple exposures.  In use, the Signet 40 handles well, and I found a lens shade that mates with the filter ring (series V) perfectly.  I have shot several rolls of film with it so far, and will continue to bring it along on various trips.  It remains one of the most attractive of Kodak's cameras.Some examples from the cameraFuji Superia 200Kodak 2238 at  ISO 25"},
{"title": "Building a lens collection", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2022", "text": "My prime lenses for my Spotmatic cameras. M-42 Super Takumars - 17mm, 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, 105mm, 135mm, 200mm, 100mm macro, 55mm macro (non Pentax)When I first started getting serious about photography, I owned a Pentax ME, a 50mm f/2 Pentax M lens, and a Pentax 135mm f/2.8 short telephoto and a 2x teleconverter. That was before the millenium! I used that camera and the two lenses (oh yes, as well as the TC) for 17 years, until I started on my photographic journey 22 years ago.  Despite the limitations, I did okay with what I had, but after I acquired a used 28-80mm Pentax zoom in 2000, I saw how much more I could do with that particular lens. I’ve already described in my previous post, how I have decided that the 35mm focal length has become my choice for the normal lens. But this post is not about a particular focal length. There certainly is something to be said for using a particular lens for all of your photography. If you only use a twin lens reflex, then the 75 or 80mm permanently affixed to your camera is the only lens you need. Or perhaps you have a fixed lens 35mm camera such as a Canonet QL-17 or Yashica Electro 35.  If a fixed-lens camera is all you need for whatever photographic work that you do, then the rest of this post won’t be as useful to you. A great many photographers excelled with nothing more than a Leica with a 50mm lens. However, if you have an SLR of any sort, then you have very likely considered using other lenses with it besides whatever came with the camera. For many years, a 50mm normal lens accompanied most SLR cameras.Back when magazines like Shutterbug and Popular Photography were well, popular, I would peruse the back pages to look at the ads from places like 47th Street Photo, and see all those inexpensive Spiratone lenses, or new/used stuff from Adorama or B&H. Digital had not yet taken over photography, and even used lenses were still not \"cheap.\" It was a time when camera swaps/shows were still common, and eBay had not achieved its preeminence in the used marketplace. Lens reviews on youTube were unavailable, as that had not even been invented yet. So, one relied on camera magazine reviews or books, or word of mouth about any particular lens before plunking down some cash.  Today, the price of lenses on the used market can bring all sorts of bargains to your door without even leaving your house. Whether you buy from a reputable seller like KEH, or go the eBay route, or a (gasp!) camera store, many lenses (except those with the word Leitz imprinted on them) are a fraction of the price they originally sold for. No matter what SLR platform you use, you can now acquire a stable of lenses for a few hundred dollars that will last a lifetime.Spiratone ad from 1966 U.S. CameraWhy more than one lens? If you are using a 35mm SLR, a single lens will limit your ability to make the most of the format and capabilities of the camera body. From fish-eye to normal, to super telephoto, to ultra macro, a 35mm SLR can do many things, and different lenses allow you to explore and create images that you cannot get any other way. Depending on the SLR body, you’ll find just about every kind of lens imaginable - and where to start? If a \"new\" camera can be a thing that gets your creative juices going, imagine how much a \"new\" lens can change your photography. Sometimes, a different focal length can be just the thing to make you see things anew. For example, if you have never used a 200mm macro lens, or a 24mm wide-angle, just putting on a such a lens will open new worlds to you. I’m not suggesting that you buy more lenses willy-nilly, just to \"have them all,\" but to have a set of lenses that will provide the kind of tools that you need for most of your photography. You can always rent a lens to determine if you really need it, or if you need it just for a special project. A lot of pros rent lenses just for a special need.   To be more precise, what lenses do you need? Since not everyone has the same needs, you will have to figure that one out for yourself. However, I’ll start with a series of lens types, and you can go from there.The Helios 44-M 58mm f/2 - a great lens for its specific propertiesAlthough I am primarily a Nikon user, my experience over the years with just about every SLR system made has convinced me that most of Nikon’s bodies remain the best constructed, and most reliable with age. Minolta made excellent glass, but their SLR bodies have not aged well. Pentax has a bad track record with their electronic bodies (such as the ME), and nothing they have made since after the Spotmatic days has really aged as well as the Spotmatics. The vaunted K1000 may be fine - as long as it wasn’t made in China at the end of the run for that model.   Canon, with its various mounts - FL, FD, EOS, produced good lenses, but the bodies ran second-fiddle to Nikon. It was not until the EOS system that Canon was on par with whatever Nikon glass and bodies were produced, and it vaulted past Nikon because of the EOS Rebel. However, the bad news is that many of those old EOS bodies have shutters that are getting gooey with age, so you have to look out for that. Olympus OM-series glass is also fantastic, and many of the OM series bodies continue to work pretty well. The other SLR manufacturers - Mamiya, Exakta, Topcon, Rollei, Miranda, Zeiss Ikon, and yes, even Leitz do not have the lens offerings that Nikon and Canon produced. However, within those other systems are notable lenses, all with their own unique characteristics. Over the years, I have used many, many lenses, and sold some that I now regret. I’ve also gotten rid of lenses that were definitely not so great.   So, no matter what 35mm SLR system you are using - I’m not going to delve into rangefinders or medium format - there will always be a lot of choices one might make in the lenses that they use.   In addition, modern DSLRs are sold with kit zoom lenses, and for many beginners, a zoom makes a great choice, because you only need to carry around a single lens, maybe two, for a lot of photography. Some photographers prefer prime lenses, some prefer zooms, some prefer wide-angle zooms over telephoto zooms, etc. No single lens can be expected to do everything, though in the days before auto-focus, a 50mm lens was considered the every-day do-it-all lens, with your feet becoming the zoom. With a prime lens, your feet do the \"zooming.\"Lens selection really depends on what you photograph and your working methodology. There are some street photographers that use only a 28mm lens, others that feel that the 35mm focal length is their forte, and some that like a longer lens to close the distance - say, 85mm. Landscape photographers may like the 20-24mm end and the 300mm end. It really is a very personal choice, and most of us get a lens that we think we’ll use for a given purpose. I happen to like Lensbaby lenses, so of course, I have three different models, each with its own characteristics.Lensbaby lensesSince I do love prime lenses, I have a suite of primes - some that I use often, others that have only special uses. I also have various zoom lenses, and I’ll discuss what I use and why.PRIME LENSESPrimes are single focal length lenses - 16mm, 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 55mm, 85mm, 90mm, 105mm, 135mm, 180mm, 200mm, etc. Primes go from fisheye to long telephotos, but most of the primes I see in use are in the 24-135mm range. I consider 24mm the best alternative to a slightly less-wide 28mm. However, 28mm lenses typically have less distortion than anything wider. In my own inventory, I have 16mm, 17mm, 19mm, 20mm, 24mm, and 28mm wide-angle primes. If I have to choose what to take in one bag, I almost always choose the 28mm. You can't go wrong with this one.or its manual version35-58mm are the \"normal\" lenses, and there’s a ton of them. If I’m not carrying a 35mm f/2, I am probably using a 50mm f/1.4 The number of 50mm-ish lenses out there are staggering, and for good reason. Not all 50mm lenses are equal, and some have far different and pleasing bokeh than others. You don’t need a high-priced Zeiss lens on your Nikon to take great images -- the modest 50mm f/2 Nikkor is one of the best lenses ever made for 35mm cameras. But even within that \"normal lens\" genre are legendary optics among SLRs. The 58mm f/1.4 Minolta PF Rokkor is a lens that you should have if you are using manual Minolta SLRs. The 45mm f/2 MD Rokkor is a great pancake lens. If you are shooting with Olympus, then of course, that 50mm f/1.4 Zuiko lens is a sweet one. With Canon FD mount - the 50mm f/1.4 is also a favorite, but that 50mm f/1.8 is also excellent. In the screw-mount M-42 world, there are lots of great normal lenses aside from the 50mm f/1.4 SMC Takumar. I’ll bet there are more varieties of 50mm M-42 mount lenses than any other lens mount. There is a lot of love for the 58mm f/2 Helios 44 from Zenit - and there are several iterations of that, from the early pre-set versions to more modern auto-diaphragm versions. I could probably make a list of some of the \"best\" nifty-fifties in M-42 mount, but that’s an article all by itself.   Tamron Adaptall-2 17mm lensBack in the old days, you bought an SLR and it most likely came with a 50mm lens, and that’s the one that you used the most. Today, lenses that were too expensive for many of us back then are sold for a fraction of what they are really worth. But even then, there were budget brands like Spiratone (the most affordable), Vivitar, Albinar, Tokina, Tamron, Makinon, Promaster and others.   Of those brands, there are some gems in the Vivitar line that were made by Kiron, and I don’t think people today appreciate the longevity of many Tamron Adaptall-2 lenses. Change your camera system? Just get a new Adaptall-2 adapter for the lens. The Tamron 90mm Macro has had several iterations, but the last manual version is the best.   Now, you can buy on eBay pretty much any Tamron or Vivitar lens ever made for a fraction of what they originally sold for. With the advent of autofocus SLRs and then the DSLR explosion, zoom lenses became the norm for most photographers, and the typical zoom for a kit was something in the range of 28-80mm. That range covers many photographic needs, but also at a cost of being slower, with a smaller maximum aperture, and a variable one at that. Typically, a variable aperture zoom of 28-80 equivalent would be f/3.5-5.6. Meanwhile, a 50mm f/1.4 becomes a game-changer for someone that’s only used a slow zoom! So, as the market has evolved, we are seeing really expensive niche AF lenses for DSLRs and mirrorless systems - lenses that often negate the smaller mirrorless body advantage. At the same time, there are many new manual lenses coming from Chinese manufacturers (7Artisans, TTArtisans, and others) that bring back the simplicity and advantages of fast prime lenses at an amazing low cost to consumers. Mirror LensesNikon 500mm mirror lensfront view of the 500mm NikkorA T-mount 500mm mirror lensCatadioptric, or mirror lenses are yet another attempt to make a low-cost high-magnification telephoto. Using a system of mirrors and refracting lens elements, they are similar to a Cassegrain astronomical telescope. A 500mm f/8 mirror lens doesn’t weigh much, doesn’t cost much, and doesn’t get used much. If you get one, you’ll probably play around with it for a bit until you realize the images generally are not great. The donut-shaped circles of confusion are not attractive. One good use for these lenses would be photographing the moon. Just about every major camera manufacturer made a mirror lens, some with 1000mm focal lengths. Today, new ones are usually T-mount, meaning you’ll need the proper adapter for your SLR system. In addition, with no electronic contacts, you will need to use one in manual or aperture-priority mode. Since they are more compact and lightweight than the equivalent all-glass lens, they are easy to carry and if you like the results, well, good for you. Used mirror lenses generally are inexpensive on eBay, and if you buy one that is a T-mount, make sure that you have the right adapter for your SLR.Macro LensesVivitar Series 1 90mm macro lens with 1:1 adapterMacrophotography is another world of special lenses. While many zoom lenses have a \"macro\" setting, it’s just close-up photography, and not true macro. Macrophotography is typically making something life-size on the frame (1:1), or larger than life size. A true macro lens will have 1:2 or 1:1 on the lens barrel to indicate that. Depending on your SLR system, macro lenses are almost invariably more expensive than normal lenses of similar focal lengths. Since I use Nikon most of the time, I am familiar with what has been available for the F-mount over the years. I’m not going to cover modern lenses made for DSLRs or mirrorless systems. However, the older classic lenses still work great with film, and in most cases, digital bodies. My all-time favorite is the 90mm Tamron macro lens. It’s had several iterations as an Adaptall-2 lens, as well as mount-specific AF versions. 90 mm f/2.5 Tele-Macro with 49mm filter diam. - the earliest version, 1:2 without an extension tube or diopter.90mm f/2.5 Tamron SP with 55mm filter ring, 1:2, 1:1 with matching extension tube. I have had this lens for over 20 years, and with the adaptall-2 mount, it has been used on various SLR systems.90mm f/2.8 Tamron SP AF Macro. 1:1. The filter ring is 55mm, and at 1:1 the closest focus distance is just under foot. 90mm f/2.8 Tamron SP Di. The latest version of this lens, presumable optimized for digital SLRs, it still does exactly the same as the previous version, but seems less plasticky-looking and operates more quietly.Nikon's 55/2.8, 55/3.5/105/4 and 200/4 macro lensesThe most common macro lens for Nikon is the 55mm f/3.5 Micro-Nikkor, which was produced virtually unchanged, for both non-AI and AI versions. With the matched M-ring, an extension tube made especially for that lens, you get 1:1 reproduction, otherwise, it’s 1:2. That lens was replaced by the 55mm f/2.8. However, that lens has a reputation for some batches being nearly unusable over time due to the helicoid seizing up. I have seen many of them in various degrees of stiff focus, to being nearly unusable. A trip to a repair technician can cure the problem. If you have one that focuses smoothly, it’s a great lens that can be used as a general purpose normal lens as well as a macro lens. The PK-13 Nikon extension tube is used to bring it to 1:1 reproduction. One lens that is also a favorite, but I have not owned in a long time is the 60mm f/2.8 AF-D Micro-Nikkor. It focuses from infinity to 1:1 on its own. It’s very likely the best Micro-Nikkor made, and whether on a film or digital body, it gives great results. I used that lens quite a lot in my work in the Museum of Zoology at the Univ. of Michigan. Next, is the 105mm f/4 Micro-Nikkor, which has had several iterations, but because of its longer focal length, provides a better working distance (subject to lens) than the 55mm Micro-Nikkor. Without the PN-1 extension tube, it provides 1:2 magnification, and 1:1 with it. It has a built-in lens shade, and a 52mm filter ring. To be honest, I prefer the Tamron 90 over this lens, but it can be a general-purpose short tele as well as a macro lens. There is a newer version 105mm f/2.8 Micro-Nikkor, which is reputed to be a much better lens, but I have no experience with it. The 200mm f/4 Micro-Nikkor is a lens that I’ve had for 20 years, and it’s different from the other macro lenses listed here because the lens barrel length does not change while focusing, as the internal elements move, so it’s called an IF lens (internal focus). Without an extension tube, it goes to 1:2, with a working distance of 20 inches. It’s a great lens for a lot of larger insects, flowers, nature, etc., and yet it is also a very good 200mm telephoto.   Add an extension tube or diopter, and of course, you get greater magnification. With the f/4 maximum aperture, it’s a versatile lens and easily hand-held. Minolta macro lenses are among the best.There are other single-length macro lenses out there for just about every SLR system, and while a 50mm macro lens is going to be the most common, I suggest looking for the Tamron 90mm Adaptall-2, since you can find an adapter to use it with just about any 35mm SLR system. With that maximum f/2.5 aperture, you have a macro lens, a portrait lens, and a short tele. For greater magnification, you can use extension tubes or a bellows, and there is a whole world of special lighting, clamps, and lenses for extreme macrophotography, that is beyond the scope of this post.Go WiiiiideWide-angle lenses are sort of niche, in the sense that REALLY wide lenses go all the way to fish-eye lenses. A semi-fisheye lens will have barrel distortion, and a full fish-eye lens will be a full circle on the film (or sensor) plane. Fish-eye lenses have their use, but in my opinion, they can easily be over-used because of the novelty. Really wide lenses such as 16mm can be pricey, and of course, will distort the image. I have found that the 19mm Vivitar f/3.5 wide-angle is one of the better wides available in any mount. It’s almost pancake-like. Next would be 20mm, and there I have some favorites. The 20mm f/3.5 Nikkor-UD with a 72mm filter ring is a non-AI lens is truly great. It’s worth getting one converted to AI-mount if you can. However, if you have a Nikon FM, FE, or F3, you can release the metering tab on the body and use the non-AI lens in stop-down mode. I use mine on my plain-prism Nikon F and really enjoy that combination.The well-regarded Canon 24mm f/2.8Four different Nikon 28mm lensesSix different 28mm M-42 mount lensesThe Vivitar 28mm f/2.5, shown in M-42 and Nikon F-mount. One of the best third-party 28mm lenses.However, the 20mm f/2.8 AF-D lens is certainly an excellent lens that is a lot of fun to use, and I recommend it for anyone using an AF Nikon. It’s 62mm filter thread is certainly easier to deal with than the monster 20mm non-AI lens. A 24mm lens in any mount will be a very good choice for a lot of wide-angle photography. Of course, the various 24mm Nikkor lenses are my first choice, but I have used the 24mm f/3.5 Super Takumar, and it’s a very good lens on my Spotmatics. Although 28mm lenses are common as can be in most SLR systems, don’t knock them. A 28mm lens will often surprise you with the lack of distortion, and if you are just starting out, it’s one of the focal lengths that I think belongs in everyone’s bag of prime lenses. If you are looking at M-42 mount lenses, there are many 28mm lenses available - most of them pretty good.Telephoto LensesThe excellent Canon 85mm f/1.8 portrait lensIt seems that everyone thinks 85mm is a portrait lens on 35mm SLRs, and they would be right. The little extra reach allows you some space between you and the subject, and since many 85mm lenses have wide apertures of f/2 or larger, you can have shallow depth of field, dropping out the background. However, it’s not the only focal length to consider for portraits - 90mm (as in the Tamron lens mentioned previously) and 105mm are also considered to be good for portraits, and in 105mm, there are a lot of choices across the many lens mounts. Yes, the Nikon 105mm f/2.5 Nikkor is a favorite, but so is the SMC Takumar 105mm f/2.8 lens, which by the way, is about half the weight of the Nikkor lens. There is also a 100mm f/2.8 Series E Nikon lens, which ain’t bad. All of these lenses should be used with a lens hood to keep extraneous light away from the front element. Many photographers use the 105mm lenses with extension tubes for close-up photography, and the 105mm Nikkor was a staple for a lot of nature photographers. The shallow depth of field at f/2.5 again works well to isolate the subject from the background, as does the focal length. 135mm lenses - Nikon, Olympus, Pentax M-42, Minolta MDNow, I’ll discuss the orphan lens of the 1970s and 80s, the 135mm telephoto. At one time, the 135mm lens was almost always in a camera bag, often with a 2x teleconverter (a short magnifying lens that couples to the back of the 135). They were the the most affordable telephotos, as short as they were, and were really common in T-mount with an adapter to fit your camera mount. A 135 mm/2.8 with a 2x teleconverter basically gave you a 270mm f/5.6 lens.  Today, 135mm lenses tend to be overlooked, but among them are ones that are bokeh monsters - especially those lenses that were pre-set with a maximum f/2.8 or f/3.5 aperture. (See my post on pre-set lenses). These were low-cost lenses labelled as Spiratone, Vivitar, Soligor and others. They are compact, cheap, and the multi-bladed apertures are circular. I highly recommend them if you are looking for something a little different. Otherwise, all the SLR manufacturers sold perfectly good 135mm lenses, usually either with f/3.5 or f/2.8 maximum apertures. Some focus closer than others, and yes, they can be used for portraiture as well as landscapes. The Nikon 180mm f/2.8 ED telephoto is a great manual lens that is tack sharp, and yet could also be use for fashion photography and landscapes. I once had one, but found that I rarely used it, so I sold it. I should have kept it! 200mm telephotos are plentiful and inexpensive today. Aside from the common Nikon versions, there are many to choose from in M-42 mount, some a bit faster at f/3.5, but f/4 is the typical maximum aperture. The 200mm f/4 Super Takumar is an excellent lens. Just about every SLR system has a 200mm prime lens, and of course, there are many third-party options available. The 300mm f/4 AF-D NikkorAs far as telephoto lenses go, it really comes down to what you need that determines what you get. At one time, just about everyone wants a big telephoto lens of 400mm or greater, but unless you really need to haul that thing around for nature photography or sports, a tele zoom of 80-300mm is going to be the better choice. Fast telephotos are of course, very expensive and very heavy. Sports photographers and bird photographers will have those - and big apertures mean BIG pieces of glass, which also means $$$. However, if you just need a decent telephoto of 300mm for high school sports, etc., the 300mm f/4 AF Nikkor is still a great lens that sells from $250 -$400 used. Meanwhile, the manual focus 300mm f/4.5 Nikkor sells for about $150 or less. I have both of these lenses, and I rarely use the older manual lens, but the newer one has had a fair amount of use over the years, especially with an extension tube for insect close-ups.ZOOMING AROUNDThe Kiron 70-200mm f/4 zoom in OM mountZoom lenses have become a fixture and just about every new digital camera, whether fixed lens or a body with the ability to change lenses, comes with a zoom. In the days of auto-focus film SLRs, zoom lenses became the standard as film speed ratings of 400 ISO and higher allowed the proliferation of f/4.5-5.6 slow zooms with a typical range of 28-80mm kit lens. That trend continued into the DSLR era with the 18-55mm lenses for APS-C sensors. Back in the late 70s to late 80s, the typical zoom was a 70-210mm in any mount, but there are some surprises, such as the 1970s Vivitar Series 1 35-85mm f/2.8 zoom. That lens was available in all popular lens mounts, and while it is getting on in years, it still outperforms many modern short zooms.  It’s a short beast of a lens with a 72mm filter ring. Soligor’s compact 28-55mm f/3.3-4.5 variable aperture is a well-made short zoom that is excellent for wandering around with a camera. It has a close-up feature that lens you get to 1:3 reproduction. Yet, the lens isn’t any larger than a typical 55mm prime lens. In my opinion, one of the best manual zooms made is the Kiron 70-200mm f/4 macro zoom. It comes with a locking tab that keeps it at the desired focal length, and for a push-pull zoom, it’s still an excellent lens that’s available in popular lens mounts, and was also sold by Vivitar as a Series 1 lens. It’s a handful of lens, to be sure. There are many other Vivitar 70-210mm zooms, but only the Kiron-made model with the zoom-lock and 62mm filter size and a fixed f/4 maximum aperture is the one to get.  Another odd zoom is the Chinon 40-15mm f/3.5. It’s not a push-pull zoom, but a two ring zoom, with the lower ring rotating for the focal length. In addition, the macro ring allows it to close focus at any focal length, up to 1:4 close-ups. It has a nice bokeh, and a 67mm filter ring. It was available in popular lens mounts. It’s not a tiny lens, by any means, but certainly worth a look. Not the best - the 43-86mm Zoom-NikkorOne of the best - the 80-200 f/2.8 AF-D Zoom Nikkor43-75mm Fujinon ZoomThe Minolta 28-85 zoomA monster - the Tamron 35-210mm zoomThe Tamron 28-80 zoom is a good buy.Some of the really old zoom telephotos are massive, heavy metal beasts with so-so optics. I’d stay away from those 100-500mm f/8 zooms that look like a mortar on the front of your camera. However, you can often pick up some interesting old zooms for less than $20. With prime lenses, you can usually get a faster lens at a given focal length than zoom lenses, and if you want fast zooms, be prepared to spend money. Back in the previous century, a fast zoom would have been the Nikkor 80-200 f/2.8. Still, an amazing lens, but expensive and heavy. More likely, you would have the Nikkor 80-200 f/4 - which is a fantastic lens all around. Cheap manual zooms from the 1980s such as an Albinar 70-210 would typically be a variable zoom of f/4.5-5.6, or even f/6.3. In today’s market these old zooms sell for a few dollars, if at all. They are not necessarily bad, it’s just that there are much better lenses out there for not much money. When 200mm seemed ho-hum, lens manufacturers then went to 70-300mm zooms, and in the AF world, they are now commonplace. The Tamron 70-300mm is a lightweight and impressive AF zoom that has a 1:2 macro setting that really is quite good for a lot of nature photography.Nikon's best all-purpose AF zoomWithin the Nikon universe, I have a few favorite zooms that I use regularly:24-50mm f/3.3-4.5 AF Zoom Nikkor - great city street lens24-120mm f/3.5-5.6 AF Zoom Nikkor - excellent range of focal lengths - a \"one lens\" for travel80-200mm f/2.8 AF Zoom Nikkor - fantastic lens 70-210mm f/4-5.6 AF Zoom Nikkor - the old standby28-85mm f/3.5-4.5 Zoom Nikkor - pretty decent range, sharp35-105mm f/3.5-4.5 Zoom Nikkor - one that I have carried along the most75-150mm f/3.5 Series E Zoom Nikkor - one of my favorite lenses, by the way!The Nikon Series E 75-150mm f/3.5 - a favorite lensCare of your lensesSome advice for your lenses - don’t store them in the OEM lens cases, no matter the SLR system. Over time, these lens cases become fungal breeding grounds. Depending on their age and construction, deteriorating foam within a case can coat your lenses with a layer of black dust, so throw those old grungy lens cases away. Lenses should be stored where they won’t be subject to moisture, and never in a closed plastic container for any length of time. Yes, use silica gel to keep lenses free from moisture - only when necessary. Store them with the rear lens cap attached as well as the front one to avoid damaging the surfaces, and to keep them free from dust. Some people keep a skylight filter always attached to the front of a lens - not a bad idea when you are worried about damaging the front lens element when out shooting an expensive lens. However, I rarely have done that myself. I do use various filters when necessary, so the additional layer of glass from a UV filter really doesn’t warrant its use.   Clean the lens surfaces with a blower or lens brush and a microfiber cloth when out in the field. I always use lens tissue and an optic cleansing solution when I am cleaning lenses at home. There is a misconception that any flaw in a lens is something serious, and that it makes the lens nearly worthless. I can tell you that if you have ever looked at older lenses from before the 1960s, you will find some with a tiny bubble or two in the glass of some of the elements. That’s not a problem. A tiny scratch or \"wipe mark\" on the front element isn’t a problem, either. Interior dust in a lens usually is not a problem, either, and almost any telephoto zoom will have some. Some people obsess so much about perfection that those are treated as if they are big problems. They are not. Fungus and haze are problems, for sure. So is delamination of lens elements where the balsam cement has degraded. However, I once tested a 100mm Series E lens with a fair amount of fungus against the same lens model that was pristine. There was loss of contrast in the images made by the fungused lens - and somewhat softer image - but that didn’t make the lens unusable. If you have a nice lens that gets spots of fungus, or buy an expensive lens at a really low price because of the fungus, have it cleaned by a repair professional. While old lenses can often be disassembled and cleaned if you follow instructions and have all the right tools, modern lenses should go to a repair shop for cleaning and lubrication.   As the old Stone’s verse goes, \"You can’t always get what you want...\" but persistence and sometimes a bit of luck will get the lens you need. Sometimes it might take some time with a lens to really get used to the potential it offers. Other times, you’ll be gob-smacked immediately with it. The best thing is that the prices for older manual lenses makes it easier to acquire them and build a collection of lenses that become tools to work with. Just like a craftsman always has a box of different screwdrivers, that box of lenses will have something for almost every situation.  After all, no matter what SLR system you are using, it’s just a holder for a lens and film.  Have fun exploring with other lenses and see which ones become your favorites!"},
{"title": " TTArtisans 40mm f/2.8 Macro Lens ", "date": "Wednesday, October 26, 2022", "text": "Canon EOS M5 with TTArtisans 40mm Macro LensBack in early May, I purchased a used Canon EOS M5 from KEH, intending it to replace the long-serving Nikon 1 system that I had owned for nearly a decade.  The 24 MP APS-C sensor on the M5 was certainly an improvement, but so was the availability of lenses in the EOS-M mount.  My first lens for the M5 was the TTArtisans 35mm f/1.4, and while a fully manual lens with no electronic contacts, it worked well in A-mode, and the focus peaking feature on the M5 is a great help with manual focus lenses.  It was several months before I purchased the 15-45mm Canon AF zoom for the M5, and reaped the benefits of auto-focus and the nice zoom range with the image stabilized lens.  However, I still prefer to use prime lenses in much of the photography that I do with this nice mirrorless camera (which is probably being abandoned by Canon as it keeps pushing out the R-series mirrorless).  It suits my needs perfectly, and the one thing that I lacked was a lens for macrophotography.  I’m not into getting adapters to put big 35mm SLR lenses on a petite camera body, which negates the mirrorless camera’s advantages.  When I saw that a macro lens was available from TTArtisans, I knew that it was just the lens that I was looking for.  beautiful circular apertureAll metal constructionsturdy and substantial lens52mm front filter ringWith an APS-C sensor, the 40mm is roughly equivalent to 60mm in 35mm full-frame. Since the lens is capable of 1:1 reproduction without any accessories, that sealed the deal for me.  I ordered it from Adorama in NYC, and it was $99 before tax and free shipping. How a lens like this is only $100 baffles me, but if I didn’t like it I could always return it.  One reason these lenses are inexpensive is that they are fully manual with no electronic connections, motors, or \"modern\" conveniences.  The other reason, I presume, is that they are made in China. The third reason, is that they are available in a number of mirrorless camera system mounts.  The lens arrived from Adorama in a padded envelope, and is packaged very well in the box from TTArtisans.  The lens barrel is all metal, no plastic, giving it a heft that surprised me.  The focus ring turns smoothly and very precisely - there is no play in the focus, and the aperture click stops from f/2.8-16 feel perfect when handling.  The sort of precise feel that’s missing from modern lenses, in my opinion - because of electronic aperture control.  The lens, when fully extended, is 11.5 cm long, and when at infinity, it is 7 cm in length.  The filter ring is 52mm in diameter.  The working distance at 1:1 magnification is 4 cm.  The all-metal body weighs 388 grams. Compare that to the plastic-bodied 15-45 Canon zoom, which weighs 137 grams! I should note that the TTArtisans 35mm f/1.4 lens weighs 200 grams.  This is a well-constructed, precise lens that will definitely impress you with its build.  Of course, the other half of the equation is - the optics.  I’ve had the lens for about a week, and I’m totally impressed with it.  Fully extended lens at 1:1In terms of handling, it’s a great match for the M5 body. Focusing and aperture adjustment are easily performed, and the results from the lens so far are very pleasing.  The maximum aperture of f/2.8 is pretty much what one expects from a true macro lens, and while the minimum aperture is f/16, it matches well with the APS-C sensor size.  Beyond f/16, we would see diffraction starting to make images less sharp.  The aperture is perfectly circular, making for a pleasing bokeh when wide open.  from the TTArtisan site - 8 elements in 7 groupsAs a 40mm lens on the M5, it’s going to also be good for portraits, still-lifes, and of course, it excels as a macro lens.  For really close-up work, you’ll need lots of light if you wish some semblance of depth of field.  Raising the ISO will help in that regard, as I have yet to try external flashes with my M5, but LED light panels can do a pretty good job for many subjects. In my experience, nothing pumps as much light as a burst from a flash unit, so I’ll need to experiment to see what I can do in those situations.  field of view at 1:1zoomed and crop of the previous image - loads of detailOverall, I find no faults with this well-built, affordable lens.  TTArtisans sells it in all popular mirrorless mounts, including Fuji-X, M4/3, Nikon Z, and Sony.  For me, it’s easily carried around on the EOS M5, and is a lot of fun to take outdoors, where subjects abound and it only requires that you look. The TTArtisans 40mm macro lens will open new doors in your photography if you have never shot true macro before!I really like the results from the EOS M5I'm a long-time Nikon user, and you might wonder why I didn't switch to a Nikon Z-system mirrorless body.  Price, for one.  I paid less than $400 for the Canon EOS M5. Second, I just don't need a camera for video.  All the newer bodies seem to put video first and foremost in the features, and still photography is almost a second thought.  While the EOS M5 does do good video, it's definitely just part of the features.  In the end, it's a matter of the most bang for the buck, and the EOS M5 got my bucks."},
{"title": " Reflx Lab 400D Film Review", "date": "Saturday, October 08, 2022", "text": "A few months ago, I received a package from China with two rolls of film from Reflx Labs.  I’d seen their products on Instagram, and they offered to send me a couple of rolls  to try out. I hoped that I would have gotten this review done sooner, but now that I have developed the second roll, I think I can finally provide some observations on this film.The Reflx 400Daylight is actually Eastman Vision 250D with the remjet layer removed.  I commend Reflx Labs for providing this information on their website.  There is only one company making ECN-2 film at this time, and it’s Eastman Kodak. While the film is being pushed 2/3 of a stop, the Eastman Vision 3  film has enough latitude to handle the modest push.  I really like the screw-top aluminum canister that the film cassette is sold in.  That harkens back to the really good old days, and the aluminum canister reminds me of some 1960s Perutz film.  Inside the canister is the roll of film, a keychain ring, and a DX-code sticker to replace the one on the film cassette.  There is a small hole on the end of the spool to attach the keychain, which means you’ll need to ask the film lab to return the cassette if you wish to use it on the keychain.   There’s nothing second-rate about this cute little package, and I loaded up the first roll in my Nikon FE.   I shot that roll at the end of July, and had my local lab (Ball Photo) process the film as C-41.  The results were quite good, though at the time, I thought I was seeing some “light piping” going on.  There was a tiny bit at the beginning of the roll, but further camera testing revealed that I had a slight light-leak by the film door hinge. Argh!!The second roll was loaded into my Nikon F3HP which does NOT have any light leaks. I shot that roll during my trip to Lexington, VA, and finally developed it with the new Film Photography Project ECN-2 kit.  Even though the remjet has been removed, the ECN-2 chemistry and temperatures are just a bit different from C-41, and are the recommended developer.  It also allowed me to compare colors with the first roll.The only problems that I have seen with this film are the obvious light-piping early on in the roll, and after going through the images and editing, there are quite a few frames on the second roll that have black hair-like marks in the image.  Dust spots and hairs will show up as white in scans, but emulsion defects will be black.  It could be that these are caused by the remjet removal process, which is done prior to packaging.  They are easily cloned out in editing, but I'd rather not have to do that. This wasn't seen on the first roll, so maybe it's just a random occurrence.the arrow points to the black lines on the imageNot all were as bad as this - the arrows point to the black lineson the image.  The next image shows the edited version.The lowest point on the Blue Ridge Parkway - over the James River in VAI did not attempt to test the 400D in all types of situations, but shot it as I would any color film, and I think the images I got from the two rolls are very good in rendition - though there are a few times when there is some halation effect - an orange-ish halo around a \"hot spot.\"It should be no surprise that another seller has done what Cinestill has done. In the world of ECN-2 film stocks, Cinestill figured out a way to remove the remjet coating before packaging the film, so that the film could be processed as C-41.  In addition, Cinestill uprated the Vision 3 500T film to 800 ISO, about 2/3 of a stop.  I typically advise shooting the ECN-2 films at the box speed, but a 2/3 stop push isn’t a big deal.  The Reflx Lab 400D is similarly uprated, and the results show that the push isn’t a problem - at least in my experience. It looks good developed in C-41  as well as the native ECN-2.Images from Roll 1note the reddish halation from the bright spotsImages from Roll 2ghostly sprite from the light pipingConclusion - overall, I like this film - Vision 250D is an excellent daylight film - which I have always shot at box speed.  The Reflx Lab 400D may need some additional care by the company to avoid the light-piping along the frames and the abrasive marks that I see on roll 2.  As in any secondary sale of a film, there is always the chance that your results may vary if uses or treatment are different from the manufacturer's recommendations."},
{"title": "Moving from 50mm to 35mm as the “normal” lens", "date": "Saturday, October 01, 2022", "text": "Nikon FE 10 with Series E 35mm f/2.5 lensFor the good part of almost 50 years, I have considered a 50mm lens to be my “normal lens” for a lot of my photography, no matter what 35mm system I used.  For good reason, the 50mm lens was typically the “kit lens” and what was affordable at the time.  My first SLR was an Exakta Exa 2a with a 50mm f/2.8 Meyer-Optik Domiplan.  Cheap at the time (1974), and that's the ONLY lens I had for that camera for nearly a decade.  My second SLR was a Pentax ME in 1983, and I bought it with a Takumar 50mm f/2, and a 135mm f/2.8 lens at Service Merchandise in Ann Arbor, MI.  Again, that 50mm lens was my main lens until the year 2000, when I decided that I was going to get serious about photography. Since then,  the many SLR cameras and systems that I have owned have always had the 50mm prime lens as  my every-day lens.  You name it – Pentax K-mount and M-42 bodies, Minolta SLRs, Olympus, Miranda, Zenit, Nikon, Canon, Yashica, Fujica, Topcon – all had a 50mm lens as the primary lens.  Now, within that 50mm range, are lots of variations, and some amazing glass.  While I most often liked using a 50mm f/1.4 because of low-light shooting as well as shallow depth of field, some of the lenses such as the Minolta 58mm f/1.4 really is a fantastic lens.  However, I am a Nikon guy for the most part (aside from my Pentax Spotmatic love), and my typical lens has been anything from a 50mm f/2 (one of the sharpest lenses on the planet), to the pretty good 50mm f/1.8, to the every-day use 50mm f/1.4, and the 55mm f/1.2 Nikkor – which is a bit of a beast.   Now I have a LOT of different lenses, and use them according to the situation.  However, I'll bet that 70% of my images have been taken with a 50mm lens.  35mm f/3.5 Super Takumar, Kentmere 400 filmA 50mm lens typically has a field of view of 39°, whereas a 35mm lens has a field of view of 62° - certainly wider, but not as wide as 28mm, which has a field of view of 74°.  A 16mm fisheye lens has a 180° field of view, in case you are interested.  So, with that significantly wider view, the 35mm lens shines in being able to capture more in a scene, if that appeals to you.  For one thing, you don't have to back off as much to get things in the frame, making it a great choice for street photography.  I find that it's also great for natural scenes as well, and for landscapes, it gives a more normal view.35mm f/2 Super Takumar. Ultrafine Extreme 100 film35mm f/2 Super Takumar, Ilford HP-5Previously, the only camera that almost always was paired with a 35mm lens is my Leica M2 and the fantastic 35mm f/1.4 Summilux.  A great travel combo, and that should have told me something, right?  So, I am starting to change.  This summer, I used a 35mm f/3.5 on my Pentax Spotmatic, and really came to appreciate the slightly wider view on my Takumar Trek (see previous posts).  I started using my 35mm f/2 Nikkor on my Nikon bodies, and it's a fantastic lens.  Again, I used it on a recent trip to Lexington for a lot of my photography, and that slightly wider view became my “normal” view. For street photography and landscapes, as well as architecture, 35mm is a great choice.  It's hard to believe that it's taken me this many years to fully grasp how great a 35mm lens is for what I like to shoot.   Leica M2, 35mm f/1.4 Summilux, Fomapan 100.For a lot of things, the 50mm range is still very useful, and I'd never give them up.  But for travel, street photography, and the types of subjects that I enjoy, I'll be using 35mm lenses a lot more.    I am a prime lens enthusiast, but if you have a 35-70mm zoom, that'll work too.  In the Nikon world, there are several different 35mm lenses – if one looks at old and new, and in many cases, the lenses have not changed appreciably from non-AI (non Auto Indexing – see my post on Nikkormats for a full explanation) to the AIS versions, except for coatings.  In the auto-focus world, there are fewer choices, and I assume that there have been some changes made.  35mm f/2 Nikkor, Ilford HP-5NIKON 35s:Nikon F with the 35mm f/2.8 and the 35mm f/2 non-AI lenses    • 35 mm f/2.8 Nikkor  - introduced in 1959, this lens was a non-AI lens.  I have one that I keep on my plain prism Nikon F.  By later standards, it's not the greatest 35, but it's okay.    • 35mm f/3.5 PC Nikkor – This is a perspective control lens, as the front elements are able to shift along one plane to keep the camera parallel to the subject, so it's a special lens for architecture, and could also be used on a bellows for product photography.    • 35mm f/2 Nikkor – This faster 35mm lens is optically superior to the f/2.8, and was hugely popular with photojournalists. It's that wider view that aids when closer to the subject, and the more modern AIS version is what I am using.      • 35mm f/1.4 – Introduced as a non-AI lens, this was also popular with professionals, and is sharp corner to corner.  A highly regarded lens that remains popular in whatever version. Alas, I have never used one.All these non-AI versions above were upgraded to AI mounts in 1977. Then again, in 1982, to AIS.  Nikon FM3A with the 35mm f/2 AI lens    • 35mm f/2.5 Series E – actually, a nice lightweight and compact lens that works well with the compact bodies such as the FG, EM, and FE10.       • 35-70mm f/3.3-4.5 – if you want a short zoom – this is a good choice.  Very sharp at all focal lengths.    • 36-72mm f/3.5 Series E lens – a short, lightweight constant aperture zoom.  I consider it to be underrated.  Nikon AF lenses    • 35-70mm f/3.3-4.5 AF  and AF-D– A good choice for a carry-all short zoom.     • 35mm f/2 AF and AF-D - Excellent, like the manual version, but also focuses closer.      • 35-70mm f/2.8 AF and AF-D – a big lens with a 62mm front filter ring, this push-pull zoom is very sharp, and at the 35mm end, it is cable of 1:4 closeups.  Add a diopter on the front for even more magnification.  This is a great lens, though I consider it to be very beefy as short zooms go.    • 35-80mm f/4.5-5.6 AF-D – A kit lens that Nikon sold with The N50 ad N70 cameras, it's not fast nor great, but like any kit lens, it will do well enough for the users it was intended for.PENTAXMy favorite SP body with the diminutive 35mm f/3.5Spotmatic (M-42)    • 35mm f/3.5 Super-Takumar – compact, and while not fast, it's great!    • 35mm f/2 Super Takumar  – with a 67mm filter ring, this is not a tiny lens, but it is fast.  I highly recommend it if you can find one.The two 35s from Asahi Pentax in M-42 mountM-42 non-PentaxDue to the longevity and sheer numbers of cameras that used the M-42 mount, you'll find a variety of 35mm f/2.8 lenses available.  They may have the names Albinar, Chinon, Vivitar, Makinon, Soligor, as well as Carl Zeiss Jena Flektogon, Meyer Optik Primagon, etc.  There is a fast 35mm f/1.9 old Vivitar lens that is supposedly very good.  If the thrill is in the hunt, you'll have fun looking for 35mm screw-mount lenses.Soligor 35mm f/3.5 M-42 mount lensK-mountPentax released a number of lenses in K-M, K-A (to be able to operate in P mode), as well as AF and Digital versions.  I am only listing the manual lenses.    • 35mm f/2    • 35mm f/2.8    • M-35mm f/1.4 (58mm filter ring)    • M-35mm f/2.8, M-35mm f/2 – both have 49mm filter rings    • M-zoom 35-70 f/2.8-3.5    • A-zoom 35-70mm f/4    • A-zoom 35-70mm f/3.5-4.5non-Pentax K-mount    • Tokina SL 35mm f/2.8    • Chinon  35-70mm f/3.5-4.5 MC Macro zoom    • Rikenon P Zoom 35-70mm f/3.5-4.5 Macro (maybe the same lens as the Chinon?)MINOLTA    • 35mm f/1.8 MD     • 35mm f/2.8 MD – I have used one of these, but it's been a while.  Like many MD lenses, it was also made earlier with an MC desgnation.    • 35mm f/1.4 and 35mm f/2 Maxxum (now Sony Alpha) CANON    • FL-mount (can be used with FD cameras, too)    • FL 35mm f/2.5 – 58mm filter    • FL-35mm f/3.5 – 48mm filter    • FL-35mm f/2.8 “pancake” lens, 48mm filterFD-mount    • FD- 35mm f/2 S.S.C.  55mm filter    • FD- 35mm f/3.5 S.S.C. 55Mm filter    • FD- 35mm f/28 TILT-SHIFT  S.S.C.  - tilts and shifts – fantastic choice for architecture.      • FD -35mm f/2.8 S.S.C. 52mm filter    • FD- 35-70mm f/3.5 zoom – with its “macro” setting, it can provide some very good close-ups.EOS-mount     • EF- 35mm f/2    • EF -35mm f/1.4 USM L – expensive!OLYMPUS    • OM Zuiko 35mm f/2    • OM Zuiko 35mm f/2.8    • OM Zuiko Shift 35mm f/2.8  - a perspective control lensWhile I haven't listed every single 35mm lens out there, this list is at least be a starting point.  There are lots of 35-70mm zoom lenses that I have not listed, and that may be a good choice for you, but remember, those zooms won't usually have as large an aperture as a prime lens. Last, but not least, Leica R4 with a 35-70mm f/3.5 Vario-ElmarNo matter what 35mm SLR system you use, or rangefinders with the M-39 Leica thread mount  or Leica M mount, there exists a 35mm lens to get you a bit wider view."},
{"title": "Looking Back -  The Land of Enchantment - 2003", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2022", "text": "Abiqui near Ghost Ranch, Argus C3, Ilford Pan-F filmSame scene, Nikon FA, 28mm, Fuji AstiaA few weeks ago, I contracted COVID from a visiting friend. It's as if a couple of weeks went missing, in terms of doing anything.  I was really miserable for several days, and even though I was testing negative after a little over a week, my body was still recovering.  It was during that time that I decided that I needed to do something productive, even if I wasn't up to going out and about.  I'd been going through some of my file boxes of older prints and negatives from 2000-2002, winnowing out the crappy stuff and just keeping what I felt was worthwhile. During that process, I realized that hardly anything from my 2003 trip to New Mexico had ever been printed, and none it had been scanned - other than a random photo or two.  I have three 3-ring binders of images from that trip - two are just 35mm slides, and one was only negatives, mostly black and white.  Nineteen years is quite a long stretch of time, and I figured it was a good time to scan in those long-neglected images and re-discover what I photographed on that trip. The other aspect worth mentioning is that as I have presented before - viewing images far removed from the immediacy of an event means that there is less emotional attachment to them, and one can view more objectively as to their merit.  In other words, the images stand on their own if they are good.  White Sands National Monument. Nikon FM2N, Aga APX 25, red filterThe trip was a family vacation with my wife Adrienne, and our daughter Marjorie, who had also gotten the photography bug from me, and between the two of us, there were perhaps over a dozen cameras.  Somewhere, I have a photo of a table with all the Nikon gear that I had planned to bring, but without seeing it I know that I packed: Nikon FA (used mostly for E-6), Nikon FM2N (black and white), Nikon N60 (C-41), Rollei 35TE, Contax G1, Holga, Kiev 60, Pentax 6x7, Argus C-3, Argus C-4, and a single-use camera.  Of course, there were lenses, filters, tripod, etc.  I know that Marjorie brought her Kiev 80 (Hasselblad 1000 clone), and at least one Nikon SLR and an Argus or two. In hindsight, I should have only brought one medium format camera - and it appears that I used the Kiev 60 quite a bit. We left Michigan on July 9 and returned around July 19.  For some stupid reason, I stopped entering anything into a daily journal of the trip on July 12. So, anything that happened after that-- exact locations, etc., are now just extrapolations from the photographs. Lesson learned - always keep a journal when traveling!  I am very good about that now, but obviously, wasn't then.   Just as a way to try and piece things together, I typed up the notes that I made in 2003, and realized how much is lost when things are not written down.  Nearly 20 years later, there are things that I remember from that trip - all of which are triggered by seeing the images.  Memories are faulty, which is why journals are important.near Carlsbad, New Mexico, Kiev 60, Ilford SFX 200Kiev 60, Ilford Delta 100As I started scanning in the black and white negatives on my Epson V700, I started to appreciate that I actually did do some pretty good photography on that trip. I'd always considered the two binders of slides to be representative of what I saw, and where we visited, but after seeing the monochrome images, I find that those images are far more impactful in terms of mood, landscape complexity, and more meaningful. I'll post some examples here, of course, to illustrate some points.  One of the reasons that I may not have printed many of these images - other than proof sheets of the negatives - was possibly because of the frame spacing issues with the Kiev 60, and also because at that time, my darkroom skills were still fairly limited.  After all, I had only acquired the darkroom in Dec. 2002, as it was included in the house that we purchased.  So, as time went on, the 2003 negatives were hidden away as I did new work. Anyhow, one of the great things about scanning in those negatives is that post-scan editing allowed me to fix problematic frames that I never would have been happy with in the darkroom.  The Kiev 60 frame-spacing issues were never the same from roll to roll. Some rolls were just fine, others had frames nearly overlapping, or at best with about 1 mm of space between them.  I eventually sold the Kiev 60 - and while the exposures I made with it were very good, I didn't like the unpredictability of the frame spacing.  As 6x6 SLRs go, the Praktisix, Pentacon Six, and the Kiev 60 are all quite similar with the same problems. That's really too bad, because the images from them are quite good.Bisti Badlands, Kiev 60, Kodak Tri-XBisti Badlands, Kiev 60, Kodak Tri-XWe put a lot of miles on our 1999 Plymouth Voyager van on that trip, and we traveled quite a bit each day - made possible by the fact that we mostly took interstates and major highways to reach our destinations.  However, when we took secondary roads, that's where the fun was. Some of my favorite photos are of lesser-known sights.  New Mexico is a fascinating state to explore - the people, the places, and the history, as well as the varied topography and geology present innumerable photographic opportunities, and on that trip, we barely scratched the surface. We entered New Mexico at Clovis, and stayed the first night at the Frontier Motel near Roswell.  After that, the only motel I know that we stayed at was the Travel Lodge motel in Santa Fe.  Not keeping a journal was an error I hope never to repeat.The Frontier Motel in 2003. Nikon N60, Kodak Gold 200.Our visit to Carlsbad Caverns was made even more dramatic by the temperature differential - it was 105°F outside, but mid-50s and high humidity inside the caverns. I actually shot one roll of film inside the caverns - in well-lit examples of the formations. For that I used the Nikon N60 and Agfa Vista 800 color film. I am amazed at how well they came out.  We stayed late to watch the free-tail bats emerge from the mouth of the cavern, and it was quite the experience - thousands and thousands of bats -looking somewhat like a cloud of butterflies.Inside Carlsbad Caverns - Nikon N60, Agfa Vista 800 film.We visited Sitting Bull Falls in the Guadeloupe Mountains, and were not disappointed.  The falls was an oasis amidst the Chihuahuan Desert landscape.  While not a roaring waterfall like one might see in the East, the falls cool spray of water created a microclimate of lush vegetation and I'm sure a lot of local wildlife was attracted to the oasis.  At the time, I was really entranced by the Libellula saturata dragonflies that were abundant there. Sitting Bull Falls, Nikon FA, Fuji SensiaLibellula saturata, Nikon FA, Fuji Sensia We stopped in the town of Artesia - an area defined by its heavy agricultural use, as well as oil and gas wells. Downtown Artesia features a beautiful city park with fountains, all with historical scenes in ceramics and murals that depict Artesia's history.  Part of the Heritage Walkway, Artesia. Nikon FA, Fuji SensiaWe drove westward on US 82, went through the amazing mountain village of Cloudcroft, and then after leaving the tunnel through the mountain - came into a completely different desert basin with Alamogordo in the distance. From Alamogordo, we drove N on US-54, and spent some time at Three Rivers Petroglyphs BLM site - incredibly fascinating with its many ancient petroglyphs on the basalt rocks.  The age of these glyphs are thought to be at least 1,000 years old.  Beetle Yard, Alamogordo, Nikon FA, Kodachrome 64Bighorn sheep with 3 arrows, Petroglyph. Nikon FM2N,Ilford Delta 100 film.From there, we briefly explored the Valley of Fire near Carrizozo - called the Valley of Fire due to the lava flows that were deposited there at a time when indigenous people would have probably seen it happen - about 7000-10000 years ago.  The black flows look quite similar to what one would find on Hawaii. Of course, beyond the black rocks of the Valley of Fire is the Tularosa Valley with the White Sands Missile Range, and White Sands National Monument - which we spent a morning exploring.  I shot a lot of images there with the Kiev 60, and came away with a few really good shots.   It's definitely a place where one should get there either early in the morning or late in the day to take advantage of the lower sun angle over the gypsum dunes.White Sands NM, Nikon FA, Chromex filmPetroglyphs, Nikon FA, Kodachrome 64Valley of Fire, Nikon FA, Kodachrome 64Valley of Fire, Nikon FA, Kodachrome 64We spent several nights in Santa Fe, making day trips around the area.  Santa Fe remains one of my favorite places due to the adobe architecture, the arts, and the general laid-back atmosphere there.  One of the reasons for going to Santa Fe was a photography-themed month that featured work by many notable photographers.  The Stieglitz exhibit at the Georgia O'keeffe Museum was wonderful, and while I know we visited other galleries there, I don't recall a single one now - and of course, I didn't write it down!  During our stay, we visited Bandelier National Monument, Taos, Ranchos De Taos, Rio Grande Gorge, Abiquiu, and the Ghost Ranch perimeter.  Santa Fe, Contax G1, Fuji SensiaSan Miguel Mission, Contax G1, Fuji SensiaSanta Fe, Contax G1, Fuji SensiaSanta Fe, Contax G1, Fuji SensiaSanta Fe, Contax G1, Fuji SensiaA harmonious McD's in Taos, NM.

They really looked other-worldly, and would make a great spot for a science-fiction setting.  We didn't see another soul while walking/driving around there, which gave it an even more desolate feeling.  We then drove to the Four Corners monument - which is where CO, UT, AZ and NM meet.  I had been there once before in 1980, and in the 20+ years since, the visitor center and other amenities had sprung up.  The area is within the Navajo Reservation and I think the tribe runs the visitor center.  Since Marjorie had her Kiev 80 with her, people asked her to take their photographs with their cameras - this is well before the iPhone changed how many people took photographs. I, on the other hand, just had a Nikon around my neck, so I guess I didn't look professional enough!   Bisti Badlands, Nikon FA, Fuji SensiaBisti Badlands, Nikon FA, Fuji SensiaFrom the four corners, I think we went past Shiprock, to Farmington, and then into Colorado, where we drove on the \"Million Dollar\" highway from Durango to Silverton.  We eventually went through Monarch Pass, where we took the cable car to the top.  From there, it was a quick trip through Rocky Mountain National Park.  What impressed me most was the afternoon thunder storms - and I did get some good lightning shots with my Rollei 35, until I could hear the car antenna buzzing, at which point I quickly loaded my gear into the van and hoped that we wouldn't get a strike.  Rollei 35 TE, Kodachrome 64.We made our way up to Nebraska, to visit Carhenge in Alliance, and drove through the Sand Hills region and after that, it was a dash home on interstate 80.  People talk about \"flyover country\" and we certainly drove through it.  All the places we went had their own kind of beauty, and whether it was the rolling sand hills of Nebraska, the prairies, the Rockies, the Chihuahuan Desert, or the gypsum flats of New Mexico, there is something to be seen and appreciated. Simply flying in to a city and making day trips to the highlight places does not give you a sense of scale or the same sense of place.  To drive there is to have a much richer experience.  The journey is the reward, said Steve Jobs. He was right.Carhenge, Alliance, NE. Kiev 60, Ilford HP-5Carhenge, Nikon FA, Fuji AstiaCarhenge, Nikon FA, Fuji AstiaI just finished digitizing the slides that I shot on that trip, and used my Nikon Df with a Nikon PB-4 bellows and slide copying adapter. The lens, the old 45mm GN F-mount did a great job with the slides.  I'd say that for every sheet of 20 slides, the average number selected to be scanned was 4 per page.

{"title": " Contax IIa - a gem from Zeiss Ikon", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2022", "text": "Contax IIa (1950-1961)At one time, if you wanted to shoot with the best 35mm rangefinder cameras, there were two choices - the Barnack Leicas from Leitz, or the Contax cameras from Zeiss Ikon. (A third choice would be a Kodak Retina, which I have already discussed here on RCB.)  While both choices were the top of the line, each manufacturer approached the design for a 35mm rangefinder quite differently.  I have shot with several different Leica models, and found that the eyepiece for a Leica IIIc is barely more usable to a glasses-wearer than an Argus C3 viewfinder. The Contax, however, has a larger viewfinder with a wider baseline for the rangefinder, making rangefinder focus more accurate, and without having to look through a separate window.  The design for the Contax II was so good, that it was essentially copied by Nippon Kokagu as the basis for the Nikon S series rangefinder cameras. The Contax has a unique shutter design - and the Kiev copies made in Ukraine from 1947-87 share the same type of shutter, which is vertically traveling.  Comprised of thin aluminum slats bound with nylon ribbon, the shutter looks like a set of closed venetian blinds. The Nikon S series use a horizontal-traveling rubberized silk shutter, with the later SP using a Titanium foil horizontal shutter, just like the Nikon F.  So, while a Nikon S series may have a similar appearance to the Contax IIa, only the rangefinder, removable back, and lens mount are really the same.  The Kiev copies of the Contax are remarkably similar, but not manufactured with the same quality as the Contax models.  The best writeup on the Contax IIa is on the Casual Photophile site, and I concur with that author on the quality of the IIa and how it's really one of the best classic 35mm rangefinder cameras ever made.  Kiev 4a - a copy of Contax IIaNikon S frontNikon S top deckThese cameras are getting on in years, and if you acquire a real Contax model, it may be worth getting it serviced to make sure you get the best from these cameras. While a Contax IIa certainly is a great camera to use, the prices tend to be much lower than a Leica from the same time period.  Nikon S series rangefinder cameras improved on the Zeiss Ikon design, and give the same experience as the Contax IIa. However, prices for a Nikon S, S2, SP, and S3 are really high these days, but certainly worth looking into.  That leaves the Kiev copies in the very affordable range, and the only Kiev Contax copy I ever owned was a Kiev 4a, and the brass used for the film advance spindle broke shortly after I acquired it.  I decided that was enough of an experience with the Soviet copies.I once tried out a Nikon S that I was selling for an estate, and the user experience was even better than the Contax IIa.  Zeiss Ikon made the decision to drop their Contax rangefinder line and instead concentrate on making SLRs, and I have to say that was a big mistake. Nippon Kokagu improved their versions of the Nikon S series, and the Nikon SP became a professional's choice.  Those cameras paved the way for the Nikon F SLR, which is based on a Nikon SP with a prism and mirror box, all other characteristics being the same.  Meanwhile, the Zeiss Ikon Contaflex, a lens-shutter SLR, was no match for the better engineered Nikon F with a proven focal-plane shutter and excellent array of lenses.  In a nutshell, one could argue that the Contax IIa was the zenith of Zeiss Ikon. Used by photo-journalists, the Contax gave up ground to its successor, the Nikon SP, and once they had those in their hands, it was an easy transition to the Nikon F, sealing the fate of Zeiss Ikon as a lumbering producer of cameras that while broad, was very shallow, with only a few really successful models.  The nimble and innovative camera industry of Japan gave us the Spotmatics, Nikon Fs, Topcons, Minolta SRs, Canon Ps, and others, which pretty much buried most of the European and American competitors in the consumer marketplace.  Leica, Hasselblad and Rollei stand out because they catered to professionals and are quality tools.  However, the various German companies that were NOT Leitz, or Rollei eventually succumbed to market forces, and by the 1970s, had largely died out. The Contax name was purchased by Yashica (and eventually Kyocera), and while the name went on, Zeiss Ikon was no longer a camera manufacturer.  The Argus C-3 is the poor man's Contax 1.  There are many superficial similarities, no doubt because Vershoor saw the Contax 1 at acamera show in the early 1930s. However, it's a blunt instrument comparedto the Contax I. The Argus C3 sold well in the USA, at a price the average American could afford. Today, you can buy a Contax IIa or IIIa for a modest price, and certainly pay far less than one might purchase a Leica M2, which I would consider to be the approximate equal to a Contax IIa.  Neither camera has a meter, and both are fully mechanical. While the Contax has a better film-loading system, the Leica M2 has different frame lines for 35, 50, and 90mm lenses.  I would recommend that if you are in the market for a classic Contax, purchase a post-WWII Contax IIa with the 50mm f/2 Zeiss-Opton Sonnar lens. With one of the new external light meters in the accessory shoe, you'll have a camera that is a pleasure to use with extremely good optics.In using a Contax IIa, you'll note that there is no advance lever, but a knob wind.  Film speeds are all adjusted beneath the film wind knob, and they range from T & B to 1-1/1250 sec. That was the fastest shutter speed for any 35mm camera for quite some time. Adjusting the focus with the front focus wheel via your index finger makes it quite easy to focus and make an exposure with the shutter release in the center of the film advance knob.  It's obvious that Charles Vershoor of the International Research Corp. saw the Contax I in the early 1930s, and the resulting Argus C3 has a similar control, it's nowhere as refined or smooth as the Contax! In fact the squared-off appearance of the Contax I must have inspired the brick-like Argus C.There is a lot of information about the Contax rangefinder cameras available online, but the best overview of these cameras is found in the book \"Collecting and Using Classic Cameras\" by Ivor Matanle.(1986, Thames & Hudson, 224 pp., ISBN #0-500-27656-0).  Matanle's book is profusely illustrated with more than 300 photos, and his insights on the various cameras are really helpful.  It's certainly a book that anyone collecting/using classic cameras should own.  While there are many versions of the pre-war Contax rangefinders, starting with the Contax I, The post-war Contax IIa is going to be the one that is likely to work as it should.  The Contax IIIa differs in having an uncoupled Selenium light meter, which is most likely not going to work, and modern light meters are so much better.It's one thing to own a Contax rangefinder, and acquiring accessories for it is another exercise and rabbit hole.  The filter thread diameter of the 50mm f/2 Sonnar is 40.5mm, and I have a Zeiss red filter that was made for my camera.  If you decide that you would like to use other focal lengths, you would also need to find the viewfinders that match the focal lengths. However, sometimes the fun is in the hunt! Of course, of you wanted to use other filters, you could look for a 40.5mm to 46mm thread adapter.Contax IIa with red filter. Results below.I found the Contax IIa a pleasure to use - easy to focus and while a lever film advance would be nice - it's not a big deal.  For that bit of improvement, a Nikon SP is what you would be looking for, at a lot more $$!  Some images:  All taken with Ultrafine Extreme 400 film, May, 2022.red filterred filterred filterRight now, I have a roll of Kodak Color Plus 100 in the Contax, and am looking forward to the results."},
{"title": " The Takumar Trek Part 2", "date": "Monday, July 11, 2022", "text": "Homerville, OH Post Office, Svema FN-64It's been a couple of weeks since I returned home, and I am finally caught up with developing and scanning of the film from my trip. I am pretty happy with the 18 rolls that I shot, and as I have been scanning them, it's given me time to evaluate where I shot and my results from the different films and lenses.  One of the constraints imposed on myself was of course, the use of fully manual cameras, and not my typical Nikons.  The three Spotmatics - two SP - one silver, one black, and the Spotmatic F, each worked well, and at any time where I felt that the metering wasn't quite right, I reverted to my own intuition/sunny-16 to override the camera's indication.  In all, almost all of my exposures were where they should have been, and the Takumar lenses performed beautifully.  Standish, MIMy favorite combo was the black Spotmatic SP with the 35mm f/3.5 Takumar lens.  I rarely used a different lens with that body, and it's made a believer of me that 35mm is a great all-purpose travel focal length.  This trip was also the first time that I used a Spotmatic exclusively on a road trip since 1980.  My photographic skill set is much improved since then, as is my appreciation for the place that photography has in documenting the ephemeral.  In 1980, I was a 23-year old graduate student using a borrowed Spotmatic for my thesis work, and on a field trip to the SW US.  Now, I'm a 65 year old retiree that's looking backwards on these road trips, knowing what's been lost as I travel forward. The Spotmatics that I used are basic photographic tools - had I made such a trip in 1974, the Spotmatic F would have been the latest model, and the last, as Pentax moved to the K-mount series of SLRs.  Now, the Spotmatic F is considered to be an old classic, not on par with a Nikon FE, but more like a Nikon FM.  However, as I found on this trip, once you immerse yourself with a specific set of gear, you get comfortable with its operation and abilities, and it becomes effortless to use.  To me, that's the hallmark of good ergonomics and design.  The Spotmatics are not quirky to use, they work smoothly, and don't get in the way of making a photograph.  Also, it was a revelation to me at just how good that 35mm f/3.5 Takumar lens is at street/documentary images.  For the longest time, I have thought that the 50mm was \"it.\" I still like 50mm for a lot of things, but as I found with my Leica M2 and the 35mm f/1.4 Summilux, that slightly wider view is better suited for travel and roadside adventures.Standish, MIclose-up of the gull slide, Tawas, MII didn't shoot too many different film stocks on this trip - Eastman 5231 (thanks, Bill P!), Kentmere 100, Kentmere 400, Ilford HP-5+, oh, and my last roll of Svema FN-64 that I had already loaded in my new-to-me black Spotmatic SP that I had purchased at Ball Photo not long before the trip.   It was C-41 only in the Spotmatic F, and the roll of Lomography Color 100 was a nice surprise in how it rendered colors.  Also, a probably expired roll of Rite-Aid 400 (shot at 200) was lovely - maybe it was Agfa?  My results from Fuji 200 and Kodak Gold 200 were as expected.  I think my favorite emulsion on this trip was Ilford HP-5, which I used a lot for the candids at Photostock, and they came out beautifully.  I know there are a lot of photographers that swear by Kodak Tri-X, and I have certainly shot it a great deal in the past -- but I love Ilford's HP-5+ and Kentmere 400 so much more. That's the beauty of film, though - you can find an emulsion that suits your style, regardless of the type of camera or system that you use.  Whether it's a 1950s Leica or a 2000s Canon EOS or Nikon FM3a, you can get the kind of image you want just by changing the film. These simple cameras like the Spotmatics do one thing really well - an uncomplicated view, a reasonable set of shutter speeds, and a variety of excellent lenses, to let a photographer really \"see\" and produce an image that is made as much in the mind as it is on the piece of film.   I never once worried about my battery life while traveling with the Spotmatics.  To me, that IS freedom.Part of US-23 in Michigan - the best part!As I have been transferring what I wrote in my journal onto typed pages, I gathered together the maps that I used to trace my route, and it's far more illuminating than trying to see it on a computer screen.  I  love using Google Earth to see where I was, and also to check things out ahead of a trip, but you can't possibly see a trip like this in its entirety at a comprehendible level on a single screen.  Laying out the road maps, seeing the relationship of the route with other features and in context with a greater area, gives more understanding to the 2,241 miles that I traveled in 8 days.  This intersection of digital and analog involves not just photography, but also cartography and writing.  As I have often stated, a paper map doesn't tell you where you are, it shows you where you can go.  On that small screen of the Garmin GPS attached to my windshield, I can see where I am, but it's not showing me the possibilities that a paper map gives me. Not far from where 23 ends at I-75 in Mackinaw CityOscoda, MIPort of Cheboygan, MICross Village, MIUS-31, N of Petoskey, MIThat is part of the fun of doing these trips - encountering the unknown and the unexpected.  Part of my reason for taking US-23 was just that -- the unknown.  It took me through the coal regions of KY, WV, VA, and the Ohio river valley, the flat expanses of agriculture in Ohio, and up into the beauty of the lakeshore in Michigan.  If you truly want to see America, you need to drive it. US-23 is one of the original 1929 US routes, and whether you pick the Lincoln Highway, Route 1, Route 2, Route 11, the remnants of Route 66, or some other secondary road (not the Interstates), you'll see more of every day America and can make your own conclusions.   My next goal is to take US-23 all the way to Jacksonville, FL and document that trip.  Maybe it will be with Spotmatics  for Takumar Trek II!I shot a lot - and some images are reserved for ongoing projects, some for an upcoming zine or book, and I'll show a few more here.  Check my Flickr account (mfophotos) for more.  Paradise, US-23 and Lime City Rd, OhioPetoskey State Park, MILouisa, KYPound, VA, US-23The Pikeville, KY  \"Pyramid\" on US-23Worthington, OH DQ, US-23Clare, MI rest areaSome Photostock 2022 friends"},
{"title": "The Takumar Trek", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2022", "text": "I have returned from my latest road trip, that accounted for 2,241 miles over 9 days - which had several objectives. Primarily, it was a trip to Photostock 2022 in Cross Village, MI, but it also included a US 23 journey, a visit with my sister and her husband in Canton, Ohio, and photographing small post offices along the way, and almost all of it was photographed using several Pentax Spotmatics and a Pentax 6X7.  My new to me Canon EOS M5 camera also got used a bit, as well as the Horizon 202 and Ansco Pix Panorama.  However, it was the lovely black Pentax Spotmatic SP shown here that was used the most.  I picked it up at Ball Photo in Asheville a few weeks before my trip, which started on June 20 and ended June 28.    The lens that I used the most is the Super Takumar 35mm f/3.5, as its coverage is perfect for travel photography, and it's also a relatively small lens, especially compared with my 35mm f/2 monster!   The Spotmatic SPs and Spotmatic F (which was almost always paired with the 28mm f/3.5) accounted for about 15 rolls of film during this trip, mostly in black and white.  The Spotmatic F always had a roll of color C-41 film.  Film waiting to be developed!My route US-23 is a long-term project, and all that remains is to do the route S of Weaverville. There's a lot that I have photographed along it in previous years in Michigan, but it was never really a \"project\" at the time.  The northern terminus of US-23 is at Mackinaw City, MI where it ends at I-75.  I only did part of US-23 going N, because I had to cut over to Canton, OH to visit my sister.  That gave me the opportunity to check ahead of time for routes that would take through small towns with post offices. Hartville, OHIn Ohio, it was route 224 that took me from Canton OH area to I-75 N to MI and US-23.   On the return trip it was US-23S all the way from Ann Arbor, MI to Weaverville, NC.  Going N on US-23 in Michigan, I started in Standish, where US-23N splits off from I-75. The rest of that route follows the coastline up to Mackinaw City.The northern terminus of US-23N at I-75 in Mackinaw City, MIPhotostock was held in Cross Village, MI this year, and Bill Schwab, the organizer, did a wonderful job putting together a meeting and event that brought photographers together for a couple of days. It was fun sharing our work, seeing old friends and making new ones in a very laid-back atmosphere along the Lake Michigan coastline. It was a long trip for me, and I'm glad that I went, as it became part of the Takumar Trek. I have yet to process my film from this trip, but I will get started on it shortly.  I'll be sharing some of the images here, on Instagram, and of course, on my Flickr account (all mfophotos).Waiting for the train to do its crossing at Standish. Paul Bunyan and Babe, in Ossineke, MII had some time to kill before Photostock, so I stayed two nights in Mackinaw City, and on June 23, I took a short trip into the Upper Peninsula to revisit some spots along US-2.  Gould City, MINaubinway, MII returned to the lower Peninsula in the early afternoon, and drove down to Petoskey, in time to attend a lecture and exhibit by Henry Horenstein at the Crooked Tree Arts Center.  If you have heard Horenstein's name - it's probably because he has authored the best manuals for b&w photography.  His exhibit  - Honky Tonk, is a wonderful look at people, musicians, and bars from the 1970s.  I highly recommend it if you are going to be anywhere near Petoskey, MI.The next couple of days were all at Photostock, and while I mostly shot film there, here are a few images from Cross Village.It's pretty tough to beat a Lake Michigan sunsetAfter Photostock, it was back on the road - southward, and eventually on US-23 from Ann Arbor all the way home.  That's for another post!"},
{"title": "Some Fun with the Topcon Uni SLR", "date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2022", "text": "A little over a month ago, a Topcon Uni landed in my hands,  and I thought that I should at least give it a try.  About a decade ago, I owned one that had some exposure problems, and mentioned it in my previous RCB post about leaf-shutter SLRs.  Generally, I am not a fan of leaf-shutter SLRs because just about every single one that I have tried has not aged well, due to the shutters not holding up over the last 50+ years.  Don't even get me started about the Zeiss Ikon Contaflex series of leaf-shutter SLRs.  So many bad vibes with those!  Topcon, the brand from Tokyo Kokagu, was generally considered to be a very good SLR, and despite the likes of Asahi Kokagu and Nippon Kokagu, the Topcon RE Super was the first TTL SLR in 1963, beating both Nikon and Pentax to that achievement.  The Topcon line of SLRS had excellent lenses, and to this day, a Topcon Super D is still a nice camera to use, and finding one cheaply on eBay is pretty difficult.  However, one knock against Topcon was the use of an Exakta lens mount that due to its small throat diameter, prevented faster lenses such as those made by Pentax, Nikon, Canon, and Minolta.  As the company reached the mid-70s, it could not compete with the other major camera companies, and stopped sales of 35mm cameras in 1980.  Cameras such as the Topcon Uni, Unirex and Unirex EE did not use the Exakta lens mount, but what has been termed the Topcon UV lens Mount.  These lenses for this mount do not contain an aperture control, which is instead dialed in on the body of the camera.  The cameras are lens-shutter cameras, with a Seikosha shutter behind the lens.While the Topcon Uni is certainly not a top-of-the-line SLR, it was certainly good enough to suit the intended audience of the casual photographer back in the mid-late 1960s looking for an SLR with some automation (shutter priority) and ease of use.  Features:Seikosha Shutter with B, 1- 1/500 sec speedsShutter Priority and Manual exposurePC flash socket, cold shoe on top of cameraself-timerASA (ISO) settings from 25-4001.35V PX-625 Mercury cell for meterfront-mounted shutter releasetripod socketIn use, the Topcon Uni may feel like a different experience from your normal focal-plane shutter SLR.  In a focal-plane shutter, the mirror flips up and the shutter curtain does its thing, and the mirror returns for the next exposure.  All the while, the aperture typically opens to the desired value as the press the shutter and the shutter curtain is opened.  With the Topcon Uni, it's a bit different. The aperture and shutter are wide open when the camera is not making an exposure, but the mirror prevents any light from reaching the film.  As you press the shutter button, the shutter closes, and as the mirror flips up, the aperture opens/closes to the desired value, the shutter opens and closes, and then the mirror flips back down, whereupon the shutter and aperture return to the open position.  A lot happens, making this complex dance between the shutter, aperture, and mirror prone to  problems down the road.  On top of that, the CdS TTL meter sets the aperture from the chosen shutter speed.  It's also just a bit noisy and not as smooth-sounding as a typical SLR, such as a Spotmatic.  I took the Topcon Uni on a short drive and photographed with it in Burnsville, NC. It's the seat for Yancey Co., and at 2825 ft, is located in a valley surrounded by the Black Mountains to the E and the Blue Ridge to the S and W. The highest peak East of the Rockies is Mt. Mitchell, just a few miles away from Burnsville.  It's a nice town with cafes, restaurants, some wilderness outfitters, and a local brewery.  There is a closed theater, the Yancey, which deserves to be open once again, but I don't know if it will ever reopen.  The town is named for Otway Burns, a naval hero in the war of 1812, and a statue honoring him is at the town square.  The oldest building in town, the Nu-Wray Inn dates to the 1830s, The Inn is being refurbished and should open in the near future.  There are a number of shops in the center of town that are worth a visit if you are there.The Yancey theater.  Image from Canon EOS M5I loaded a roll of Eastman 5231 (a cinema version of Plus-X), which has become one of my favorite films.  Although I placed a PX-625A cell in the camera, I didn't trust the metering, and mostly shot in manual mode, using my intuition (informed sunny-16).  The 53mm f/2 UV Topcor lens prformed well, and overall, I was pretty happy with the photos that I took.  Development was in D-96 for 7 minutes.  Using the camera is pretty simple, and after I shot the roll of film, I realized that if I'd set the ASA to 1 stop lower than the actual film speed, the additional voltage in the P-625A would then give me a fairly accurate reading for the actual film speed.  I should have realized this upfront.  There's a lot of information on Topcon cameras, and the Camera-wiki is a fantastic resource if you need to find more information in one place.  There's a wonderful post about Topcon on 678 Vintage Cameras. Getting a manual from the Butkus site is recommended, and so is making a donation for the manual.  It's a lot of work to maintain the site and scan the manuals.  And they are free.Some results from my day in and around Burnsville, NC.I shoot a info page on my computer screen.Yancey Co.

{"title": "The 35mm Folding Camera", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2022", "text": "Kodak Retina I, type 126, with vintage Kodak 35mm film cassetteIn the early days of 35mm cameras, the Barnack Leica was considered to be the epitome of a  quality compact 35mm camera. However, what are often overlooked are the Retina series of cameras, made by Kodak's German factory, Nagel Werke in Stuttgart, which became Kodak A.G.  Retina cameras were manufactured there from 1934 - 1969, and included the renowned Instamatic 500.  Kodak acquired Nagel-Werke in 1932, and the Vollenda, shown below, looks a lot like a Retina camera, but it uses 127 roll film.  1933 Kodak Vollenda - a very compact folding 127 film camera The Retina cameras are a somewhat bewildering adventure, as different models, such as the Retina I has many different versions, called types, that were produced in different years, with different finishes, lenses, and so forth.  To dig deep, there are several books on Kodak Retina cameras, but the McKeown's Guide is a great starting point.  The first Retinas arrived in the US in 1934, and were priced around $50 – a substantial sum for the time, and the US was still in the grips of the Great Depression.  Nevertheless, these optically superb, mechanically precise, and easily carried cameras gained a following.  What makes the Retinas special is that starting with the original Retina to the Retina IIIC, the cameras featured a folding bed, with the lens on a very short bellows, which makes them easy to carry with no protruding lenses. The front pops open which releases the lens to be able to shoot.  All of the folding Retinas feature Compur leaf shutters with the lens helical, shutter speeds, and apertures around the lens all on a front panel.  The Retina I cameras were guess -focus, unless you had an accessory rangefinder that fit into the accessory shoe on the top deck.  Rangefinder focus didn't start until the Retina II was introduced.  All models had fixed lenses, until the IIc appeared, and removable front lens elements allowed different focal length lenses from 35-80mm to be used. Due to the small throat diameter of the lens mount, fast lenses were not available, with 50mm f/2 being about as good as one could get. Of course, you could not retract the 80mm lens into the camera, so it had to be open all the time if it was attached.The folding Retinas feature shutter speeds from B, and 1-1/500 sec (early Retina I models had a max 1/300), and typically have Schneider Xenon lenses, which are as good as anything from the Leitz factory.  Later iterations, such as the IIIc, incorporated built-in uncoupled exposure meters. My personal favorite is the Retina IIa, which was manufactured from 1939-1954, and has a Retina Xenon 50mm f/2 lens.  It exemplifies the sturdy mechanics and straightforward control of manual cameras.  The closed camera can easily fit into a jacket pocket.  Depending on the model and type, the film advance is a wind-knob on top (Retina I), an advance lever on top (Retina IIa Type 016), or an advance lever on the bottom (Retina Ib, IIc, IIC, IIIc, and IIIC).Film advance lever on the bottomLater Retina versions, such as the IIc feature Exposure Value (EV) with linkage of apertures to shutter speeds.  For example, if your EV was 11, then any combination of aperture and shutter speed corresponding to that EV would be linked.  Changing the aperture also changed the shutter speed. You can find the same system on Hasselblad lenses. A simple form of automation that works quite well.  The non-coupled Selenium meters were accurate at the time, but today, finding one that works accurately is improbable.   If you have a Retina IIIc, THIS lens, the 35mm is the one to find.The rigid-bodied Retinas started appearing in 1959, with the end of the line folding Retina IIIC being made until 1960.  There were also Retina Reflex SLRs that incorporated a similar removable front-element lens.  I posted here about one of the solid-bodied Retinas a while back.The Retinette line of cameras were designed to be cheaper folding cameras with Kodak Anastigmat f/6.3 lenses and no meters or rangefinders.  They were made from 1939-1954, and other Retinettes were solid-bodied.Folding Retinas: Within the designations are many types, pre-WWII and post-war models with the same name, but a different “type” and you’ll need to see a reference on the variants in a book like McKeown’s Cameras 12th edition.    • Kodak Retina (1934-36)    • Kodak Retina I (1936-50)    • Kodak Retina Ia (1951-54)    • Kodak Retina Ib (1954-60)    • Kodak Retina II (1936-50)    • Kodak Retina IIa (1939-54)    • Kodak Retina IIc (1954-57)    • Kodak Retina IIC – (1957-58)    • Kodak Retina IIIc (1954-57)    • Kodak Retina IIIC (1957-60)Kodak 80mm Longar for the Retina IIIcAgfa/AnscoBut, hey, imitation is the best form of flattery, right? The Agfa corporation came out with the Karat series of 35mm cameras. Originally designed to use the Agfa Rapid Cassettes, these cameras featured a short bellows that held the lens and shutter (Compur-Rapid). They did not have a cover over the lens like the Retinas, but the design is quite similar.  The cheaper models had Agfa Solinar or Igestar lenses, but the more expensive models have Schneider Xenon or Heligon f/2 50mm lenses.  The Karat 36 used standard 35mm cassettes, so that's the one I recommend if you are looking for one. Under the Ansco name, it is called the Karomat.Zeiss IkonThe Zeiss Ikon Contessa 35 (1950-55) and Contina I (1951-55) and Contina II (1952-53) are also 35mm folding cameras. The Contessa 35 features a rangefinder, uncoupled exposure meter, along with a 45mm f/2.8 Tessar lens.  It’s a fantastic little folder, and certainly in the same league as the the better Retinas.  CertoCerto, in Dresden, produced a lot of roll-film folder, but only a few 35mm models – Dollina (1930s), the Durata (1949) and Durata II (1951).  BaldaBalda, in Dresden, Germany, produced a folding 35mm camera in 1950 named the Baldalette, which looks a lot like the folding 127 roll film cameras that were produced pre-war.  One that stands out is the Jubilette (1938) – a very non-Balda name, which came about for the 30th anniversary of Balda-Werk.  Later 35mm folders were called the Baldini, Baldinette, Super Baldina, and Super Baldinette.  I can only speculate that the Balda did not sell well in English-speaking counties, because damn, those stupid names!  Of course, I have a follicularly-challenged friend that enjoys his Balda folder.  BeierBeier, also from Dresden, produced the Bierette in 1939, and the sleek design is much different than all the other 35mm folders listed here.  I should note that most of the Dresden-based companies became part of VEB Pentacon in the 1950s.  WeltaWelta, another German company, produced 35mm folding cameras that are similar to the Retina I from Kodak – named the Welti, which first appeared in 1935, featured several different iterations with 50mm lenses, Compur-Rapid shutters, and either an f/2.9 Cassar, an f/2.8 Tessar, an f/3.5 Xenar, or an f/2.4 Xenon lens.  Other Welti models followed, and were made into the early 1950s. The Weltini and Weltix are also folding 35mm bodies.  The folding 35mm cameras from Balda and Welta are not common on this side of the Atlantic, and certainly are not well-known.  Again, Welta doesn’t look like a great name in the English language.   Weltini sounds like the name of a circus performer.  \"The great Weltini will amaze you with his Compur-Rapid shutter. \" VoigtlanderVoigtlander, which made a dizzying array of camera models, released the Vitessa in 1950, and those cameras have a “barn-door” opening, and feature a big plunger to advance the film and cock the shutter.  The Vitessa models are interesting, but like many (but NOT all) 1950-60s Voigtlander cameras, they are prone to be mechanically problematic. You will find them with either Color Skopar f/2.8 50mm or Ultron f/2.0 50mm lenses in Synchro-Compur shutters. An earlier 35mm camera known as the Vito lacked a rangefinder, but is more similar to a Retina I. The Vito III is a beautiful rangefinder camera that commands pretty good prices to match.  Buying your 35mm folderThe beauty of these folding 35mm cameras is their compactness when the lens is retracted, and in the case of the any camera NOT Agfa/Ansco, a front door protects everything behind it.  If you are looking for a classic manual rangefinder camera that does not start with the letter L, many of these folding 35mm cameras are excellent alternatives.   One of the modern shoe-mount digital light meters makes the perfect accessory.  The prices for most of the Retinas on eBay are pretty low, especially compared to something from Leitz.  A nice Retina IIa typically sells in the $50 range, which is a steal for such a wonderful camera.  Other models such as a IIIC can sell for a bit more, but generally, they are undervalued in today’s market.  A model such as the Welta Weltini II can sell for about $100, but they are uncommon, which adds to the price.  Cameras from Balda and Welta are more common in European markets.I should add here that I once owned a Retina IIa that was previously owned by Harold Edgerton of MIT, who developed the Xenon flash for cameras. Hence, that's why it is called \"X\" sync.   I picked it up at estate auction of  a Detroit area engineer who must have purchased it from Edgerton.  I wrote about it in 2011, when I used it with of course, a flash unit.My choice for anyone wanting to find a Retina, is to look for a IIa, as it does not have a light meter, and it's very compact with a wonderful lens that will produce excellent images.  For about $50, you'll have a wonderfully compact 35mm rangefinder camera.Retina ResourcesI consider my post to be an introduction to the genre of 35mm folding cameras.  Aside from printed resources, check out these links for more Retina and folding 35mm information:Chris's Camera Pages  - All the Retinas! Balda Jubilette informationMike Eckman's Wetini II reviewMike Eckman's Certa Dollina II reviewPhoto Jottings Retina IIIC reviewJim Grey's Retinette II review Mike Elek's Retina History Camera Collector Pages - Retina FamilyKaren Nakamura's Photoethnography Retina pages"},
{"title": " The Samoca 35 IV - a diminutive gem.", "date": "Monday, May 23, 2022", "text": "I've seen Samoca cameras only a few times in the past 20+ years, and always at either a thrift store or a camera swap.  The small size, and oddball appearance didn't do much for me at the time, and they stayed on the seller's shelves.  However, a Samoca IV recently came my way, and I was intrigued.  The earliest models from Sanei Sangyo K.K. in Japan are much smaller than your typical 35mm camera, and appeared in the early 1950s as the optical industries in Japan were recovering from WWII.  By the mid-1950s it was known as Samoca Camera Co. Ltd., and the cameras were all  named Samoca, followed by the model designation.  If you are collecting vintage cameras, Samoca isn't a brand that you are likely to encounter, as they ceased operation by the early 1960s.  The logo is a set of three As in a stylized mountain shape.  According to McKeown's Cameras, there were less than 20 different cameras manufactured, and the last ones were released in 1962.The Samoca 35 through 35 IV models are compact Bakelite-bodied 35mm viewfinder cameras with metal top and bottom plates and a front panel that contains the lens and shutter mechanism. They all have a cold shoe, Ezumar 50mm f/3.5 lens with a minimum f/22 aperture.  The shutter speeds are B, 1/25- 1/200.  The Samoca 35 IV was produced in 1955 and features a PC flash sync.  Focus is scale focus (guesstimate), not rangefinder.  The shutter is cocked by pushing down a plunger on the left front, and the shutter release is on the right.  A strange little camera, but wait, there's more!  The back of the camera is removed  to load the film and watch out for the film take-up spool, as it will easily fall out. A chrome film pressure plate must be flipped upwards before loading film - just like a Rollei 35.  The standard 35mm cassette is loaded on the left, and once the film on the take-up spool has been engaged, flip down the pressure plate and reattach the back.  To advance the film, press down on the shutter cocking post and turn the knob until it stops.  Now, you can focus, set your shutter speed and aperture (all manually, of course).  I just used sunny-16 and had good results.  Press down on the shutter button and the very, very quiet shutter does its thing. The Samoca 35 IV features 5 shutter speeds besides B: 1/10, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100, and 1/200 sec.  The Ezumar lens is a triplet and coated.  The rewind the film, you can either hold down the shutter cocking plunger while rewinding, or push in the metal flange behind the plunger.  I found that a bit of washi tape was essential in holding the end of the film in the take-up spool. When you look at the small Samoca 35 cameras up close, it's apparent that they are actually quite ingenious in operation and are constructed quite well. While not as complex as say, a Canon IIF of the same era (a Leica copy), their simplicity and diminutive stature really makes them stand out among other 35mm cameras.  Compare them with contemporary US-made Argus cameras, and it's obvious how innovative the Samoca cameras were.I loaded my Samoca 35 IV with an old roll of Svema 100 b&w film.  I made some exposures around our yard, and then took it with me to the Asheville River Arts District (the RAD).  The RAD is always a great place to test a camera, as it's interesting, and only a 10 minute drive from my house.  I used Sunny-16 to assess my exposures, and guess at the distance.  However, on a sunny day, I was using an aperture of f/11-f/16, so distance estimate did not have to be precise.  I developed the Svema 100 in HC110 dilution B.  As I hung up the negatives to dry, I could see that the camera performed well.Some examples from the negative scans- all done on my Epson V700 scanner:Overall, the Samoca 35 IV did very well, and it was easy to use. There's a whole bunch of interesting 35mm cameras from post-war Japan and Germany that don't sell for crazy prices.  Samoca is certainly not a well-known brand, and if one wanted to pick a manufacturer that is an interesting one to collect, Samoca would be a good choice, as most of their models don't sell for exorbitant prices, and there are only a few that are really rare, commanding prices close to $500.  Most of the 35 series sell for less than $50. To find out more about the Samoca 35 series, this site is a great place to begin."},
{"title": "Don't do this...", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2022", "text": "I was recently processing a bunch of cameras for the FPP donation program, and brought back some problematic cameras to see if I could figure out what was wrong with them.  I often run across these Mamiya/Sekor DTL 1000 and DL500 SLRs in donations, and at one time, they were fairly reliable M-42 screw mount SLRs with spot and average metering.  Unless you have a manual,  you may never figure out how to turn on/off the meter (pull the film advance out towards you and to turn it off, press the top of the base of the advance lever and that retracts the lever back to the body).  Anyhow, about half of the time these cameras have non-working meters, although they work fine without a battery for fully manual shutter speed/aperture functions, and you can use sunny-16 or a separate meter. This particular camera is pretty much dead, with a seized shutter. However, as soon as I pulled it out of the box, I figured something was odd about it, as the Vivitar lens is a much later model that is commonly seen on k-mount cameras like the Vivitar V3200.  As I looked closer, I could see that the lens was epoxied to the lens mount.  Whoa.  I pried the lens off with a small screwdriver, and it lifted asway fairly easily. Yes, some previous owner had gone through the trouble of filing off the K-mount back end and then epoxied it to the M-42 mount face.  The crazy thing is, M-42 lenses are cheap and plentiful, and I am not sure why anyone would go through all this trouble t put a cheap lens like the Vivitar on an old M-42 body.  Maybe it was a very specific hack to give that result, but I really suspect it was a mess to begin with.  Needless to say, this one is a parts camera.I previously reviewed a DTL 1000 in 2012 - and you can read it here. These cameras are under-appreciated today, but they were quite good in their day.  As someone that appreciates the M-42 SLRs, I find the Mamiya/Sekor DTL 1000 to be not as well-built as a Pentax Spotmatic, and more similar to a Minolta SR camera in features and ergonomics, as well as build.  Mamiya went through a series of 35mm SLR designs, but were never able to duplicate their success in 35mm as they did in medium format."},
{"title": "  A Visit to the Camera Heritage Museum", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2022", "text": "There are not many museums devoted entirely to cameras, and I have only been to less than a handful of photographic history museums: Eastman House in Rochester, NY; The Argus Museum in Ann Arbor, MI; The American Photographic History Museum in Pittsburgh, PA, and now, the Camera Heritage Museum in Staunton,VA. Two of these museums are dedicated primarily to products of a single manufacturer - Kodak  (and of course, so much more) for Eastman House, and Argus, of course, at the Argus Museum - which has the distinction of being also at the site where the cameras were made.  The latter two museums are of wider representation, and of these, the Camera Heritage Museum by far, has the most diverse and comprehensive collection of cameras that I have seen.  I stopped in Staunton last year, unaware of there being a camera museum there, and because we arrived late in the day, it was closed.  However, I knew that I would be passing by Staunton again, as it is off Interstate 81, not far from Lexington, VA, and on my way to the Film Photography Project HQ in New Jersey. On May 2, I was able to stop and spend a good deal of time before I had to hop back on the highway to NJ.  I met David Schwartz, the curator, and the person who has amassed a mind-blowing collection of cameras starting in 1968.  Located in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, Staunton is a charming place to visit with a lovely downtown with lots of shopping and dining options.  The Museum, which started out as a camera store, is open to the public, and a small fee gets you a self guided tour of the collection, and an Andrew Jackson gets you the curator-led tour, by Mr. Schwartz.  I opted for that, which also comes with a packet of information.  At the outset, I informed David of my experience with the world of vintage photography and intentions of doing a review.David Schwartz, curatorThe Camera Heritage Museum houses close to 7,000 cameras as well as photographs, advertising materials, vintage products and supplies, and other ephemera. There are numbered stations that feature items of importance in the history of photography, and David was of course, well-versed in all of them.  I did learn some things that I was unaware of that had to do with local involvement in the growth of photographic technology, and to see certain cameras that were previously owned by famous photographers was a treat.   While initially overwhelmed by the sheer number of cameras, I soon saw the organization by type and era, and amid all the glittering chrome, I found many wonderful examples of cameras that I had never previously seen in person.  The whole gamut of the history of analog  photography is represented -- from Daguerreotype cameras and images to the end of the development of film cameras.  My images show - every case is chock-a-block with cameras.  Among those I saw a beautiful, mint-condition Kodak Ektra - the most complex and expensive 35mm camera made by Kodak. American manufacturers were represented by Argus, Kodak, Conley, Ansco, Univex, Perfex, Graphlex, Ciro, Falcon, etc. The German camera makers -- Leitz, Zeiss Ikon, Rollei, Ihagee, and lesser-known firms was well represented, as well as the Japanese Nikon, Canon, Miranda, Topcon, Minolta,Pentax, Ricoh, Olympus, and others.  Stereo cameras from 16mm to 5x7, spy cameras of all sorts, miniature cameras, large format, medium format, wet-plate, dry-plate, Polaroid, folders, box, underwater, and toy cameras. About the only aspect that was under-represented was cine cameras.  However, aside from the Kodak Brownie 8mm cameras, they had an Arriflex that was used by Leni Riefenstahl to shoot movies of the 1938 Olympics and Nazi propaganda films.Exhibit 13 - ArriflexIt was interesting to see how many different models of the same Kodak camera, such as the Holiday Brownie, were made in the USA, Canada, Brazil, England, France, and Spain. Of course, the many colorful examples of the Art Deco Kodak Beau Brownie were on display, as were the multitudes of Kodak folders, box cameras, Instamatics, and two examples of the fantastic Kodak Ektra 35mm rangefinder.  If you are interested in Twins Lens Reflex - there are plenty to see.  I really got a thrill at seeing an actual Graflex KE-4 combat camera, which took 70mm cassettes.  It looks much like a GIANT Contax II camera, and was sometimes referred to as \"Gulliver's Contax.\"  A Folmer Graflex \"Big Bertha\" is on display - and at 40 inches long and over 30 pounds, it's hard to imagine using it to photograph baseball games, but it did.  I could go on - there are many examples of famous cameras, and anyone with a love for things photographic will find their favorites at the Camera Heritage Museum.  I think their exhibit of miniature cameras -spy cameras, such as the various Minoxes, Ricoh 16, Riken Steky, Secam Stylophot, Suzuki Optical Echo-8 (KGB spy camera), Minolta-16s, and a Tessina - is quite comprehensive, as is their collection of stereo cameras.  Whether your interest is in large wooden bellows cameras or the smallest spy camera, or anything in between, you'll enjoy the Camera Heritage Museum.The Camera Heritage Museum is a 501 C3 non-profit corporation, and while the collection has been growing since the late 1960s, it became a non-profit museum in 2011.  Its location in Staunton, VA meshes with the local history of photography, which goes back to 1847.  There are a number of other historical museums in the area, and of course, the Shenandoah Valley is full of history.  The current building certainly is filled to the brim with photographica, and as a former museum professional, I can see that it will take some money to make the exhibits more attractive to a wider range of visitors.  I really enjoyed talking with David Schwartz, and hope that the museum is able to secure funds to ensure its perpetuity.  It's more than a small regional museum, as it encompasses the history of photography, and has a world-wide collection.  If you have any interest in photography, the museum is definitely worth the visit. The museum accepts donations of photographic items as well as monetary donations. Excess inventory, duplicates, and items that don't fit with their mission are sold on their eBay store - camera-and-palette, which is definitely worth looking up.The Camera Heritage Museum is located at 1 West Beverley St., Staunton, VA. Take exit 222 off I-81 into the historic downtown. Museum hours are M-F, 9-5, and Saturdays, 9-2.  Phone number is 540-886-8535. Its web address is  www.cameraheritagemuseum.com  Admission is $5 - $20, depending on whether you want a self-guided tour, or a curator-led tour."},
{"title": "May 1 Musings", "date": "Sunday, May 01, 2022", "text": "Taken today, May 1.Well, here we are on the first day of May, and I am getting ready for a week away from home.  I'll be visiting the Film Photography Project HQ for a few days to record some sessions, and to also help with unboxing/checking of gear that has been donated to the FPP School donation program.  Then it's off to Amenia, NY, where I'll be for a few more days to visit family.  The drive from home this time will include a stop at the Camera Heritage Museum in Staunton, VA, which I saw last year, but it was closed by the time we stopped in Staunton.  I'll be giving a review of it here and on the podcast.I love the month of May because of all of the rich variations in the color green, and as I drive up the Shenandoah Valley along Rt 81, I look forward to enjoying the scenery.  Of course, the various green shades don't look as good in b&w film, but there are so many interesting textures of unfurling leaves and patterns that to see them in monochrome is a different experience than in color.  Rhubarb LeafJapanese mapleSpeaking of color, people are still having a difficult time finding C-41 color film in stock.  I know that there is some excitement about Kodak Gold 200 being available in 120, and it's good to have that choice.  However, I remember when it was exciting to actually see a NEW film stock from Kodak.  It's anyone's guess about what's going on with Kodak and Fuji, and whether it really is supply-chain problems, worker shortages, or accumulating inflation effects, the prices of film have really shot up.  I'm glad that I jumped in and bought a 50 roll case of Fuji Superia 200 in 2018, when I paid $2/roll.  Last fall, as I was getting ready for a trip to the SW, I bought a bunch of Kodak Profoto 100, so I am pretty much set for any color film shooting.  I buy most of my black and white film in 100 ft rolls, and whether it's Arista 100, Kentmere 400, Fomapan 100, or Kentmere 100, I pay far less than I would for Kodak Tri-X (which I really don't like), or Ilford HP-5 (which I prefer).  The Kentmere and Foma films give me good, consistent results that I can trust.   However, the oddball films like some of the low-ISO films from the Film Photography Project (such as the Yeti and the Blue-Sensitive) and the films from Rollei always have a place in my camera bag(s).  I am working on the next issue of Monochrome Mania - \"Strictly Botanical\" - which of course will be back to images and not gear, and I hope to have it ready by mid-summer.  I really appreciate the good comments that I get from readers of the latest issue - 35mm Toy Cameras, Issue No. 7, and copies of that are still available, though my Etsy store is closed until after I return on May 9.  Here in the mountains of Western NC, spring seems to last for months, and if I drive 20 minutes, I can go back in time a week or two, and see flowers in bloom at 5200 ft. that have come and gone here at 2200 feet.   I feel fortunate to be living here.  I still have a lot to explore in NC, and hopefully, some short road trips are in order in late May/early June.I hope that this month goes well for all of you!"},
{"title": "PhotoWorks 200 film - 20 years later", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2022", "text": "Last year, I picked up a few odd rolls of long-expired color film, and most of it was labeled Seattle Film Works with expiration dates from 2000 to 2002. At one time, Seattle Film Works (SFW) was known for their line of SFW-XL films that were actually Kodak and Agfa cine film with a remjet backing -- and SFW was the only place that would process that film.  I wrote briefly about Seattle Film Works in a previous blog post on ECN-2 process films.  Until the 1990s, SFW films were all ECN-2 stock, but in the mid-late 1990s, the company started switching to C-41 film stocks and did not change the process used on the film canister.  By the year 2000, SFW had morphed into PhotoWorks, with a change in the canister colors and design -- and indicated that the film was C-41. The other change was going from 20 exposure to 24 exposure rolls. Typically, when you sent your \"SFW-XL\" film to SFW, you received a \"free\" roll back with your set of prints. In the late 1990s, I used a fair amount of the SFW film and received prints, negatives and slides + the roll of film with every order.  In 2000, a lawsuit claimed that SFW engaged in deceptive practices by claiming the film, now C-41, could only be processed by SFW.  That lawsuit ended with PhotoWorks having to send out thousands of free rolls of the C-41 film to customers.  By 2011, PhotoWorks was gone, its customer list sold to Shutterfly.  The roll of PhotoWorks 200 was manufactured it Italy - hence it's Ferrania (Solaris) 200 film, and its expiration date was 05/2002.  That puts the film as being made around 2000.  Given its age, I figured that I would rate it at ISO 64.  I loaded the roll into my Ricoh ZF which I reviewed previously in my post on the Tucson Police Dept. camera. After I finished the roll, I developed it in the FPP C-41 kit.  Some of the images are presented below. Overall, I was pretty happy with the results, and the 64 ISO rating was really on target.  One of the unknowns with any long-expired film is how the film was stored for the past 20 years. More than likely, the film was in a camera bag in a closet, which at least means a relatively stable thermal environment. My experience with expired color films is that to never expect perfect results, and the higher the ISO, the less sensitive the film is over time, as dyes oxidize.  Without making a 1 stop loss/decade for adjusting the ISO, you'll definitely end up with poor results.  If this was the 400 ISO SFW, I'd probably shoot it at ISO 80.  For expired E-6 (slide) films, it's even more critical to test a roll, if possible,  before shooting anything serious. If the film was stored in a freezer or fridge for most of its life, then low ISO films such as Fujifilm Velvia 50 can often be shot at box speed, or at ISO 32-40. Ektachrome 400 should be rated at least at 200 -- if it was cold stored.  Again, part of the fun with long-expired films is to see what you'll get - but don't use them for once-in-a-lifetime shots.  With the access to color film seemingly restricted at this time, expired films are selling for a lot more.  Don't overpay!"},
{"title": "More Slow Color -  EASTMAN 5244 - ISO 1", "date": "Monday, April 11, 2022", "text": "You know if there is a low-ISO film out there to try, I will do so.  Ultrafine Online has the Motopix line of color films that are ECN-2 process cine films that are repackaged in 35mm cassettes for your still camera.  A while back, I purchased a roll of the Eastman 5244 from them. Rated at ISO 1, it's a tungsten-balanced film that was manufactured in the 1990s for use as a intermediate film for making master positives from Eastman color negative films and making duplicate negatives from those master positives.  To do this, the film has to be very fine-grained, have high sharpness and resolving power.  The film is on a clear acetate base, and has a remjet backing.Eastman 5244 (image from Ultrafine Online)The roll of 5244 sat around in my film box for a few months before I finally loaded it up in my Pentax Spotmatic F.  Here's the thing - of course my Spotmatic F does not have an ISO setting even close to  ISO 1.  Because the camera is all-manual, I could shoot it sunny 16 in full sun handheld at F/2 and 1/30 sec shutter speed. Here's how you can figure this out:If the reciprocal of sunny-16 for an ISO of 1 is 1 sec at f/16, then:f/11 = 1/2 sec, f/8 = 1/4 sec., f/5.6 = 1/8 sec, f/4=1/15 sec, f/2 = 1/30 sec., f/1.4 = 1/60 sec.That of course, is in full sun.  I also used an external meter and set my shutter speed and aperture accordingly when I used the camera on a tripod for some of the later images.You may think that one might want to use a warming filter over the lens as the film is a Tungsten-balanced emulsion.  That would only decrease the light, and make for longer exposures. I can always fix the colors post-scan if necessary. That said, the beauty of these odd films are the sometimes serendipitous crazy results that convince one that using these films presents a different avenue of exploration.I shot some of the roll two months ago and finished it up at the end of March, when our daffodils were coming into bloom.  I used a tripod for many of those shots, but the early ones were hand-held - hence the shallow depth of field, as you'll see.  I developed the film in the FPP C-41 kit, but first used a sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate pre-bath at 102°F for one minute, and then after pouring out the pre-bath, poured in several changes of water at the same temp, shaking that developing tank like a cocktail shaker. The first pour out will be really black, and subsequent rinses will go from gray/brown to light pink.  At that point, you are ready to do the  C-41 or ECN-2 developing.  The initial carbonate prebath is essential in removing 99.9% of the carbon remjet and not contaminating your developer. After hanging the film to dry, I used a photowipe on the base side of the film to remove any remaining remjet, of which little remained.  The film was scanned on my Epson V700 scanner, and files were opened in Corel PaintShop Pro, which has been my image editor for over a decade.  Hand-Held Results --Upper photo before adding a filter post-scan.Lower photo, after an 85B equiv. filterAs you can see, the film is extremely fine-grained, and in the photos below, I'll point out any that have been altered by filters.85B post-scan filterTripod-mounted resultsJust a bit of filtrationThis was pretty much a test of this film, and I should get more of it to shoot some colorful city scenes.  Shooting it indoors would be crazy, as it is so slow, and for photos of people - well in bright sun you could go f/4 at 1/15 sec if you dare.   However, it could be nice for shooting a 1 sec (or longer if not sunny) on a tripod to achieve a series of ghostly movements of people in a city landscape."},
{"title": " Paul and Reinhold 640 film - One Roll Review", "date": "Sunday, April 03, 2022", "text": "In 2020, Rollei films (MACO) introduced a film to celebrate 100 years of Rollei, which was found by Paul Franke and Reinhold Heidecke in 1920. Last year, I bought a two-pack of this film, which was marketed with an unusual 640 ISO rating.  Of course, as always, there have been numerous theories as to what this film really is, and to be honest, I have no idea, and I don't really care.  The label on the package says \"Made in Italy.\" Perhaps Maco has contracted to Ferrania to do the film cutting and packaging.   I'm sure someone with more knowledge has details, but everything so far has been conjecture.What I do care about is the film worth a repeated use?  Since the film comes in an attractive 2-pack container, the first roll was my \"test roll.\"  I'll add that I like the idea of the plastic snap-lid 2 roll container, which Adox also used for one of their films, the CMS 20.  Walking around with 2 in the can and one in the camera certainly makes it easier to not lug around more stuff. However, I digress.  Back to the roll of the P&R 640.I loaded the roll into my trusty Nikon F100, and did some photography in downtown Asheville and around Weaverville, NC. After finishing the roll, I developed it in Kodak HC-110 dilution B for 8 minutes.  I appreciate that the film lays flat and scanned very nicely.  Obviously a single roll doesn't always tell us much about how a film will perform in all situations.  The P&R 640 seems to have very good latitude, a bit speedier than a 400 ISO film, and very acceptable grain. I do think it's a very good choice for street photography, and really looks good from what I shot.From the Rollei film site:Nominal Sensitivity - ISO 640Fine-grain and natural contrastsExposure latitude from ISO 320-1600Excellent for available light, action & street photographySince the P&R 640 is a \"special edition\" film, it's probably sold out at the bigger stores, but I found that Blue Moon Camera has it in stock, so I have ordered more.  At other sites and on the Rollei film pages, it's out of stock, but should be available after the end of April, 2022. I consider it a good film for the types of photography that I do. It scans well, has great tonal range, and low grain.  What's not to like?Now, for some results:"},
{"title": " The Nikon Nikkormat - Today's Bargain?", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2022", "text": "As a 20+ year Nikon user, I've probably handled almost every Nikon film SLR that's been produced, except for an F5 and F6. It was probably about 21 years ago that I handled a Nikkormat for the first time -- a co-worker’s Nikkormat FTN.   About a year later, I acquired a Nikkormat FT2, which I used quite a bit doing macro and nature photography.  The fully mechanical Nikkormats differ from all other Nikons because the shutter speed dial is located around the base of the lens mount. If you have used an Olympus OM-1, you would feel quite at home handling the heavier and more robust Nikkormats.Shutter speed dial. Also note the cold-shoe over the prismThe first Nikkormats were introduced in 1965, and were sold as a cheaper alternative to the Nikon F.  You sometimes see Nikomats, which were for Japan's market, but are the same cameras in all respects except for the name on the front.  I suppose Nippon Kokagu thought of the Nikkormats as \"amateur\" cameras, since they were not a modular system like the F, yet they produced the same results.  Obviously, a lot of pros used them as well, since they were solid cameras at a lower price point.Nikomat, AKA NikkormatThe Nikkormats were designed to be reliable, robust SLRs with non-removable prisms, and with less bulk than a Nikon F with a metering prism.  They also differ from the F in having a Copal-square vertical metal shutter with speeds up to 1/1000 sec.  In addition, the back of the camera is hinged, making for easier film-loading.  THE NIKKORMAT LINE-UPNikkormat FTNikkormat FT -  1/125 flash, sync, ISO settings 12-1600, a cold-shoe is attached separately to the prism via a ring around the eyepiece. In fact, you often see FT's without a cold shoe attached.  Depth of field preview, mirror lock up, built-in exposure meter, X and M flash sync, 1.3V PX-625 mercury cell for the meter.  The FT requires you to also set the film ISO when you set the maximum lens aperture.  That inconvenience was fixed with the FTN model.Nikkormat FSNikkormat FS - basically a stripped-down version of the FT without a meter, so there are no indicators for exposure, and no battery. There is also no mirror lock-up. Since there is no metering, there is no indexing prong, making this camera able to use just about any F-mount lens, but of course, with no built-in metering.  They are less commonly encountered than any of the other Nikkormat models, and are now collectibles.  Still, using one is pretty simple, much like using a Nikon F with the eye-level, non-metered prism, but with 92% coverage in the viewfinder. I reviewed this camera in 2013.Black Nikkormat FTNNikkormat FTN - Introduced in 1967, it improved upon the FT with center-weighted metering, shutter speed seen in the viewfinder, and +/- indicators in viewfinder for metering.  Still, the cold shoe is an accessory.  Later production saw a plastic cover on the film advance lever.  This is the most commonly seen Nikkormat as the production run was from 1967-1975.  I have bought and sold a lot of them.Nikkormat FT2 - my current shooterBlack Nikkormat FT2Nikkormat FT2 - This model was produced from 1975-78, and featured a built-in prism-mounted hot shoe and the use of a 1.5V LR-44 cell for the meter. A locking film speed selector prevents accidental changes, and the PC flash connector will auto switch for X or M sync, if necessary.  This is my favorite model of the Nikkormats, and one that I always seem to have around at one point or another, if only to use some good old non-AI lenses.Black Nikkormat FT3Nikkormat FT3 - Produced for only a short time (1977-1979), as the Nikon FM was released in 1977.  The FT3 is auto-indexing, so there is no coupling prong on the front.  It uses a 1.5 v silver-oxide cell, and all other features are similar to the FT2.  It was the last fully-manual Nikkormat, and the last one with the shutter speed ring around the lens mount.Nikkormat ELNikkormat EL - The Nikkormat EL was introduced in 1972, and is a completely different beast from the fully manual Nikkormats above.  It uses a 6v PX-28 battery that inserts into the interior of the camera via the mirror box.  The shutter is an all-electronic Copal square shutter that requires power to function.  The EL is an aperture-priority camera, with shutter speeds of B, 4 sec- 1/1000 sec. There is no exposure compensation dial.  60/40% center-weighted metering, mirror lock-up, ISO settings from 25-1600, built-in hot shoe, and a battery test button.  The Nikkormat EL is roughly equivalent to the Nikon FE, except that it uses non-AI lenses, and is a more robust camera. The shutter speed is on a dial on the top deck of the camera where \"it's supposed to be\" like all other non-Nikkormat F series models.Nikkormat ELw - quite rare, and it was the first \"Nikkormat\" that could use an  autowinder, the AW-1.  It was only produced between 1976 and 1977.  I have never seen one in person. Nikon EL2 - nice if you can find one!The Nikon EL2 is often categorized with the Nikkormats. However, the camera has Nikon on the front, not Nikkormat.  It’s an AI body, so there is no metering prong as with the EL.  It also has an exposure compensation dial. It also had a short run of production, from 1977-78, most likely because the Nikon FE was the better option for an aperture-priority camera. It can also use the AW-1 autowinder.Nikkormats have ISO settings from 12-1600Using Non-AI  Nikon camera bodiesAny old-timers (like me) that have used the older Nikon bodies are familiar with the mounting of lenses on non-AI (non Auto-indexing) bodies - which would be the Nikon F, F2, and Nikkormats up to the FT2 and EL.  For these cameras, you need to do the \"Nikon twist.\" That involves the following:1. Set the aperture of the lens to f/5.62. make sure the indexing prong is properly situated at the front of the camera (at the index dot)3. Press the lens into the lens mount4. As the lens is inserted, and the bunny ears (indexing tab) have captured the indexing prong, twist the lens to the left, and then the aperture all to way to the minimum (f/16 or f/22) and then right, to the maximum aperture.This process tells the camera the maximum aperture of the lens, which is why they are called non-AI.  Non-AI lenses have solid bunny ears and no metering ridge at the edge of the lens barrel.  Auto-indexing (AI) lenses have holes in the bunny ears, as do AI-S lenses.  AI and AI-S lenses with the bunny ears can be used on non-AI bodies, but non-AI lenses cannot be used on most AI bodies because they lack the metering ridge.  In fact, unless a non-AI lens has been modified, it will break the metering tab on the body of the camera, with the following exceptions: Nikkormat FT3, Nikon FM, FE, EL2, and F3. In these cameras, a small chrome button at the edge of the lens mount is pressed to release the metering tab so that you can mount a non-AI lens - but you'll have to use stop-down metering for a proper exposure on those cameras.  The Nikkormats are solidly-built SLRs that are certainly quite reliable, but as the years have passed by, the major problem is that the resistor ring that controls the input into the light meter may have deteriorated, and there are no new replacement parts.  What I often see is what is called a \"jumpy\" meter.  The needle in the viewfinder will be erratic at first, and will sometimes settle down to what the true exposure should be.  If the resistor is in really bad shape, the meter will just give you a crazy value that is obviously wrong, or not move at all. The shutters are reliable, as are all other operations in the fully manual Nikkormat F series.  They are \"beasts\" that are certainly heavier than the Nikon FM and subsequent smaller-bodied SLRs. Yet, they have a retro charm that many people find appealing.  The clean top deck of a Nikkormat FT. Are Nikkormats a good buy today?Given the low prices that most of the Nikkormats sell for on eBay, I would say that if you are looking for a fully manual SLR, the Nikkormat FT2 and FT3 are obvious choices due to the use of 1.5V cells to power the meter.  You can use a 1.5V PX625A for the FT and FTN and adjust for the slightly-off exposure. You can also use an external meter, a phone app, or sunny-16 to shoot and not use a battery, or if the meter's not working.  I think the biggest drawback for novice users of these cameras would be the unfamiliarity of the non-AI meter coupling procedure.  Most of these cameras are around 50 years old or more, and although I have had many pass through my hands in good working condition, some of them have been affected by salt water corrosion, misuse, banged about, or just beat-up by years of use.  Four FTN bodies that I sold for parts/repairSince they are fully manual, with the exception of the EL series, there are fewer things to go wrong, and like any camera from the late 1960s to early 70s, caveat emptor.   Having said that, aside from the metering, most Nikkormats have a lot of life left in them. You can pick up a pretty nice Nikkormat FTN on eBay for less than $50.  Black models seem to sell for a bit more than the chrome ones.  A Nikkormat FT2 with a lens will sell for about $50-125, and an FT3 usually sells for $100-$175.  Nikkormat EL prices range from $25-150.Some Non-AI Lenses on the NikkormatsMy all-time favorite non-AI lens is the 50mm f/2.0 Nikkor-H.  While not as fast as the 50mm f/1.4 Nikkor-S, it is a lens with no aberration, extremely good resolution, and will close-focus to 2 feet.  It has a 52mm filter diameter, and has an aperture range of f/2-f/16.  They are easy to find on the used market, and definitely worth more than they typically sell for. The very earliest version of this lens will have Nippon Kokagu on the front, labeled as a Nikkor-S, with the focal length given as 5 cm.  The focus distances are in feet only.  It was the first lens to be released with the Nikon F in 1959.The letters after the Nikkor, such as H, S, etc., refer to the number of elements in the lens - Q=4, P=5, H=6, S=7, O=8, N=9. These designations did not carry over to the AI lenses and beyond. They are just called Nikkors.Non-AI lenses to have -20mm Nikkor-UD f/3.5 - amazing lens for its time, and that ultra-wide view is great. It has a 72mm filter thread.24mm Nikkor-N f/2.8 - 24mm is my favorite for wide without too much distortion.28mm Nikkor-H f/3.5 - fantastic normal wide without distortion. Compact, with great results.35mm Nikkor-O, f/2.0 - a larger lens than the 50mm, it focuses from 1 ft - infinity.  50mm Nikkor-S, f/1.4 - Pretty much an every-day lens, and with the wider aperture, great for low-light. There are two versions - one with sharply angled bunny ears, and one with the typical bunny ears.  I have one that was factory-modified to be an AI lens, and it's a wonderful lens to use on my Nikon FM3A.  55mm Micro-Nikkor f/3.5 - this is the original Nikon Micro-Nikkor, and it's as sharp as a tack with a minimum aperture of f/32! It focuses on its own to 1/2 life size and with the M extension tube, it goes to 1:1.  Great on a bellows, or with other sizes of extension tubes.85mm Nikkor-H, f/1.8 - A great lens for portraits.  The minimum aperture is f/22.  105mm Nikkor-P, f/2.5 - Fantastic lens that continues to be great for portraits, nature, etc.  Add an extension tube for great close-ups.135mm Nikkor-Q, f/3.5 - a more compact lens than the 135mm f/2.8, it's never as popular as it was in the 1960s.  Yet, it has its uses, and they are pretty cheap.  The 135mm f/2.8 is a huge lens with its a sliding lens hood.  If it matters, I find the Tamron 135mm f/2.5 Adaptall-II lens to be superior and smaller.200mm Nikkor-Q, f/4 - an  under-appreciated lens that works wonderfully with either a diopter or an extension tube for butterflies, etc.  There are several versions of this lens, but the original with the silver and black barrel typically sells for very little.  Minimum aperture is f/22.80-200mm f/4.5 Zoom-Nikkor-C.   A true zoom lens, with focus staying the same as you zoom in or out from your subject. Minimum aperture is f/32! Building a kit with all of the lenses above will likely cost less than one of today's digital mirrorless Nikkor zooms.  Except for the 20mm, all take 52mm filters.  They are made of metal and glass, with no plastic, no rubberized grip, and all-manual everything.  The later models, with a C designation, have better multi-coated surfaces, but all are excellent for black and white photography.For further reading:Peterson, B.

{"title": " Monochrome Mania No. 7 Available", "date": "Friday, March 18, 2022", "text": "It's taken me longer than I anticipated, but The Magic and Allure of Toy Cameras, Vol. 2 - 35mm, is now available from my Etsy store. At 40 pages including the covers, it's chock full of information and images of 35mm toy cameras, from the very first \"35mm\" the Kodak 00 Cartridge Premo, to the latest Reto Ultra Wide and Slim.   You can purchase The Magic and Allure of Toy Cameras, Vol. 2 - 35mm at my Etsy store.First of all, let me tell you about my journey with 35mm toy cameras.  Starting in 2000, when I was really becoming a student of photography - not in the literal sense as a student, but as someone serious about learning all that I could about photography, toy cameras were not on my mind as a creative tool.  I had grown up with the Kodak Instamatic as the camera that was close at hand, and when I got my first 35mm SLR, an Exakta Exa 1a in 1973, it was my every-day camera for a number of years.  My experience with \"toy cameras\" didn't really happen until the early 2000s, and when I started playing around with them, I found them to be fun adjuncts to the more serious Nikons and my Rollei TLR, and as I shot more with the Holga and other crappy cameras, I saw how they could become a real asset to anyone shooting film that wanted something out of the ordinary.  Over the years, I have always had my share of toy cameras, and when I published the third issue of Monochrome Mania that featured 120/620 toy cameras, I knew that a follow-up with 35mm cameras had to be done.  It turned out to be not as simple as I thought it would because there are so many more cameras, and I also needed to hunt down and purchase certain models that I knew had to be covered if I were to do a more complete guide to them.  some sample pages from MM #7.So, after quite a few more months, I had written a large part of the text, but it really wasn't until late in 2021 that the issue really started coming together. Some days. I would find myself down the Google rabbit hole pursuing information on cameras that just a decade ago, were brand-new, and now very hard to find.  I also knew that there was no way that I could test them all in time for the this issue, nor could I actually get my hands on every single model.  My goal here is to give the reader a good overview of the history of these cameras, with examples of the many types that have been available.  One could spend many years tracking down every example of a 35mm toy camera, and I'll leave that for some other soul.  I think that you will certainly get a lot from this issue, and I hope that I sell them all in a short time!Due to the full-color printing and the price increases in the publishing industry and postal rates, I have raised the price of MM #7 to $12 + $3 US shipping.  Friends tell me that I am underpricing this issue and should sell it for twice the price.  However, I want to keep it affordable for everyone so long as I cover my expenses and make a small profit.  The price certainly doesn't include the money I spent in obtaining cameras to test and photograph.  I'll recoup those expenses by selling many of these cameras in my Etsy store, so after reading this issue, be sure to check what I have on Etsy in a few weeks, as I start including some of the cameras in the zine in my Etsy offerings.I look forward to hearing from the readers what they think of this latest issue!This imageshot with this camera."},
{"title": " KODAK'S TRI-X SINGLE-USE CAMERA", "date": "Sunday, March 13, 2022", "text": "Last year, Kodak introduced their single-use camera loaded with a roll of Tri-X film.  I was initially skeptical, but finally ordered one from the Film Photography Project Store.  Seeing that I have been working on an issue of Monochrome Mania dedicated to 35mm toy cameras, I really had to try out this camera (the issue will be available in late March from my Etsy shop).  For starters, the phrase \"Kodak Professional\" on the front of this little plastic camera seems laughable, but just go with it.  The camera is pre-loaded with a 27 exposure roll of Tri-X, which is a 400 ISO black and white film. There is a built-in flash, so other than the film, the camera is similar to Kodak's Fun Saver series of cameras. I mostly shot outdoors, and only used the flash as a fill-flash and not as the sole light source, so I did not evaluate the performance in a dark indoor setting.  I suppose like any of these cameras, the small flash will be good for up to 10 feet.  The angle of view is wide, as the lens is a 30mm f/10, 2-element acrylic lens.  The focus distance is 1 meter to infinity.  I shot with the camera over the course of over a month, and its compactness allows it to easily fit into a shirt pocket, as well as any space in a camera bag. I should note that I taped a yellow gel over the lens when shooting on sunny days, so that I would not overexpose the image, and to achieve better tonality.  After I was finished with the roll, I opened the camera body and removed the film cassette, which other than the serrated top of the spool, looks like any other roll of Tri-X, and with the chrome cap ends. I developed the film in the FPP D-96 developer for 8 minutes, and did the standard fix and wash that I do for all my black and white films.  Overall, I have to say that I am pleased with the results.  Tri-X fell out of favor with me because the film base always cupped when dried.  That's a real pain in the ass when I am trying to load it into the Epson scanner  film holders, and films that lie perfectly flat are my preference.  Perhaps Kodak's made some changes, because this time, the film was almost perfectly flat.  The other factor is that the cameras are assembled in China, and maybe the film is made there, as well.  That could be a reason for the difference.If you are new to film photography, and want to experience shooting B&W, this is a good way to try it out.  I have seen prices in the $11-$14 range, so the camera is pretty cheap.  On the other hand, Ilford has a single-use B&W camera loaded with Ilford HP5+.  I've not tried the camera, but HP5+ is the film that I prefer over Kodak Tri-X.  The price for the Ilford alternative is in the same price range.   In addition, Harman sells a single-use camera loaded with Ilford XP-2, a C-41 film (that can also be developed in b&w chemistry).  Lomography also sells a simple-use camera loaded with 400 ISO Lady Grey film. If you just want a simple camera loaded with B&W film, you could get a Harman 35 reloadable which comes with 2 rolls of Kentmere 400 for about $30.  Three other choices for a simple to use camera with B&W film: Ilford B&W, Harman B&W, and Lomography MonochromeThe Harman camera w/2 rolls of Kentmere 400 is a good value.You CAN reload the Kodak camera with another roll of film, and if if you are careful opening the camera body, you'll quickly see how that would work.  It would probably be best to use a 24-exposure roll as the counter starts at 27.  I'll give it a try later on and see if it works with a normal cassette, or if I have to use the one with a serrated end to the film spool (like the one that was in the camera).  The wider view of the Kodak camera certainly is a plus, and I felt that the lens was plenty sharp enough. Of course, if you don't develop film yourself, The Darkroom Lab can develop it and you can get scans and prints from that roll of Tri-X.  Here are some examples from the roll of Tri-X, and I am quite happy with them."},
{"title": " YETI ANOTHER ADVENTURE IN FILM", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2022", "text": "Now available in the Film Photography Project Store, YETI  is the latest in their \"monster\" film series. What is the story behind the YETI?  I really don't know, but I think because the film is a glacially slow ISO 6, the YETI is the perfect \"monster\" to be the face on the film container.  It could also be based on Mike Raso's expression as he sits in the FPP HQ during the cold winter months.  However YETI arose, it's an interesting SLOW black and white film that is blue-sensitive (orthochromatic). The intended use for this film stock is in the cine world, where it was used for contact copying of titles and mats in motion pictures.  It has a very fine grain, and nice tonality, and since it's blue-sensitive, it makes for an interesting film for portraiture.   It should be shot in daylight for best results.YETI comes in 24-exposure rolls, which is probably best for these unusual films. It has a PET  (Estar) plastic base, so it light-pipes like crazy.  Store it in black plastic film cans and load in subdued light.  My experience with it has shown me that loading in direct sunlight is a real no-no.  So, load the film into your camera indoors, if possible.  Since it has an ISO of 6, you can only use this film in an SLR or a rangefinder camera where you can manually set the shutter speed/aperture/ISO.  Automatic cameras, such as point and shoots cannot be used with these low-ISO films.  If your camera can't go down to ISO 6, there are several ways to determine the correct exposure.  If your camera's ISO dial only goes to 25, and you have an exposure compensation dial, set it to +2 stops.  If there is no compensation dial, you'll have to manually compensate in the exposure.  You can use a light-meter app on your phone to determine the exposure if you want to go full manual.  You can also try sunny-16 if you wish, as follows:full sun at f/16, ISO 6 = 1/6 sec , therefore f/11= 1/12 sec (1/15); f/8= 1/25, f/5.6= 1/50, f/4= 1/100 sec f/2.8= 1/200 sec., f/1.4 = 1/500 sec.That's for full sun.  Make the appropriate changes for cloudy conditions, etc. So, on a sunny or cloudy-bright day, you can shoot this film hand-held at wide apertures.  On any other conditions, a tripod is recommended.  My favorite camera with these slow films is my F100 or my F4, since ISO 6 is available as a setting. That's because I'm lazy and don't like to extrapolate in my head with cameras that can't go that low, and since I like aperture-priority, it all works smoothly with  my chosen cameras.   I used my Nikon F3HP for the first roll, and as the ISO setting only goes to 12, I used +1 to +1.5 for the shots (compensating more when the subject was bright water). An external light-meter that can go to ISO 6 is not that common, but my iPhone light meter app goes to ISO 1.  Shooting films like YETI wide open on a sunny day gives you some creative possibilities that you just won't get with normal films.Orthochromatic films are also a different experience to shoot with, vs panchromatic films.  A blue-sensitive film means that reds will register as dark tones, so skin will be darker, and blue skies very light.  Again, slow and orthochromatic will be somewhat like shooting film in the late 1800s. A definite creative opportunity!YETI is one of the films that you really ought to try out. It develops easily in common developers, and unlike some high-contrast slow films, it has a normal tonality that does not require the use of special developers to achieve proper contrast.  I shot YETI film in situations that I might normally encounter, and I'm pretty happy with how they turned out.  I definitely will be shooting some urban scenes with it soon, now that spring has arrived and I'm exploring more in my area.I developed my YETI in D76 1:1 for 11 minutes for the first roll (images 1-3 below) and the second roll in D-96 for 7.5 minutes at 20°C for the last three images.Some examples from the two rolls that I shot."},
{"title": " A Tale of Three Films ", "date": "Sunday, March 06, 2022", "text": "I typically have a variety of film types in my camera bags, so that when I pick one up, it's ready to go.  The types of films I include in the bag usually reflects the cameras inside and the type of photography that I use them for.  For example, my small bag with the Leica M2 has b&w ISO 100 & 400 film, whereas my canvas shoulder bag often has the camera of the week that I am using, along with the right lenses, as well as a couple of toy cameras, etc.  Therefore, it has a variety of film types from color to low-ISO b&w.  On Feb. 25, we had friends visiting and I thought we might to go the NC Aboretum, so I grabbed the canvas shoulder bag.  I had to make a stop at the local post office first, and when I got back into the car I decided that we would go N instead, to Rocky Fork State Park in Tennessee.  It turned out to be the right choice, as everyone really enjoyed Rocky Fork, and the volume of water roaring through the creek was quite amazing.  My canvas messenger bag Unfortunately, the Nikon FM2N SLR that I had in the bag was loaded with Fomapan 400.   It was also a sunny day, which is not ideal for photographing waterfalls. Oh well, I had to make do, so I put on a 2X Neutral Density filter and a polarizer, so that I could take longer exposures in the semi-sunny conditions along  Rocky Fork.  Once I finished the Fomapan 400, I decided to use a slow film, so I pulled out a roll of Adox CMS 20 II, and loaded it. That was a mistake, in hindsight, as you'll see from the images.  After that roll was done, I used a roll of Eastman 5231 - an expired cine film that's a lot like Plus-X.  It's rated at ISO 80, so with a polarizer, I was still getting some good 1/2 second exposures.  Of course, I wouldn't know any of this until after I developed the film, and that's one of the things that I like about film - be prepared to fail, or succeed spectacularly.Rocky Fork State Park is a stream with a pretty exciting course through rocky terrain, and having been there a number of times, I know what sections are the most photogenic later in the year. But after some recent rains, just about any part of this stream with cascades of plunge pools, and white water is going to be photogenic. My trusty 22-year old Bogen/Manfrotto tripod has certainly been to its share of riparian scenes, and yes, if you want to shoot water scenes with long exposures, hand-held is not gonna do it, no matter what camera system you are using.  I started with the 24mm Nikkor on the FM2N, and then went to the 50mm. While I used the ND filter and the polarizer with the Fomapan 400, I just used the Polarizer with the Adox and Eastman films.The Fomapan 400 was developed in HC-110 B for 7 min, the Adox CMS20 II was developed in D76 1:3, for 10.5 minutes, and the Eastman 5231 was developed in D96 for 6.5 minutes.  The Fomapan 400 looks like it always does - grainy, but otherwise, okay.  The Adox CMS 20 was NOT the right film for this, though, and probably the D76 1:3, while one of the suggested developers  in the Massive Development Chart, it would probably have been better going with a Technidol-style developer, as the Adox film is very contrasty, and did not have much latitude. The clear polyester base really shows the lack of grain, but also the high contrast. I'll try this film again, but in a situation where the lighting is even, and also rate it at ISO 12 instead of 20.  The real champion that day was the Eastman 5231 film.  I have a large supply, thanks to my friend Bill Pivetta, and I look forward to shooting more of it in the future.  At Rocky Fork, it was the perfect film with great latitude, low grain, and in the mixed lighting (sun and shadows), it showed how great it really is.  This is not just a tale of three different films, it's a microcosm of the film world. Yes, I could have just shot Rocky Fork with my Nikon Df and not have to worry about film, and making adjustments as I worked the creek.  But you know what? By using film, I was learning something new, and creating a body of work that I can derive great satisfaction from.  It's not that the Adox film was a failure, it was just the wrong film for the conditions, and I learned from that.  The Fomapan was grainy, yet, I liked the effects that I got from it.  The Eastman 5231 is butter,  Smooth, creamy, and it really did well in the shadows and highlights. I don't want it to sound like I am knocking digital, but I could churn out a 100 digital images of Rocky Fork without even breaking a sweat and would have learned nothing new. Sometimes the journey IS the reward. Herewith are samples from the three films.Fomapan 400-Adox CMS 20 II-Eastman 5231--As you can see from the above, I did get some nice images from all three films.  However, the Eastman 5231 really performed the best when considering the overall exposure.  The shadow detail in the Adox is pretty bad, and the Fomapan 400 certainly did fine with the shadows, but one may not like the grain.  It's all a matter of taste and expectations."},

Within a few minutes of Google searching, I found the patent and the patent abstract:Camera Double Exposure Prevention SystemPatent number: 4595269 Abstract: A double-exposure prevention system for a still camera having a cockable spring-biased linear movable shutter-actuating slider operable between a cocked condition and held thereat by a latch movably responsive to a manually operated release member and thereafter upon release of the latch to a shutter-actuating position is provided with means for allowing one end of the slider to be rotated out of and away from the axis of the shutter-actuating movement throughout most of the subsequent rewind operation. While in this second angular position, the slider disables the operation of the release member, preventing accidental tripping of the latch after a cocking condition has been restored. During a small terminal portion of the film advance and after the preceding frame has been safely advanced so as to be out of the way, the film advance mechanism then rotates the slider back to its initial position.Type: GrantFiled: October 9, 1984Date of Patent: June 17, 1986Assignee: W. Haking Enterprises LimitedInventor: Wai C. WongYou can download and read the entire patent, if you wish.I'd heard of Haking, as the Halina cameras are attributed to that company.  From Camerapedia, I found:W. Haking Enterprises Ltd. is a camera and binocular maker based in British Hong Kong. It was founded by Dr. Haking Wong (1906-1996) and Dr. Pauline Chan in 1956. In 2002 the company was taken over by Dr. Tony Chak-Leung Tai & Dr. Tai-Chin Lo and built a new factory in Xinhui (Guangdong). Its camera products of the brands Halina and Ansco are distributed nowadays in the UK, Ireland, the Middle East and Africa by a company named Halina Imaging, that belongs to the British photographic distribution company SPS Logistics. Older cameras of Haking are marked as \"Empire made\"Makes sense that the camera is the ANSCO Pix Panorama, as Haking has rights to the Ansco name. But the patent?  I could see nothing in the Pix Panorama that makes it appreciably different from all the other simple 35mm plastic cameras with a lens cover that locks the shutter when its closed. The Pix Panorama came out in 1986-87, and Haking also sold the same camera branded as the Halina Panorama. It was also sold as the Hanimex Panorama 35, Suntone MM350, Arico Panorama CL-168 and Revue Panorama.  Without fully investigating all of the claims in the patent, I can only assume that it's just novel enough to be accepted.  But, for such a simple camera it raises questions. Do other makers of cheap plastic cameras (including Kodak) have a different mechanism or did they pay royalties to Haking for using the patent features?  Okay,  enough of the arcane world of patents and copyrights.  The Ansco Pix Panorama still remains one of my favorite 35mm toy cameras for three reasons:Viewfinder shows the panoramic field of view27mm 2-element lens removable pano maskI previously mentioned the removable mask in the post about a year ago : Widening Your HorizonThe 13x36 pano mask inside the camera can be removed to give a really nice 24x36 mm wide-angle negative. You can remove the front of the camera and mess with the viewfinder to give the full-frame view, but I never did that.  As a pocket pano camera, I think it's the best of the bunch, mostly because of the lens. The shutter is supposed to be 1/125 sec and an f/11 aperture.  On a sunny day, ISO 100 film will be fine.  Much has been said about the \"faux pano\" 13x36 cropped frame.  While no, it's not as good as say, a 24x72 pano frame, with the right film and lighting, your cropped pano images can be pretty good.  These cameras can be slipped easily into a pocket, and will surprise you with their results.  I've had an ANSCO Pix Panorama since at least 2005, and in searching for older images to be included in my forthcoming 35mm toy camera issue of Monochrome Mania, I found a lot of images that I'd forgotten about.  I'm all about cheap panos, and this camera will get more use this year, I promise.  Here are a few images from years past:2006, Ilford Delta 4002006, Ilford Delta 4002006, Ilford Delta 4002007, Ilford HP-5+2007, Ilford HP-5+2007, Ilford HP-5+2007, Ilford HP-5+"},
{"title": " The RETO Ultra Wide & Slim - all hail the return of a classic!", "date": "Saturday, February 12, 2022", "text": "The new Ultra Wide & SlimIf you weren't a photographer in the 1990s, it's probably because you were too young or it just wasn't your thing at the time.  Vivitar brought out the Ultra Wide and Slim in the mid-90s and the camera became a cultish phenomenon.  Originally manufactured by the Chinese company Sunpet (and who knows, the same company may be making them now), the 22mm lens, simple use, decent results, and shirt-pocket size contributed to this camera becoming quite popular among the younger set.  Then, it dropped out of sight for a few years, to be replaced by the Yellow Peace Camera with the \"super fat lens,\" thanks to the Japanese company, Superheadz.  I bought one in the early 2000s, and still have it, though I haven't used it in a long time because the soft plastic coating on the camera has turned to a sticky mess that's worse than a Nikon N80's grip. Considering that these are cheap cameras that are not expected to have a long life, I guess the degraded coating was never a thought. I am ALMOST finished with my 35mm toy camera issue for Monochrome Mania, and I quickly snapped up the new RETO version of the Ultra Wide and Slim when I saw them for sale on Amazon. Two days later the camera arrived in a padded Amazon envelope, and I eagerly opened up the package.The old Yellow Peace Camera from SuperheadzFor starters, the RETO UW&S is packaged just like you would see in a store, able to be hung on a display rack.  Inside the small box is a wrist strap, instructions, and a soft cloth pouch to store the camera within.  If there was such a thing as \"new camera smell,\" I would have welcomed it, but there probably is not enough mass of plastic to do that.  I have the \"murky blue\" versionAfter I photographed the new camera (to be included in the zine), I loaded a short roll of Ultrafine Extreme 100 (Kentmere 100) b&w film. I used a 24-exp roll because the original Vivitar model had a problem winding on with 36 exposure rolls, and I doubt that the RETO version is any different. This camera has an f/11 lens and approximately 1/125 sec shutter, so on a sunny day, ISO 100 film is perfect.  That 22mm lens really is quite good, and for a price of less than $30, the RETO UW&S is a great buy in today's market. Once you get out with this camera, it's easy to see why it became a sought-after classic, even if it was a \"toy camera.\"  The wide angle lens does quite well, so long as you don't get the sun in the frame. There is no flash, so this is a daylight-only camera, unless you want to put in some Kodak T-Max P3200.I took the RETO UW&S out over a couple of days and shot a variety of scenes with it.  The thing to keep in mind with any low-fi 35mm camera is that simple compositions work best.  Fine details don't always look so great, so a strong composition is a good idea.  However, this camera's lens is pretty sharp, as you can see from the shots below.  I developed the roll of Ultrafine Extreme 100 in D-96 for 8.5 minutes, and I have to say that the negatives look great.  Here's a few examples from my roll.As you can see, the images are fairly sharp, there's a bit of vignetting, and the exposures are satisfactory on 100 ISO film. The very top photo was partly cloudy, but I think it really captured the scene.  You can purchase the RETO Ultra Wide and Slim from just about any photographic online store, such as the Film Photography Project Store, What would really be nice is to see these on the racks in major retailers, photo stores, and gift shops.  This is a fun camera to take everywhere."},
{"title": " What is Etude Pan 400?", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2022", "text": "As you can tell from many of my previous posts, I like to try out different films.  Last September, I received a package from Cameractive, an online store based in China. Aside from the two light meters inside, which I have already reviewed, were two packages of black and white 35mm film - Etude Pan 400.  Now this was something that I'd not heard of before, and with my searching online, I found  it's a brand sold mostly in China.  Still, what the heck is it?  A bit more sleuthing, and it's most likely repackaged Ilford Pan 400 - another film that I have not tried.  It turns out that Ilford only sells the Ilford Pan 400 - considered to be a \"consumer\" film, to markets in Asia and Europe, and  it's regarded as a film for photo classes, etc.  Given that there ARE  films that fit that criteria in the USA - such as the Arista brand, it seems a bit odd that Ilford does not market Ilford Pan 400 here in the US.  Is it the same as the Kentmere Pan 400 (aka Ultrafine Extreme 400)? Based upon the times for developing, it's definitely not Kentmere Pan 400!Anyhow, I shot a roll of the Etude Pan 400 with my Nikon FM3a back in October during my trip to Arizona.  I developed it in Kodak's HC110B for 7 min.  Based on my results, I feel that it's certainly not the same film as Kentmere 400, as it has a lot more grain.  I'd rate the Ilford Pan/Etude Pan 400 as being somewhat similar to Fomapan 400.    With so many  boutique films being sold these days, it's often difficult to attribute any given brand to the actual film stock.  I can say that the Etude Pan 400 is certainly a different emulsion than other Ilford/Kentmere brands that I have tried - perhaps a bit more like Kodak's Tri-X.  I have one more roll to shoot, and I'll try a different developer just to see if it still has as much grain.  Overall, I would certainly not hesitate to shoot with it, but as with any film, you may find that you like it better than some other emulsion -- or not!   Since you won't find it for sale in North America, your best best is to find it on eBay, where the seller will likely be from China.  From Route 66, Adrian, TX.From  the Valley of Fire, New Mexico"},
{"title": "The  Winpro 35.  The birth of the low-fi plastic 35mm camera.", "date": "Saturday, January 29, 2022", "text": "I'm working away on my 35mm toy camera issue, and this camera profile is a bit of a teaser from what I am doing.  I think the grandfather of modern 35mm plastic cameras was the Winpro 35, introduced in 1947 by Webster Industries, of Rochester, NY.  It incorporates a single element 40mm f/7 Crystar lens with Instant and Time shutter speeds, single aperture and simple viewfinder in a Tenite plastic body.  It sold for $10.95 in 1947.  Still, a reasonable sum at the time. Kodak introduced Tenite in 1929, and it is considered the first modern thermoplastic.  The camera was advertised to be nearly indestructible by its designers, and in fact, they showcased the camera after having dropped it from a tall building.  Later iterations of the Winpro 35  featured several apertures and a flash connector.  The whole idea of the Winpro 35 was an inexpensive and reliable 35mm camera that was priced below the offerings of Argus and Kodak in post-WWII America.  Webster Industries sold at least 150,000 Winpro 35 cameras between 1947-49 and sold their patents to another group that eventually renamed themselves as the Zenith Film Company.  Zenith offered a color slide film based on expired Kodachrome patents, which they called Dynacolor.  Unable to retain the quality control of the earlier Winpro 35s made by Webster,  Zenith reached its nadir by 1952, where remaining Winpros sold for less than $8 at closeouts in Rochester area photo stores. [Glass Brass & Chrome, 1972;  Webster Museum page]  My Winpro 35 is a later model, sold by the Zenith Film Co.  I purchased it on eBay for about $30, which is an average price for the camera in today’s market.  As you can see, the wind and rewind, and exposure counter are all on the bottom.  The camera strap wires hold the clam-shell body together.  The tiny viewfinder is centered over the lens. There is no tripod socket.  The three numbered apertures are probably f/7, f/11, and f/16.  I loaded the Winpro 35  with a roll of Ilford Pan-F, which at an ISO of 50, should be the ideal match for this camera.   I shot a few photos with it last September with a bunch of photographers from the Asheville area during a photo walk in Marshall, NC.  It sat on the shelf until recently, when I realized that I had not developed the roll.  Seeing there was still some film left, judging by the exposure counter, I shot a couple of images on the B setting in my study/studio. Using the camera was not difficult - the camera actually works quite well, and I appreciate its ingenious design.I developed the Pan-F in D76, and scanned the negatives with my Epson V700 scanner. The results were not as good as what I would get from a modern single-use camera, but they actually look like they were taken quite a while ago.indoors, not so bad.For the outdoor shots, I think I would have done better with an ISO 100 film.  The indoor shot was on B, and might have been 2 sec  at most.  The lens is prone to flare, and perhaps there's dirt and haze inside.  Maybe the price wasn't low enough in 1947 for this camera for it sell well.  Maybe it should have been $1.99.  Image-wise, it leaves a lot to be desired if you expected it to compete with something like an Argus A. However, as a toy camera, it's got atmosphere in spades!  The simple design predates the plastic craptastic wonders of the 1980s-2000s, and it is a lot sturdier than the ABS plastic cameras of today.For more information on the WinPro 35, check out the following sites:Webster Museum - Chasing Down the WinProMike Eckman's website - Zenith WinPro 35Collection Appareils - Zenith Film Corp.And of course, the fantastic book - Glass, Brass, & Chrome by Lahue and Bailey, 1972, Oklahoma Univ.

I really love the cardboard packaging for the cassette, and it even has a QR code on the top that takes you to their web site so that you can get the developing information.  I think that's something every manufacturer should do.  The film comes in a 36-exposure roll, which I greatly appreciate.  I'm someone that goes through a lot of film in a year, and I prefer the longer rolls.  The film cassette does not have a DX code, so it's not a good choice for one of those point and shoots that rely on the codes to detect the ISO.  However, since most of my cameras require me to set the ISO manually, it's not a problem.  I took my Nikon F3HP and went to downtown Asheville with it on Jan. 25, and shot the entire roll within an hour.  I developed it the next day in HC110-B for 6.5 minutes per the instructions,  Overall, I am pleased with the results, The film has some grain, for sure, and to me, it resembles Fomapan 400, which it certainly could be.  I also note that when there are specular highlights, there is some \"blooming\" going on, which I'll point out below. I wouldn't say that this film is a favorite, compared to my standby, Kentmere 400 (Ultrafine Extreme 400),  Ilford HP-5+ or  Kodak Tmax 400, but it's okay, and at the price it sells for, it's a good alternative b&w film to put in your camera.  If you like the way it renders a scene, then it's perfect!  One thing I really appreciated was the absolute flatness if the film in the scanner holder.  I love the packaging, and I hope that other film manufacturers will consider the cardboard cylinders.  Here are some results (scanned with an Epson V700):note the specular highlights on the trumpet!"},
{"title": " Minolta Hi-Matic G2 Review", "date": "Sunday, January 09, 2022", "text": "The Minolta Hi-Matic G2 was the next-to-last of the Hi-Matic line, appearing in 1982.  It's a zone-focus camera that is fully automatic, and while it has the Hi-Matic name, it has a largely plastic body, and yet retains a classic appearance. It's similar in controls and appearance to the Hi-Matic G, which was released in 1974.I don't mind fully automatic cameras, so long as I feel comfortable with them and have some idea about what settings the camera has chosen for me.  The Hi-Matic G2 has shutter speeds from 1/60 - 1/250 sec. (and I am not sure if its 2 shutter speeds or if there are others between 1/60 and 1/250), and the 38mm lens has apertures from f/2.8 to f/22. Like almost every other small camera of its type, the CdS light sensor resides just inside the front of the lens bezel, and turning the ring around the lens adjusts the ISO setting from 25-400. The zone focus has 4 icons, with the closest focus at 1 meter. It no longer says \"Rokkor\" lens on the front, just \"Minolta Lens.\"  It accepts 46mm screw-on filters, and since the light meter sensor will be behind the filter, it will automatically compensate the exposure.  Next to the Auto setting on the lens, are a series of setting with guide numbers that are to be used with a flash.  The flash will sync at any shutter speed. Other than the focus scale, ISO setting, and guide number setting, there are no user-adjustable controls (see below).  This is truly an automatic exposure camera.  Although the camera does have a tripod mount, there is no B setting or way to attach a remote shutter release to the camera. It slips easily into a jacket pocket, though.Power-wise, the camera originally called for a  Mercury PX-675 cell, but using a modern alkaline 1.5V equivalent does not seem to be a problem, as the exposures I had looked just fine.   In use, the camera is very compact and is really easy to shoot with.  I suppose one might call it a good snapshot or street camera, and they would be right.  You can make the Hi-Matic G2 an even more versatile camera if you wish to turn the Guide Number markings into something like a limited manual exposure.  By turning the camera from AUTO to the Guide numbers, the shutter speed stays at 1/60 sec, and the guide numbers set the aperture at f/2.8 (GN10), f/4 (GN14) f/5.6 (GN20), f/8 (GN28), and f/11 (GN40). Without a battery, the default shutter speed is 1/60 sec, so you could make it work pretty well with no battery and ISO 50-100 film, and adjust the aperture by the guide numbers.Since there is no on/off switch, keep the lens cap on when storing the camera so that 1.5v cell doesn't discharge.  Overall, I was happy with the images that I got from the Hi-Matic G2.  It's one of those cameras that has an appeal to people that value well-designed, easy-to-use cameras that can be ready to shoot with in an instant.  The only drawback for me, is the relative lack of control over the exposure settings, but the camera did okay with the conditions that I used it in.ImagesThe color shots are from a roll of Fujifilm Superia 200, shot in 2021, and the b&w shots are from Fomapan 100, which I shot in January 2022.Waynesville, NCWaynesville, NCcamera geekeryLong's Chapel, Weaverville, NCfence and barn, Buncombe Co., NCGreat place to eat, Biltmore VillageAll Souls Cathedral, Biltmore VillageAll Souls Cathedral, Biltmore VillageAngle Street, Biltmore VillageSale, Biltmore VillageIt's certainly an easy to carry-around zone-focus camera that might be just the thing for many photographers that want something better than a Harman 35 simple-use camera."},
{"title": "  The Cooldark V102 Light Meter - The tiniest of them all?", "date": "Friday, January 07, 2022", "text": "Back in September of 2021, I received a package from Cameractive, an online store based in China.  In it, were two light meters for me to test and review.  The first one, the Doomo-D was reviewed several months ago here on RCB.  The second meter, a much smaller unit, the Cooldark V102 light meter, took me some time to get around to testing it. Cooldark V102 light meter mounted in the hot-shoeIf you do any searching for shoe-mount light meters, you’ll come up with quite a few new meters that have only recently been available.  I have already reviewed the DOOMO-D which features analog dials to get a reading, much like the Voigtlander VC II.  A different class of light meters, which seems to have originated with the Raveni Labs light meter, utilize a small OLED screen with the controls being several buttons on the top, with a front-facing sensor.  When I say tiny,  they are barely larger than the flash shoe they mount to.  A good review of a series of  shoe-mount light meters is on 35mmc. My primary concern over the Raveni Labs meter was the fiddly nature of the controls, and of course, their size, and the price.  It’s bad enough that I have a problem with texting.   Second, was my fear that the display would be hard to read in full sun. So, I put off buying one when they first appeared.  When the Cooldark 102 meter arrived to review, I was soon away for a long trip to the Southwest, and didn't test it right away. Finally, in Nov./Dec. 2021 I had the time to test the meter and give it a whirl.The Cooldark V102 Light MeterI wasn’t familiar with the name, but I was intrigued by the small size.  It’s barely over an inch wide, and what’s immediately apparent is a small USB port on the left side.  This meter has a rechargeable battery that is charged via the USB-C port.  Great idea!  The manufacturer claims 20 hrs of continuous use on one charge.  Since I only need it on for a few seconds at a time, that’s going to work fine for me.There is no instruction manual with the meter, but if you point your smartphone at the QR code on the package, it takes you to an online manual, which I printed out.  The page at Cameractive also has a diagram that shows the controls – which are pretty easy to figure out.  Specifications:    • Metering Angle: 30 degrees    • Aperture Range: F1-F64    • ISO: 6-6400    • Shutter Speed: 8s -1/2000s    • Dimension: 27mm x 30mm x 13mm    • Battery Capacity:120mAh    • Battery Life: 20hrs non-stop    • Weight: 12 gramsOf course, it weighs next to nothing!  After I charged it up – I pressed the metering button (lower L) and the display sprang to life.  Setting the ISO, mode, etc., are accomplished by pressing the upper L button and the right side buttons adjust the settings.  Pretty simple.  The small metal buttons are easy to operate for me.  The meter has aperture and shutter priority modes, which is really all you need.  When it’s in Aperture Priority, the arrow is on the aperture setting, and if in Shutter Priority, the arrow is on the selected shutter speed.  It’s reflective metering, which is pretty much what we do most of the time.  This tiny meter also is priced right - $45, not including shipping.  I mounted the meter on my Ricoh 35 ZF, and was very pleased with the display being easy to read in most conditions – in really bright sun, I needed to shade the screen to read it.  The readings were consistent with my iPhone metering app, as well as with my Nikon FE2 that I was using.  I was originally concerned about the placement of the screen on the top and not the rear, but in use, it was perfectly fine.For a small camera, the Cooldark 102 meter is really perfect, as it doesn’t get in the way of anything. The only downside to such a small meter is that it could easily be lost – but as long as I keep it on a hot shoe, it’s not going to fall off.  I think it's a great choice to mount on a camera such as an Argus C3 or C4, Kodak Retina, and all those old fully manual cameras that have either a cold-shoe or hot-shoe and either a non-working meter or no meter at all.  At the current price, you may want to buy a couple of them.  Thanks to Zhang at Cameractive for sending this delightful little meter!"},
{"title": "Review -  FPP Blue Ultra Color Film", "date": "Wednesday, January 05, 2022", "text": "It seems that as film photography has roared back from the almost-dead, we are seeing some quite oddball emulsions popping up that we would never have seen pre-digital era.  However, while black and white film choices have expanded, color film choices from the big companies have shrunk, as Fujifilm has reduced the number of its color emulsions, and Kodak's color emulsions are much fewer than a dozen years ago.   Offsetting that of course, is Lomography and its stable of oddball films.  In addition, access to ECN-2 chemistry has brought some really wonderful color cine films from Kodak to the fore.  So, while the pre-digital era C-41 and E-6 films stressed color fidelity, we now see a number of unusual films such as Lomochrome Purple and Lomo Metropolis that do the opposite. In that vein, here is a color C-41 film from the Film Photography Project that is sure to be of interest.  FPP Blue Ultra filmFPP Blue Ultra is a low-ISO (ISO 3) color film with a pronounced blue shift and muted colors that is unlike anything I have shot. It's much like a duotone with the blue -purple and popping reds. Since it is so slow, it's a challenge to shoot without a tripod, but believe me, you can.  On a sunny day you can shoot wide open at 1/30 sec, giving you an opportunity to exercise your creativity.  The film comes in 24 exposure rolls, and it's obvious just by looking at the unexposed film that blue is dominant.  The film appears to be on a polyester base.  The sprocket holes do not look like cine sprockets, but normal 35mm film. There is no antihalation layer or remjet. Mike Raso sent me some rolls of Blue Ultra to test, and I shot my first roll with my Nikon F100 and my 50mm f/1.4 AF-D Nikkor lens.  The FPP suggests trying an orange filter, which I did also use, but more on that later.  I set the ISO to 6 (as low as it goes on the F100) and set the exposure compensation dial to +1 to give me an ISO of 3.  I went for a stroll in downtown Weaverville to test the film on a partly cloudy December afternoon.   Shooting at apertures of f/1.4 - f/2.8 allowed me to shoot without a tripod, and of course, I tried to choose objects and scenes that were well-lit by the sun.  I also went for shooting colorful compositions to see what I'd get.  I typically shot a scene with and without the orange filter to see the difference. After I was done with the roll, I developed it in the FPP (Unicolor) C-41 developing kit.  I really did not know what to expect, and after seeing the negatives, I have to say that I really like this film.  It is extremely fine-grained, and after scanning the negatives with my Epson V700 scanner, I'm even more impressed.  You want a different look? This film has it.  On top of that, shooting wide-open changes a lot about a scene.  contact sheet - non-filtered shots are yellow-ishThe film renders a scene bluish to purple, and reds are really nice.  Yellows are not seen. It sort of has a faded look to it, and using a photo editor to restore faded film won't work here, because part of the colors are actually lacking. When I used an orange filter, the colors are somewhat more punchy, but you also lose almost 2 stops of light when you need it most.  In addition, white areas look almost sepia, but more like a dark yellow, but not so much when in bright sun.   Another time I'll try a K-12 (yellow) filter to see what happens.  Saving the color images as grayscale to give you lovely black and white images isn't too bad a thing, either.  However, I really liked the results without any filtration the best.Here is a selection of images from the first roll.  This film is certainly worth a try!

{"title": " The world’s first auto-focus camera - Konica C35 AF", "date": "Friday, December 24, 2021", "text": "Introduced in 1977, Konica manufactured the first auto-focus 35mm camera, the C35 AF.  It was followed by the C35 AF2 in 1980, which really only differs cosmetically, with all features being the same.  I picked this camera up from a box of cameras that my brother-in-law gave to me in July.  All of them had been purchased at an estate sale by him for about $25, and he only wanted the Minolta AF lenses.  There was a variety of cameras ranging from a Nikon F to Instamatics, and all had been stored in a garage, with lots of accumulated grime.  This Konica C35AF2 was fairly cruddy, and had a severe battery corrosion problem.  At first I was going to toss it, but after a while I sat down with it, cleaned it up, and was able to remove the corrosion and battery gunk.  I was pretty surprised that it started working, and after a few months, shows no signs of unreliability.  About the C35 AF and AF2:Considering that this camera broke new ground in compact 35mm cameras, the price reflected that.  In 1981, B&H listed the Konica C35 AF2 for $115.95 Compare that to a Pentax K1000 with a 50mm f/2 Takumar lens that was listed by B&H for $139.00.  [January 1981 Popular photography]Specifications The Konica C35 AF is an auto-focus auto-exposure 35mm camera with built-in pop-up flash    • Lens: Hexanon 38mm f/2.8, 4 elements in 3 groups    • Shutter: Programmed leaf shutter with 3 speeds-- 1/60s, 1/125s & 1/250s    • Exposure: Fully automatic, 25 - 400 ISO,  ISO set by turning ring around lens.    • Meter: CdS    • Sensitivity: EV9 - EV 17 with 100 asa film    • Viewfinder: Bright Line 0.41 Magnification    • Underexposure warning light, Parallax Correction Mark, Focus measuring square    • Flash: GN14,  Exposure determined by range measured by auto-focus    • Film Winding: Manual lever-wind + rewind crank    • Dimensions: 132 x 76 x 54mm    • Weight: 375 gramsIn UseOf the many AF point and shoots that I have used over the years, the Konica C35 AF stands out as bridging the gap between the manual focus automatic exposure cameras such as the Minolta Hi-Matic G, and the auto-wind, auto-focus, auto-exposure cameras such as the Nikon L35 AF.   It was the first AF camera, and focuses from 1.1m to infinity.  It really does fit comfortably in the hand and is very quiet, due to the manual film advance lever.  If you are in a low light situation, a red led lights up in the viewfinder to alert you to use the flash.  I like that the pop-flash requires one to manually select it.  The viewfinder is bright with easy to see frame-lines and parallax correction markings.  I like that the body is sturdy metal and it has a bit of heft to it.  The filter ring on my camera is dented, otherwise I would use a skylight filter or a yellow filter with b&w film.  It normally takes 46mm screw-in filters, and since the CdS photo cell is within the front lens bezel, it would accurately meter with filters in place.  Okay, so how has this 40 year old camera worked for me?  I’ve shot two rolls of film with it -- a roll of Tasma NK-II 100 ISO b&w film, and a roll of really expired Kodak Royal 400 rated at 80 ISO.  Every image came out quite satisfactory, even the old Kodak Royal 400 (though I had to adjust the color for fade correction).    It’s not as full featured as one might hope, with only 3 shutter speeds, but under most situations it would work just fine, and the 38mm Hexanon lens is quite good. Right now, I have a roll of expired Kodak Plus-X in it.  It’s definitely a camera to have as an extra in the bag, and yes, it could be a pretty good street camera.  The only downside is that there is no automatic override or B setting.   However, it does what it is supposed to do quietly and competently.  The going eBay price for this camera is fairly low -- from $25-$85, depending on condition and whether or not it’s from Japan sellers.  It’s 40+ years old, so seals may need replacing (I did that, too).  If it comes with the original lens cap which blocks the viewfinder, that’s a plus.  That’ll keep you from shooting with a lens cap still attached.I am glad that I took the time to get this camera working.  It’s easy to use, images are in focus, and the lens is great.Images:"},

You can have a 20 x 30 inch colorful photograph that was shot with the latest and greatest technology, and it can be soulless wall art.  Or not. Great images depend on the person holding the camera making that exposure.  It doesn’t matter if the camera is a one-time use Kodak with Tri-X film, a Leica MP, a Rolleiflex, a Canon A-1, Olympus XA, Nikon F4, a battered Pentax Spotmatic that you bought for $10, or a $2500 mirrorless outfit.  The photo is made between the ears.  Why is it that young people are wanting to shoot film?  It definitely isn’t perfect. Things don’t always come out the way that you thought they would.  It takes chemicals to process the film, and it’s expensive to send rolls to a lab.  Yet, they persist, because film has captured their imagination.  It’s okay to have serendipity, to have a mistake turn into a successful image.  Using a camera that is always ready because it has no batteries to charge, no start-up delay, and requires only that you, the person using it, has some creative impulse to satisfy.  Even a lowly one-time use camera can be used, within its limitations, to take interesting and meaningful images.  From an Agfa LeBox dispo camera.There is something about using a Nikon F with just its plain prism that I am sure the digital folks just won’t get.  That is, the ability to always choose exactly what I want to shoot at. There is no mini-computer telling me what the histogram should be, asking what digital effect would I like, whether or not the person is smiling in face detection, etc. Photography should not have to be about those things.  What do you feel?  What do you see?  How does the scene before you affect you?   How will you commit it to a piece of acetate with a coating of silver salts and dyes?  As we approach the end of 2021, and I look back on over two decades of committing myself to becoming a photographer, I see how I have changed in my approach and my expectations, and choice of subjects.  In the beginning, I wanted to be able to take really good macro shots of insects, because that was the realm within which I worked.  Along the way, I learned a lot by reading, and shooting hundreds of transparencies, because that’s what the nature pros did.  Slide film.  Just when I got pretty good at it, digital SLRs started to appear, and they became a tool that I used in my work, and made my museum work all the better because of the immediacy and how the images are used. Magicicada septendecim, May, 2004But that work world was different from the creative world that I embraced with film cameras.  In that world, lay the myriad paths one could take, depending on types of film, type of camera, format, type of lens, or not lens (pinhole), genre, type of darkroom process, etc.  In other words, film photography is a rich environment that never stops being capable of teaching us things. You don’t need to spend much to get into the club, and in the film world, everyone has a seat at the table.  From one-time use cameras to wet-plate, from pinhole to Leitz Summicrons, from Kodak Gold 100 to Ilford Ortho 80.    In short, the film world offers creative possibilities that will often lead one to paths that they never knew existed.Bill Schwab, 2008 and his wet platesSo, this season, buy a kid a Kodak, Lomo, or Harman simple-use camera and see what happens.  Be ready to have an old Pentax or Canon or Nikon to loan or give away once the thrill kicks in.(Note: Do not take this post as a rant against digital photography.  It's not.)"},
{"title": "Shooting the Bad Guys With a Ricoh", "date": "Wednesday, December 08, 2021", "text": "Back in October I was in Tucson, AZ, and my daughter suggested that we go to the local Antique Mall. That’s something that we always enjoyed doing together whenever we were on road trips, and part of the fun is that we never know what we’ll find that attracts our interest. Usually for me, it’s cameras, but pickings have been slim at any antique stores that I have visited in NC. An antique mall in Arizona should certainly have some different and unusual items, so off we went. Jorie found some animal skulls (that’s her thing), and pointed out Zuni fetishes and other local art that was there. A few aisles over, I saw what looked like a camera up on a high shelf. I took it down, and was immediately interested. It was an inexpensive 35mm camera with an electric stepper motor and armature connected to it. Also inscribed in multiple places was Tucson Police Department (TPD)! Hmm. I’ve never seen anything like that before, and the price was $35. I thought it might be on sale for 20% off, but it wasn’t in a display case. To compound the idea that I was going to purchase it, their credit card machine was down. So, I had them place the camera and a typewriter that I also wanted on the shelf behind the register and I’d return the next day to try again when their credit machine would be working. The next day, I went back and still no credit card operation, so I walked a block to an ATM and got cash. I got everything back to the vacation rental we were staying at, and took a better look at the camera and the gizmo it was attached to. I could see that the focus and manual control on the barrel of the Ricoh 35 ZF were taped so that they wouldn’t easily be changed, so my first thought is that the camera was used for something like mug shots or interview-room photos. I posted a photo of the contraption on Instagram and got some suggestions about what the camera might have been used for, and then I got a direct message from Kikie Wilkins, who knows a guy that was in the TPD.The outfit that I purchased - frontbacksideIt turns out that the camera was used in convenience stores and gas stations in Tucson under the Robbery Surveillance Program, which ran from the 1970s to 2008. The program installed these cameras into the majority of convenience stores throughout Tucson, and had an arrest rate of 80%! The Crime Scene Unit serviced the cameras. Once video surveillance became more common and affordable, these cameras were removed and sold off as surplusIn use, the camera was hidden behind a speaker grille and faced the counter where the transactions were made. In case of a robbery, the clerk would remove the \"bait money\" which allowed two contacts to touch in the cash drawer, sending a signal to the remote camera, activating the AC circuit, which powered the stepper motor, and the camera would generally shoot 22 frames of 35mm black and white film. The Crime Scene Unit officers would remove the film and replace it with fresh film. Back at the station, the film was developed and printed, and I assume that the images were good enough to capture the perps in a short time.Robbery Camera inside speaker casespeaker casefront of speaker grille pulled downview through the meshfinal image transmitter with bait moneytransmitter with bill removedWe are so used to CCTV cameras in stores, gas stations, banks, and on the street that we generally don’t give them a second thought. Compared to the camera shown here, they are remarkably compact, quiet, and can save the information on a tape or a hard drive, and perhaps relay to a station what’s going on in real time.  While it might seem somewhat archaic, the TPD system was successful, and unless the camera was activated, it required little maintenance.The camera is a Ricoh 35 ZF, a fairly inexpensive camera with auto and manual exposure control. The camera had no battery inside, so I am guessing that the TPD figured out the ambient lighting and adjust the camera to a setting that gave a good exposure, taping the barrel controls so that it would not get \"readjusted.\" The Ricoh 35 ZF is a competent little Zone Focus (hence the ZF?) camera with a 40mm f/2.8 lens, shutter speeds from B to 1/8- 1/500 sec, and focus from 3 feet to infinity. The ISO settings range from 25-800. The Ricoh ZF was manufactured in 1976 in Taiwan. It can be operated without the mercury cell in manual mode, or with power, be used in A mode as a shutter-priority camera. As I said above, the camera was used in Manual mode. I don’t know if other camera models were used in the Robbery Surveillance Program, but I would not be too surprised if there were. The stepper motor and actuator could have been customized for any similar-sized camera. I bought this unit out of curiosity, and I have high hopes for the Ricoh 35 ZF as a pocket-able camera to take along with my bigger SLRs, etc. The camera did have a roll of Kodak Ultra Max 400 color film inside, but after I developed it, the result was a blank roll.  I have since removed the camera, put in fresh foam seals, cleaned it up and have some film loaded.  I'll review the camera after I have used it in a separate post.After I returned home from our trip, I decided to plug the AC cord into some power, and lo and behold, the motor turned and it was fascinating to watch the process. The motor operates at 30 rpm, so the exposures are 2 seconds apart. With each revolution, the film advance lever was moved forward and a small projection on the upper arm depressed the shutter button. The process continued as long as I had power to it, so I do wonder of the controller had some sort of timing switch that turned off the device after 40 seconds or so, which would have been at least 20 exposures.From the photographs from the TPD display, the camera was set at 1/60 sec and f/2.8. I am guessing that the distance was the 15 ft. mark.  It does make some noise, so you know something's going on, though I suspect in the heat of the moment, it probably doesn't register that it's clicking away.I thank Kikie Wilkins in Tucson for his fantastic help and getting images from the Crime Scene Unit display to me. I like this bit of information: \"The crime scene unit has a small display case with their old cameras and other doodads and one of them had one of these cameras in there with the speaker box and a photo they developed of a robber pointing his gun at the speaker box, shortly before he shot the camera. The film was still able to be retrieved and developed.\"Now THAT's getting the shot!FPP's LOW ISO Color negative filmIf you have been reading Random Camera Blog for any length of time, you have undoubtedly seen some of my posts on slow b&w films, or maybe you read Issue 1 of Monochrome Mania on low-iso film.  Part of the fun with these films is that many were not made for your everyday still-camera shooting.  Some of them have uses in the cine industry that are definitely not what we are using them for.  So it is with the Film Photography Project's COLOR Low-ISO negative film.  Designed to be a color digital intermediate film (whatever that means), it has an ISO of 1.6, which I'll round out to ISO 2, because that's what I shot it at.This is an ECN-2 film on an Estar base, but does not have a remjet layer, so it can be developed in ECN-2 without using an alkaline pre-bath to remove remjet.  It can also be developed in C-41, which is what I did, as it was sent out to The Darkroom lab to be developed while I was on the road out west in October. It is a Kodak Vision 3 film, and is still in production.  I'm sure that the low ISO rating would put most people off from trying it, but as I said, I like playing with super slow films that were not necessarily designed for still photography.I shot a roll of this in Arizona, with some shots done on a tripod, late in the day at Saguaro National Park East.  The rest of the roll was shot in downtown Tucson while walking around on 4th Avenue.  I know how I have said that these films are best on a tripod, so it was a challenge shooting handheld.  You can do the math - if I were using sunny 16, it would be 1/2 sec at f/16 in full sun.  To shoot it handheld, I should strive for 1/15 to 1/30 sec. That's f/4 at 1/30 sec - completely doable. (1/2 sec to 1/30 sec is a change of 4 stops, so. f/11, f/8, f/5.6, f/4. - see, you don't even need a meter. Sure, if you want to shoot at f/11 or even f/8. you'll need a tripod.  My shots in the desert late in the day were at f/8 at about 1/2 sec.   I used my Nikon FM2N, because it's completely manual, and I just set the aperture and shutter speed where they should have been, because, the ISO only goes to 12, so metering is out.When I got my film back and then scanned it, I was amazed at the colors. It definitely has an Ektar kind of look, and overall, I was pleased with what I got.  Sure, it's slow and colorful, so what's not to like? I do wish the FPP would offer these films in 36 exposure rolls, though.  Since it is rem-jet free, you can take it to any lab or do it yourself.  Here are some examples from Arizona. The first set is from Saguaro National Park East.And now, from the streets of Tucson the next day!I really like the look that I got with this film, and I would definitely shoot it again.  If you are looking for some different color emulsions to work with, give it a try!"},
{"title": "FPP Frankenstein 200 Film!", "date": "Saturday, November 27, 2021", "text": "For the past several years, the Film Photography Project Store has been introducing a monster-themed black and white film.  One of the reasons is that people love films with great packaging, and it certainly helps if the film itself can give good results.  Their line of \"Monster Films\" are hand-picked by Mike Raso to give consumers a taste of different films they might otherwise not consider.  The Dracula 64 is one of my favorite films with good contrast and fine grain.  Last year, the FPP introduced Wolfman 100 in both 35mm and 120, and this year, 2021, they came out with Frankenstein 200 in 35mm,  120, 620,AND 4x5. A big surprise was the release of Dracula 64 in 120, which I am quite excited about.I'm not going to go and tell you what these films actually are -- that sort of spoils the fun - but if you are familiar with their line of film stocks, you can probably figure it out.  Besides, isn't it great when someone asks what you are shooting with and you can say \"Frankenstein 200?\"Due to the wonderfully rendered monsters on each film label, I think that these films sell quite well, and the results from them are scary good. You don't have to save them for Halloween - any time of the year is good.  So, let's take a look at the latest Frankenstein 200.   Frankenstein 200 is a medium speed panchromatic film that conveniently fills the gap between ISO 100 and 400.  In the color world, ISO 200 is a common ISO, but not so much in the monochrome world.  In older cameras that may not have 1/500 sec shutter speeds (and in the Hexar AF, a not so vintage camera, 1/250 sec is the max), Frankenstein 200 gives you a nice option.  It's a medium-grain film that has a traditional look to it, and it does well with the common D-76 developer.  Since it's also available in 120 and 4x5, that gives the larger format users something that's reasonably priced at ISO 200. Developer-wise you have a few options:Kodak D76 - Stock Solution / 20°C/ 5-6 minKodak D76 - 1+1 / 20°C/ 8-9 minFPP D96 - Stock solution / 20°C/ 7 minKodak HC-110 - Dilution B / 20°C/ 4 minutes or Dilution H (1+63) for 9 minKodak X-Tol - Stock solution /20°C/ 6 minI shot two rolls - one with my Leica M2, and one in my Nikon FE2.  Each roll was shot on separate trips, and I thought my results were very good.  Both were developed in D-76 1:1 for 8.5 min.grain elevator, Tucumcari, NMLeica M2 with 35 f/1.4 SummiluxCuervo, NM ghost townLeica M2 with 35 f/1.4 SummiluxCuervo, NM ghost townLeica M2 with 35 f/1.4 SummiluxVirginia Rest area, Nikon FE2Glen Jean Bank, WV, Nikon FE2Kent Square, Pittsburgh, PA, Nikon FE2I really like this film, and you should give it a try.I don't know what's in the works for next year, but I hope that Mummy 400 is under wraps until then."},
{"title": "Olympus 35 DC - Auto Exposure Delight", "date": "Friday, November 12, 2021", "text": "Over the years, I have used/tested a lot of small 35mm Olympus cameras.  The Olympus 35 RC remains one of the favorites, precisely because of its size and manual control.  However, with automation, comes pitfalls - lack of precise control might turn you off.  Can you trust the camera to take a proper exposure all the time?  Enter the Olympus 35 DC.  I wonder if DC refers to \"Distance Control\" since it is a proper rangefinder camera, and beyond that, the camera does the rest. The 35 DC is the automated sibling of the 35 RD, a camera that commands pretty good prices.  You can find the manual online at the usual place - Mike Butkis.  However, the manual there refers to the later version of the 35 DC. My version is earlier, so the manual for it is located here.Olympus 35 DCFirst of all, the Olympus 35 DC features a wonderful 40mm f/1.7, and good luck finding a rangefinder camera of that size with such a lens (that would be the 35 RD).   The ISO settings range from 25-800, giving you some real choices for film types.  The shutter speed and aperture combination are shown in the viewfinder, so you do at least know what settings the camera is using for a scene, and there is a backlight compensation button at the rear of the camera for backlit scenes to add 1.5 stops of exposure.  The self-timer is located on the front, and there is a top-deck mounted dial for entering the flash Guide Number if you are using a flash.  The exposures range from 1/15 sec at f/1.7 to 1500 sec at f/16.  There is no B setting.This is the earlier version - no battery check button nearthe rear eyepiece.also note the button on the far left - it releases the shutter lock while loading film in a dark area or with the lenscap on.The 35 DC focuses from less than a meter, and the RF patch is quite visible and eassy to focus.   I have to say that this little camera feels good in the hands and is really easy to use.   Just focus, and press the shutter.  That makes it an ideal street camera, as the 40mm lens is a bit wider than 50, and it's very quiet.Adjusting the ISO is accomplished by turning the black plastic ring on the barell - right next to the chrome ring.  You can only do this by setting the lens at its closest focus, so that you can grasp the black ring and rotate it.  The CdS photocell is located in the bezel around the lens, so you can use filters. The great news is that the 35 DC uses 49mm filters, which are not some oddball size.Battery - I used a PX625A, which is 1.5 V.  The camera originally used the Mercury PX-625 1.3V cells.  You may need to ajust the ISO setting for the film to get an accurate exposure, or you can find a 1.3V zinc-air hearing aid battery to fit into the battery chamber.I shot a couple of rolls with this camera, and my exposures came out fine.  You can see for yourself in the images below.  I can certainly recommend the Olympus 35DC as a great carry-around everywhere 35mm camera. The sturdy metal body will definitely make you appreciate the quality that went into making this camera.Kodak Gold 200Kodak Gold 200Kodak Gold 200Kodak Gold 200Kodak Gold 200Ilford Pan-F at ISO 32Ilford Pan-F at ISO 32"},
{"title": "Saguaros and the Catalina Mountains ", "date": "Wednesday, November 10, 2021", "text": "Saguaros and the Catalinas, Holga 120NOne of the things about my trip to the Sonoran Desert is that we stayed in Tucson for a week, and our rental cottage was less than 2 miles from Saguaro National Park East (SNPE).  We were also fairly close to the Sabino Canyon Recreation Area - as well as the road that takes you to Mt. Lemmon.  What a fantastic location to be staying at for that length of time.  When I was packing for this trip, I almost didn't bring a Holga.  Then I thought about it some more and decided that I'd find a filter ring and use a yellow filter for the b&w shots.  For most of the trip, we had clear skies with nary a hint of clouds, but our final day there, we had beautiful cirrus clouds that added so much to the stark landscape.  Typically, a cloudless sky has very little drama - a gray featureless backdrop to landscapes or buildings.  In color, you have those azure skies that go on forever, but even then, some clouds add something.  The day I took this was our last day in Tucson, October 16.  We drove out to Sabino Canyon Recreation Area and hiked a section of the trail that goes through some of the most beautiful Saguaro cactus \"groves\" that I have seen.  On top of that, the Catalina Mountains add a great background.  The day before, we had driven up the Mt. Lemmon Highway, and viewed some wonderful landscapes, as well as looked back and saw the entirety of the bowl that Tucson lies in - ringed by mountains in all directions.  I think this shot of the Saguaros from the Sabino Canyon Rec. Area was the best one taken with my Holga 120N.  I used Arista 400 film and a yellow filter held in place with a Series VI adapter ring.  It was also the last roll of film that I scanned from this trip - 36 rolls, mostly 35mm.  Saguaro friends, SNPE, 10/10, Holga 120N, Fomapan 400, yellow filter.The image above was also taken with the Holga on our first full day in Tucson on Oct. 10.  The  SNPE is full of opportunities to explore these cactus forests at your own leisure.

{"title": " KONO! Delight Art Film Review", "date": "Wednesday, November 03, 2021", "text": "Kono! Delight Art Film in 120 (from Kono)KONO Manufaktur is a Germany-based company that reimagines current film stocks - or \"upgrades\" them according to their literature.  Typically, they have sold various 35mm color emulsions that are tinted in some way by pre-flashing them to create different color streaks and wash effects.  They call this \"reanimated film\".  The various 35mm color emulsions are certainly attractive for people wanting to try something a bit more esoteric. Each of the brands - Monsoon, Moonstruck, Sunstroke, Galaxy, Mirage, and Candy evoke different moods with the color palettes and effects that Kono has implemented with their \"reanimation.\"  However, the Delight Art film is something a bit different, and is sold in 35mm and 120 rolls.Earlier this year, I was given a roll of the Kono! Delight Art film in 120, and I finally had the chance to use it somewhere special when I was visiting Tucson, Arizona in October.  I really didn't know what to expect, but upon opening the package I could see that it was Kodak Ektar 100 with a Kono sticker on it.  I loaded my Yashicamat 124 with the roll and shot it.  I sent it to The Darkroom to be developed, and a within a week, I had my film back.  After scanning the negatives on my Epson V700 scanner, I was able to really see how the film differed from standard Ektar 100.  The images look like a warming filter was placed over the lens, as the effect tamed the bluish tendencies of Ektar 100, and colors were more yellow and warmer.  That's not a bad thing, given where and what I was shooting. However, given that the cost of a roll of the Kono Delight Art film in 120 is $25.00 and the cost of a roll of Ektar 100 is 9.70 (in a 5-roll pack), I think that if you just attach an 81A warming filter over the lens, or an 85B for a more pronounced effect, you'll get similar results and save yourself some money.The altered colors of the Kono films are not for everyone and every situation.  Some people like the effects and others see them as gimmicky.  They do offer something different to try out, and go for it if you are so inclined.  However, the Delight Art film is priced such that you may as well experiment with color filters on regular Ektar (or any other color film) and se where that takes you.Here are a few images from the roll that I shot in Tucson.  The effect was a good choice for the scenes there.There's a lot of stucco/adobe in the SW, and you can finda pleasing composition in just a doorway.I love the way this cactus becomes the focal pointThe yellow tint is more obvious with a white objectIn plain Ektar, this sky would be really blue.definitely warm"},

His approach to the subjects is a fun read, and I found myself in agreement with pretty much all that he said.   I do think he focused on “glam” cameras such as the Contax series -- overpriced electronic point and shoots that would quickly blow a beginner’s budget, and might also die an electronic death.  Instead, I’d suggest a Minolta Hi-Matic AF2, Olympus Infinity, or a Nikon One-Touch 35 AF.   Likewise, While I agree that the Nikon F and F2 are great SLRs -- I’d recommend a Nikon FM2N over either one as a great SLR for someone coming to film.  Each section is also accompanied by a photo on the opposing page, which adds to the reader’s enrichment, and serves to accentuate each instructional page.  Many, but not all, were taken by the author.My only real criticism is on Item 33 - Sunny 16.  It provides a table of three film ISOs, 100, 200, and 400, and as shown is entirely wrong.  The shutter speed stays the same for a given ISO - yet this table would have you vastly underexposing your images were you to follow it.  I don’t know if it was just something missed in editing, but it’s flat-out wrong. Wong is wrong on this one.Something very wrong with this Sunny-16 table.Kai repeatedly makes the case about not getting caught up in a never-ending upgrade process, and that’s a fair point.  Get to use a camera well, and then you'll find out out what if any, limitations it has. My view is always that the most important component is the person holding the camera, not the camera itself.   He sticks to what the average new enthusiast might want to explore, so 35 mm gets a major part of the discussion, and I agree with that.  The three lenses in your bag is a good philosophy, and while I don’t always practice it myself, I agree with it.   The creative process is not ignored, either, and Kai covers it well, within the confines of the book’s format. Overall, Kai Wong has put together an easily digestible manual for beginning photographers wanting to explore using film.  The resources in the back with web links, etc, are also a great addition.This book would make a good gift for the aspiring film user, but you might want to include a proper sunny-16 chart or the Black Cat Exposure Guide along with the book."},
{"title": " Fifteen Days On The Road - Part 1", "date": "Sunday, October 24, 2021", "text": "b&w film to developcolor film to scanLots of film to process, lots of film to scan!  I shot 35 rolls on this trip, and used every camera that I brought.  I decided to send out the C-41 and E-6 rolls to The Darkroom for processing while I was on the trip, which meant that some arrived home before I returned.  I am just getting started on scanning those.A few days ago, I returned from my first lengthy road trip since COVID-19 took over.  The ultimate goal was spending a week in Tucson, AZ, and visiting our daughter.  I planned the westward trip trip pretty well, allowing plenty of time for me to finally visit some places along Route 66.  This was our first trip West starting from western North Carolina, so naturally, Route 40 was the main Interstate that we drove.  We elected to drive my wife's Toyota Corolla Hybrid, since it's been proven to be comfortable for long trips, and at worst, it gets over 50 mpg.  We left October 5, and our first night was in Forrest City, AR, not too far past Memphis, TN.  Our mileage for the day was 557 miles, with just rest stops along along the way.  Forrest City was named for Nathan Bedford Forrest, who used the location as a campsite for a construction crew completing a railroad between Memphis and Little Rock, shortly after the Civil War.  As we know, Forrest was a Confederate Army general, who said \"If we ain't fightin' to keep slavery, then what the hell are we fightin' for?\"  Leaving little doubt about his feelings, he was the Grand Wizard of the KKK after the Civil war.  While Forrest City is just a spot on the map,  I think about the history of places that we visit, and the reasons for place names being what they are.  We made good time on Day 2, traveling 512 miles, to spend the night in Clinton, Oklahoma, which is right on the old Route 66.    Once I-40 hits Oklahoma City, it joins/replaces the old Route 66.  Clinton was formed in 1902, and was originally called Washita Junction (railroads play a big part in its formation), but the U.S. Post Office would not accept Washita Junction as a name, so it was changed to Clinton, the first name of Judge Clinton Irwin.  Unlike many places along Route 66, Clinton is a thriving community, and is the largest city along Route 66 between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, TX.  We stayed at a La Quinta motel which was really nice, and it even had a bar.    I took some time to see some of the Route 66 business area, and found the Glancy Motor Hotel, which was in sad shape.  The Oklahoma Route 66 Museum is located in Clinton, but as we got there late in the day it was not open.   Nonetheless, I got some pretty good shots of the places we visited.  Day 3 was the fewest miles traveled, because it involved a lot of stops along Rt. 66, but it also covered three states, as we left Oklahoma to pass through the Texas Panhandle (the absolute shortest path across Texas) and enter New Mexico, where we planned to stay the night in Tucumcari, NM.  I had originally planned to spend the night in Erick, OK, and am glad we stayed in Clinton.  Erick marks the 100th Meridian, which essentially marks anything beyond as \"the West.\"  There is a 100th Meridian Museum in Erick, and it was closed.  It's probably more famous as being the hometown of singer/songwriter/performer Roger Miller. \"King of the Road\" was in my head was too often.  There is a terrific mural featuring him on what may have been the Roger Miller Museum, which closed long ago. The mural is in excellent shape, but I can't say that for the rest of Erick.  A casualty of Interstate  40, and the ceaseless loss of residents to more urban areas, Erick has certainly seen better days.  Those people staying there now are hardy folks.We traveled for a bit on the old Rt. 66 which at times is an I-40 business route and at others, a parallel service road that is barely maintained. It was great to be on the two-lane, grasshoppers smashing into our grille, the grasses whizzing by.  Our first stop in Texas was in Shamrock, a town that has wholeheartedly embraced the Route 66 theme.  I primarily wanted to see the famous Conoco gas station, and was not disappointed.  The U-Drop Inn and gas station is an Art Deco wonder, and was saved from ruin and disrepair by he First National Bank of Shamrock, which gave it to the city. After a $1.7 million federal grant, they restored the building to its original condition and adapted it into a museum, visitors' center, gift shop, and the city's chamber of commerce.  We enjoyed a very tasty chocolate milkshake there.  We hit the Texas Visitor's Center and rest area that's on I-40 east of Amarillo, and it was definitely photo-worthy.  After that, we drove past Amarillo (Had we chosen to stop there, it might have been another day before we left!) and across the rest of the panhandle.  I was amazed to see the hundreds of wind turbines there.  It's obvious that not all the money in Texas is being made on petroleum-based energy.  Also struck by the huge expanses of cotton and sorghum fields.  We stopped briefly in Adrian, TX, which marks the mid-point of Route 66.   The most impressive thing I photographed there was the grain elevator.Adrian, TXTexas PanhandleWe made it to Tucumcari, NM with plenty of daylight left, and found a lovely room at the Roadrunner Lodge Motel, an original Route 66 motel that's been lovingly restored/maintained by its current owners.    Tucumcari is one of those Route 66 destinations that you really have to visit.  There's a lot of period architectural and neon eye-candy to keep one occupied.  While I-40 bypasses it, Tucumcari is big enough and charming to make you want to explore it a lot further.  I'll end this travelogue here, as New Mexico is an adventure by itself.Clinton, OK"},
{"title": "DOOMO D light meter review", "date": "Wednesday, September 29, 2021", "text": "The DOOMO D meter matches the lines and finish of a Leica M2Lately, we have all seen a number of extremely-compact shoe-mountable light meters such as the one from Raveni Labs, and the KEKS EM01.  These little wonders use a small OLED screen to provide the exposure information, with tiny buttons to change settings, etc.  My biggest problem with these ultra-tiny meters is that the screens are sometimes difficult to read, and that they are small enough to well,... lose.  I have been using handheld meters such as the Gossen Pilot Selenium meters (which work quite well) and the Sekonic L-208 Twin-Mate, a modern, still-in-production light meter.  I originally wanted a Voigtlander VC Speed Meter II, but with a price at over $200, it was more than I wanted to pay.DOOMO D meterNow, I think I have found a favorite light meter for my Leica M2. It's the DOOMO Meter D, which at first glance looks a lot like the Voigtlander VC II.  First of all, it has exactly the layout I wanted - an analog dial approach, just as you would find on a camera, with +/- red LEDs and a green one for the \"correct\" exposure.  It sits in the accessory shoe on the Leica perfectly, and looks like it's part of the camera.  The dials are easy to move, and the LEDS are easy to see in bright light.  On top of that, it has a metal case that looks robust and well-finished, and a perfect match for any classic camera.  However, looks are not everything. It also has to work well, be easy to use, and I need to have confidence in its accuracy.  The DOOMO D meter does all those things. Upon receipt of the DOOMO D meter  from Cameractive (direct from China), I was pleased to see it well-packaged in a black box.  Now, I am a pretty experienced photographer and familiar with all sorts of gadgets. The only information in the box is a small card that has brief instructions on inserting a battery (CR-1632 coin cell that is not included) and QR codes to take you to the online manual. I had no trouble figuring the rest out without looking online. The package also includes two shoe mounts, screws, a small black stick-on circle, and a small screwdriver.  My only quibble is that while the slotted head screwdriver fits the Phillips-head screws, it should be replaced by an actual Phillips head screwdriver.  However, if you need to use the manual, the online manual has all you need. If you have used a camera with built-in light meter such as a Nikon FM, then the controls don't need much explanation.  You set your film's ISO on the left wheel, - which ranges from 25-6400, and that wheel also has your aperture settings (f/1- f/22), while the right wheel has the shutter speeds (1 sec - 1/2000).  If like me, you are an aperture priority person, I set my aperture and move the shutter speed dial until it the LED shows green, or +/- 1 stop, and then I set my shutter speed on the camera to match.  Now the funny thing is -- it's entirely possible to forget that you have to adjust the camera settings to match what the DOOMO light meter is at.  I had a brain fart like that a couple of times, forgetting to transfer the meter settings to the camera. That's not a meter problem, it's a human problem!You can attach the shoe connector to either the right side or the center, and the screws hold it firmly in place to the body of the meter. For my Leica M2, the meter needs to hang to the left of the shoe, and the placement is absolutely perfect.  online manualResults. After shooting three rolls of film with the DOOMO D light meter, I feel very confident in its metering accuracy.  It's made me use my M2 more often, and at only a hair over 2 ounces in weight, it's not even noticeable as an add-on.  The metering is easy - press the black button on the rear to activate the meter, and adjust accordingly for your exposure.  The meter has a 30° angle of view for the sensing, and that seems to work quite well.  The advertised battery life is 60 hours of continuous use, and that's a lot of shooting.  I recommend having a spare, just in case. You can get a package of 10 CR-1632 3V cells on Amazon for less than $6. That's the price of one at the hardware store.underside of meter. The battery compartment issecurely closed with a screw.Overall, I found the DOOMO D light meter to be just what I wanted - simple, accurate, stylish, and well-made.  For me, it's a perfect fit for my Leica, and I highly recommend it if you want an analog-style meter.   It's available directly from Cameractive as well as Doomo and some eBay sellers.  Also, take a look at the Doomo Instagram account, as well.  At a price of $125, I think it's very affordable and probably the least expensive accessory for your Leica that you will ever find. I thank Zhang at Cameractive for contacting me and sending the meter to review.  rear view of the DOOMO D meterSome images from the M2 with Ultrafine Extreme 400 film, using the DOOMO D meterMore images from my October 2021 trip to the Southwest US.  The Leica and DOOMO D meter make a great pair.Tucumcari, NM, FPP Frankenstein 200 filmCuervo, NM, FPP Frankenstein 200 film  Cuervo, NM, FPP Frankenstein 200 filmLordsburg, NM, Fomapan 100Gila National Forest, NM, Fomapan 100Gates Pass Rd., Tucson, AZ,  Fomapan 100"},
{"title": " I AM SPARTUS!  ", "date": "Sunday, September 19, 2021", "text": "The Spartus 35 and 35F  cameras were sold from 1947-1954, and were manufactured by Spartus and then the Herold Manufacturing Co. in Chicago.  Although they are basic 35mm cameras, there are several iterations under the name, some with more than 1 shutter speed. All have several apertures.  While they somewhat resemble an Argus A, they are nowhere near the precision of that camera.  Lenses are inconsistent in results, and the cheap construction, rough finish, and lack of accurate control make them definite candidates for the Low-Fi camera selection.  Produced in the post-war photography boom, the Spartus 35 sold for about $12.00 - $29.00 depending on the model and the year.  The latter version of the 35 has a more streamlined styling, but no real change in features.   Spartus 35 F and the Spartus 35 front viewsSpartus 35 F and the Spartus 35 back views. Note the differences between the twointerior of Spartus 35FWhile researching the Spartus cameras, I believe I found an error in Glass, Brass, & Chrome by Lahue and Bailey (2002 reprint by Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 347 pp.).  The authors claimed that the Falcon cameras – cheaply built 127 snapshot cameras that resemble a 35mm camera, had one model that was 35mm.  I have looked in every catalog and on-line source, and there is no evidence of a 35mm Falcon.  However, the interesting thing is that the Falcon models were originally made by the Utility Mfg. Co. in New York, until 1941, when the Spartus Corp. bought the company and moved its operations to Chicago.  This is where things get a little fuzzy, as Spartus then became the company name, producing a dizzying array of cheap 127, 120 and 620 cameras under various names, as well as clocks and razors.  In 1951, Harold Rubin bought the company, and renamed it Herold Mfg. Co., still at the same address on Lake Street in Chicago. So, in the end, it is certainly possible that some part of the Falcon 127 body molds may have been modified to make the Spartus 35, but there was no Falcon 35mm.  Also noteworthy – on the face of my Spartus 35 it reads NOT INC. under HEROLD MFG. CO., meaning that it wasn’t incorporated.  The Spartus 35 was the only 35mm camera produced by the Spartus and Herold companies.I picked up a Spartus 35F on eBay just a little over a week ago, and paid $15 plus shipping.  I was amazed that the leather case with it looked practically new.  That’s a lot of years  - close to 70, without much use. I had to add a bit of oil to gt the shutter to function as it should, and as there are only two shutter settings – Time and Instant, not much to worry about.  There are four aperture settings – f/6.3, 8, 11, and 16.  The body is Bakelite, with aluminum and brass parts. The back opens by releasing a spring catch on the left side. The film loads on the right side, with the takeup spool on the left.  An aluminum button on the back is pushed in every time you wish to advance the film, which releases a cam that does one rotation as the film advances. You must manually reset the frame counter to 0 before loading the film.  There are a few differences, other than the styling between the black plastic Spartus 35 and the last iteration – Spartus “35” with a gray plastic top deck and brown body.  The last version has the film cassette on the left side, and the takeup spool on the right.  The flash contacts are moved to the right side, and the frame counter to the left.  A push button on the right side opens the back, which is fully removable, and the button to allow the film to advance is on the lower right side of the back.  The tripod socket has moved to the center, rather than the left as part of the takeup spool assembly. Also, instead of using actual f/stop numbers on the front rotating selector, it has dull, cloudy, hazy, and bright. Overall, a fairly simple camera to operate. While the lens rotates to focus from 4 feet to infinity, it’s pretty much guesswork. Since I was shooting mostly at f/11, with a roll of Ilford Pan-F, most subjects were over 50 feet away.  Closer shots ranged from 10 feet to 40 feet, so really, at f/11 or f/16, I don’t think the focus is as critical.  The viewfinder is just an approximation of what will be in the frame.  I took the Spartus “35 F” on a walk through the River Arts District in Asheville, which is my usual place to shoot and test new cameras.  It was a hazy sunny day, so f/11 it was, and I shot the roll of Pan-F pretty quickly as I walked through the area.   I developed the film in Rodinal 1:25 for 6 minutes, and when the film was hung to dry, I was amazed at the quality of the images.  My work on the shutter had paid off, as every frame was exposed pretty well.  I purposefully did one multi-exposure frame as 3 shots at f/16, and not too bad.  The frame spacing is pretty tight, and the actual frame size is 24x37.5 mm.  There was a small crescent shadow in the lower right corner of the frame (actually upper left in the camera), which turned out to be from a wire connecting the flash contacts to the shutter.  I pushed it upward away from the film gate, so future shots should be fine.  Here are a few images from the 36 exposure roll of Pan-F. triple-exposureI am pretty impressed with the quality of the photos, and a low-speed ISO film such as Ilford Pan-F is perfect for this camera.If you want to read more about the Utility/Spartus/Herold history, here are some links to follow:Mike Eckman’s great article Made In Chicago Camera-Wiki"},
{"title": " LOMO SLOOOOW B&W Films", "date": "Sunday, September 12, 2021", "text": "Lomography continues to surprise us with its array of films, and the two b&w cine films in its latest offering - Babylon 13 and Fantôme 8 certainly will appeal to a smaller group of photographers.  Before I discuss these two \"new\" films, I should add that they fall within Lomography's Kino subset of films - purported to give cinematic effects to your images.  These four b&w films - Berlin, Potsdam, Fantôme, and Babylon are rebranded Orwo cine film stocks.  I previously reviewed Berlin and Potsdam in 2020.  The Lomo Kino family (from Lomography)I give credit to whoever writes the ad copy for Lomography:From the Babylon Kino page -- \"Delicately capture the details of life’s most emotive moments with this moony-eyed monochrome.\" and the Fantôme Kino -- \"Effortlessly evoke the theatre in your everyday life with this show-stopping black and white beauty.\"So if that doesn't pull you in, there's more:Fantôme Kino-\"This panchromatic is perfect for seasoned professionals and creative first time photographers alike. Particularly appropriate for those who like to take full manual control and experiment with flash photography, the Fantôme Kino B&W Film packs drama into the frame with crushed shadows and super high contrast renderings, reminiscent of our favourite Film Noir classics.\"The key takeaway here should be that these are low-ISO films and at ISO 8 (Fantôme) and 13 (Babylon), they are not going to be used in your crappy plastic Lomo cameras. You'll need an SLR or a decent rangefinder camera that can meter to and ISO of at least 12, preferably 6.  Or, use a handheld meter or phone app that can meter at low ISOs.   Since they are so slow, a tripod will greatly assist in making the longer exposures.  The other factor to consider, is that both of these stocks were created for cinematic uses, not for conventional still photography.  Just as I wrote about Kodak's cine films on the Film Photography Project Blog, some b&w  cine films are used for effects, titling, and making direct copies from the negatives.  The specialized films have narrower exposure latitude, may be orthochromatic, and will almost certainly have a low speed.  The great thing is that Lomography decided to offer them as something that may get your creative juices flowing, and allow you to experiment with some film stocks that you might never see otherwise.  After all, ORWO isn't the most expressive film company, and they cater to professional cinematographers, not a bunch of amateur shutterbugs. So having Lomography do the hype and selling of these films is a sure way to have people try them.I purchased these films from B&H  and of course, they arrived very quickly.  I bought two rolls of each, and shot a roll of each a few months ago.  Lomo Kino Fantôme 8If you can set your camera  ISO to 8, that's great. If it only goes to 12, you can dial in +2/3 of a stop for the extra exposure that is needed.  I loaded my Nikon F100 with the Fantôme, and shot the entire roll along the French Broad River at Ledges Whitewater Park.  It was getting close to sunset, and my exposures were between 8 and 12 seconds. I was using a 28mm Nikkor at f/16.  I felt that the long exposures would be interesting with the moving water and shadows on the water. Tripod, of course.I developed the film in FPP's D-96 for 6.5 minutes at 20°C.  The film base is clear, and curls like crazy when dry.  It wasn't much of a problem to scan though, as the curl is lengthwise, and not cupping the negatives.  The scans did not need much tweaking, and I really loved the results - moody, sharp as a tack, and I think it's one of those films that have a special use - and it works perfectly for what I was shooting.Lomo Babylon 13I loaded my Nikon F4 with the roll of Babylon, and set the ISO to 12.  I also used the 28mm Nikkor with a yellow K12 filter and polarizer to get dramatic skies that I knew were coming in that day.  The clouds were coming towards the Blue Ridge Parkway, and it didn't take me too long to shoot  the 36 exposure roll.  I also used a tripod.    I developed the film in HC-110B for 8.5 minutes at 20°C.  The film base isn't absolutely clear like the Fantôme. I had some odd vertical stripes show up on some frames, and I don't know the exact cause, though they look like a light leak .    The skies were appropriately dramatic, though the film's shadow detail could be better. I may have to shoot the next roll on a cloudy day and a different subject and see what I get.Of the two films, I liked the results from the Fantôme better, but both could use more testing, as a single roll doesn't tell me much, except what I got under quite different circumstances.   One thing that I am not a fan of is the plastic film cassette that Lomo has been using for these films.  I usually pop open the metal cassettes, but with the plastic two-piece cassettes, I end up having to use a leader retriever and then pull the film out of the cassette.  So long as you know this ahead of time, it's not so bad.  Are these films for you?  If you like experimenting with low-ISO films, I recommend them.   They are not snapshot films in any sense.  Home-developing is almost a must.   The only other way to try these films would be to buy a 200 ft reel from Orwo, which for most of us, is not going to happen.  At about $9 for a 36-exposure roll, they are not that expensive, and many places are selling the films.   If it's your first foray into slow films, be patient and use a tripod!"},
{"title": "Keep using those M42-mount lenses on newer non-M42 bodies", "date": "Friday, September 03, 2021", "text": "As I have written here often about M-42 mount lenses and cameras, you know how I love those Pentax Takumars.  There are many thousands of them in circulation, and most of them are still in good working order. The same can't always be said for M-42 mount bodies.  Meters die, shutters get old and cranky, and just because of age and abuse, those lovely (and some not so lovely) M-42 mount bodies can become unreliable.  Some are really heavy, too, which negates the benefit of those Takumars. When Pentax released their K-mount bodies, they also sold M-42 to K-mount adapters. Everything was the same as far as flange distance, so you could still keep using your screw-mount lenses on the Pentax K bodies.  However, that only allowed you to use the lens in manual stop-down mode for metering -- which you were probably already doing with a Spotmatic. So that's not a big drawback to their use.Fast forward to today, and the best replacement would be to use one of the Vivitar V3800N K-mount bodies, which are relatively recent, as SLR bodies go.  Those bodies also appeared as other brands, such as the Promaster 2500 PK Super.  You get a lightweight body, red/green diodes for the metering, a top shutter speed of 1/2000 sec, multiple exposure capability, self-timer, a PC and shoe flash ability, and depth of field preview - because you are shooting in stop-down mode.  The M-42 adapter in placeBe sure to move the aperture switch to ManualLook at that beauty.Another option is to use a Minolta Maxxum 7000 - which are plentiful and cheap.  You can find a Sony Alpha to M-42 mount adapter, and shoot in Aperture Priority or Manual modes.  Just like that, you have an M-42 mount camera with auto film advance!  Other Minolta AF bodies may also work well with the M-42 adapter, but I have not tested them.  Again, you'll need to use the lenses in Manual, not Auto mode, so they might be a bit dim for focusing in low light conditions.There are other M-42 mount adapters for other bodies, such as Nikon, but they don't focus to infinity. Sticking with a K-mount body and M-42 adapter is the logical choice, especially if you already have a camera such as the Pentax ME.  However, the Vivitar 3800N remains a very good and inexpensive option to continue using the wonderful range of screw-mount lenses. on a small, lightweight body with modern electronics.Of course, there are mounts for the latest mirrorless digital cameras, but we are talking only about using film cameras here.  The M-42 Pentax Takumar lenses are compact. I have a kit with a 50mm f/1.4, 24mm f/3.5, 105mm f/2.8, and a 17mm f/4 along with a Spotmatic F, filters, etc. and it occupies about 2/3 space  and weight that a Nikon kit has with similar lenses.  So, give those old Takumars a new life with a newer body, and adapter.  You'll quickly realize how nice those old lenses are."},
{"title": " Olympus 35 ECR- One Roll Review", "date": "Wednesday, September 01, 2021", "text": "Just when I think I have seen most of the small Olympus 35 series cameras, I run into one that's new to me.  I recently came across an Olympus 35 ECR, which is a pretty small rangefinder camera. Not zone-focus, like an Olympus Trip, but a real RF camera, but with absolutely no manual exposure control.  Apparently, this is a rangefinder version of the Olympus 35EC, which was a zone-focus camera with similar features.  The 35 ECR was introduced in 1972, and is a very compact camera for its time.  Olympus was no stranger to producing compact 35mm cameras, especially since they dominated the half-frame market with their series of PEN cameras.  You can download a manual from the Butkus site.The front of the  35 ECR The first thing that I noticed about this camera was its compact size of 11cm x 7cm x 5cm.  Being all-metal, it weighs 430 grams without a roll of film. Pretty heavy for such a small camera. Like most cameras in its class, it has a 42mm f/2.8 lens - neither really wide nor really fast, but actually, perfect for a camera of this sort.  ASA settings are 25-800 (not bad), and the CdS light sensor is located within the front of the lens barrel, so if you use a filter, it will automatically compensate. The downside of this camera is that it originally required two 1.4V RM-640 mercury cells to operate.  I used two 1.5V A 640 Alkaline cells, so the exposure might be a bit off. I have to say, that the battery compartment is pretty robust, taking up a significant portion of the bottom plate of the camera. The rewind lever is also located on the bottom, and the tripod socket on the L side, making for a busy bottom plate, while the top plate is very minimalist. The film advance is a thumbwheel on the back.The bottom plate is pretty busy.I happened to have an Olympus lens hood that fits many of the Olympus 35 series cameras, so I attached it before I went out to shoot with it.  I loaded a roll of Ilford XP-2, and shot the roll on one afternoon at the Biltmore Estate in Asheville.  Using this camera is pretty simple - just focus and shoot.  A small LED lights up to tell you that the battery has enough power to operate the camera, and if it stays on longer as you press the shutter, it means that it is in a low light situation.  There is a lever on the front that looks like a self-timer, but it is not - it's a shutter lock that probably also prevents the 2 alkaline cells from running down when not in use. The shutter is so quiet, that you may not even know that it fired.  Shutter speeds by the way, range from 4 sec to 1/800 sec, and the shutter speed/aperture (f/2.8 - f/13) is automatically set by the camera.  I would prefer that a camera have at least some bit if manual exposure control - either shutter priority or aperture priority, and this one is totally automatic.  If you are looking for that, the 35ECR will certainly be a camera to consider.I developed the XP-2 in D-76 - yeah, I know that XP-2 is a chromogenic  C-41 film, but it does very well in traditional black and white chemistry. I felt that there was underexposure in all of the frames, but the camera did focus well.  Perhaps setting the ISO to 200 instead of 400 because of the alkaline cells would fix the underexposure.I don't know how common this model is, but it's the first one that I have seen.  If I was looking for a compact Olympus 35 model, I'd probably go with the 35RC, just because it can be used with or without batteries, and everything is fully manual.    A few examples from the roll of XP-2. All required some post-work to adjust the brightness.Of course, the 42mm f/2.8 lens is sharp, and all of the images were perfectly focused.  I think that if I had compensated for the alkaline cells by setting the ISO to 200 instead of 400, it would have resulted in proper exposure."},
{"title": " Cheapest Entry into Panoramas, circa 1990s", "date": "Monday, August 30, 2021", "text": "Kodak's line of 35mm single-use \"disposable\" cameras  began in 1988, and the branding of them as \"Fun Saver\" started in 1989.  They featured a plastic body with a cardstock outer shell, and like the Fuji QuickSnap, were popular with consumers well into the digital age.  They may have been inexpensive, but the production of cheap, yet sharp acrylic lenses combined with an f/11 aperture and 400 ISO film usually resulted in acceptable photos for the consumer.  In the 1989, a cropped panorama (13x36mm negative image) model appeared, called the Kodak Stretch which featured a simple finder and 12 exposures. It was renamed the Kodak Fun Saver Panoramic 35, which was produced until 1999.  The last iteration of the Fun Saver Panorama 35 featured 15 exposures, and a viewfinder that provided a relatively accurate view of the scene. Combined with a rectangular lens hood and a 25mm f/12 lens, the camera  made acceptable color panoramic images of those vacation spots to countless tourists.  They sold for about $12-$15 at the time.  The fact that all of the images on the roll were the same format made it easier for photo labs to produce the panoramic prints.  It wasn't until the appearance of the APS film format in 1996 that consumer-grade panoramic photos would once again become popular, even though they were based on an even smaller image area than the 13x36 of 35mm. The first version was named \"Stretch 35\"Final version, late 1990s.  I acquired a Fun Saver Panoramic 35 about 6 years ago and it sat on a shelf - I don't even recall whether I had removed the original film and processed it.  After our move to NC it was in a box, and earlier this year I decided to open it up and reload it with Ilford XP-2 film.  While these cameras are reloadable, they are not like the Lomography Simple-Use camera or the Harman 35. They were meant to be reloaded in the factory,  so you will need to disassemble the camera before you can reload it.  The paper box covers over most of the workings of the camera, with access only for the shutter button, frame number, viewfinder, film advance, and lens.  To remove it from the box, you need to remove the lens shade, which is held in place by two prongs.   Once you remove the lens shade, the camera slides out of the cardstock box covering.  To open up the camera, look for an embossed label on the side and insert a small screwdriver a small screwdriver to pop the back open.  You'll see that the film cassette is on the take-up side, and the supply side is an empty spool.  You'll need to go into a darkroom or use a changing bag to roll film onto the supply spool and then place the two ends back into the body and close it up.  It works better with hand reloads, because the film counter only goes to 15, and if you have a 24 exposure roll of film, it will not expose the remaining frames.  I suggest either Ilford XP-2, Kentmere 400, Kodak Tri-X, or Fomapan 400.  You'll need to reset the frame counter by slightly lifting the clear top cover away and rotate the frame counter disk counter clockwise until 15 shows up in the raised window.  You will not be able to take any photos without doing this. You should do this before you load the film into the camera.Once those steps are done, reattach the back - it should snap into place without too much effort.  You may want to super glue the lens hood in place because one of the prongs will have probably lost a tooth when you removed it.Use some black paper tape to seal along the edges, just to avoid a light leak. Now you are ready to shoot with this fun little camera.I did all these things before I found out about the wonderful panoramic images done with this camera by Deon Reynolds on The Darkroom web site.  Reynolds adds a yellow filter to get more contrast with the sky when he uses a black and white film, such as Kodak Tri-X. Remove the pano mask and insert the gel filter right behind the lens and replace the mask. His images are really good, and will make you rethink what disposable cameras can do. The following images were shot on expired Ilford XP-2, developed in D-76.So, my first attempts with my reloaded Fun Saver Pano were pretty good. I shot mostly along the Blue Ridge Parkway near Asheville NC, with a few shots at the end of the roll from New Jersey. I have to say that I was impressed.  The key thing here is that the Fun Saver Pano 35 has a 25mm f/12 lens, which is perfect for the format.  You want a wide-angle in panoramic format, to get the most of the effect. I picked up two more empty Fun Saver Panoramic 35's for $1 plus shipping on eBay, so now I have three to take on my next road trip."},
{"title": "Shooting  41 Years Expired HP-5", "date": "Friday, August 13, 2021", "text": "I recently acquired a bunch of rolls of Ilford HP-5 that expired in Sept. 1980. Now, you know that I like testing the limits of what one can get from expired film, and a black and white 35mm film that's that old probably is going to be disappointing, right?  Well, follow along and see.In 1980, I was working on my Master's degree in Entomology at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, NY.  It was the year that I spent over 2 weeks on the road to the Southwest on a field trip.  I used a Pentax Spotmatic that I borrowed from my advisor, and shot Kodachrome and Ektachrome along that journey - and I still have those slides.  It was my first experience with the wide open West, and I learned quite a bit on that trip.  I am sure that I did not know a whit about Ilford film back then, as I was so used to the ever-present Kodak, though I know I did shoot some awful GAF slide film prior to 1980.  In 1980, Jimmy Carter was in the last year of a pivotal presidency.  In 1980, PacMan appeared as an arcade game, and Post-it notes were sold for the first time. That was also the year of the fantastic \"Miracle on Ice in lake Placid, NY, as the under-dog USA Hockey team beat the Soviet Union in the winter Olympics. Believe me, that was an exciting game.  It was also the year that Mount St. Helens erupted, causing significant destruction and altering the regional climate for a short time. It was the year the 7 rolls of Ilford HP-5 \"expired,\" locked away in someone's closet or camera bag to resurface 41 years later in a donation of photographic equipment.As I examined the boxes of film, I realized that Ilford had done some things with the packaging that I had not seen before.  Each plastic canister was sealed with a plastic strip that has to be torn away to open it and remove the film. The film has the typical long \"Leica leader\" that used to be on 35mm films, but probably stopped by the early 1980s.  The film cassette is reusable, as the ends can easily be removed.  Of course, the box also housed printed instructions on a sheet of paper. Interesting note, is that the instructions tell you to expose at 1/250 sec at f/16 under a full sun.  That's overexposing the film by a stop if it is rated at ISO 400. Also, the film is HP-5, not HP-5+, still rated at 400 ASA.  At first I thought it would be stupid to test the film, but then I realized it would be a good opportunity to see just what I could do with it.  I have shot long-expired Kodak Verichrome Pan with good results, as well as Kodak Panatomic-X. However, they are not fast films, and age better than a 400 ISO film.  Using my rule of thumb of losing a stop every decade, and factoring in that the film is black and white, I decided to shoot it at ISO 50.  I loaded a Vivitar V3800N SLR with the film and shot it all in one day in Weaverville. The V3800N is one of the cheaper SLRs that appears as many different brandings, but it's certainly capable enough for this simple test. I didn't bracket any of the shots, and used sunny-16 and the camera's meter to adjust my exposures.In the afternoon, I developed the film in HC-110B for 5 minutes. I chose HC-110 because it seems to limit fogging on old films.  As I pulled the developed film off the reel to hang it to dry, I was really pleased to see that I had images. The film has significant base fog, but I knew that it would scan pretty well.  I scanned the negs with my Epson V700 scanner, and the thumbnails of the pre-scan looked really good. The film has a slight cupping, like Kodak Tri-X, making the center of the scan a little less sharp. There are some blotchy lines across the length of some of the frames - and I don't know what they are due to.  Here are some of the scans below.You can see that they are little grainy, but overall, not bad.  My guess of shooting it at ISO 50 was correct. I certainly did not expect that the results would be as good as they are.It's hard to judge the results without knowing the history of how a film was stored over its lifespan.  It could have been in any number of places, and I doubt that any of them would be a freezer.  The exciting fact is that this film, probably produced in 1978 or 79 is still usable (with some adjustment).  I know that some people wonder why in hell anyone would use long-expired film. I certainly would not use it for anything critical, but part of the fun is seeing how much life that old roll of silver halides still has after all these years.  It's also a of a treasure hunt - sometimes one can find some film that will really amaze with its staying power. Other times, it's a dud.  These rolls of HP-5 are usable, but not without some minor flaws.  However, one person's grainy negative is another person's art niche.  I may put the remaining rolls up on Etsy, so check it out soon."},
{"title": "Secreted Away", "date": "Tuesday, August 03, 2021", "text": "It's always gratifying to have an image accepted for a publication.  These days, there are so many people submitting work to magazines and judged exhibits that it must be overwhelming for those people that have to review the work.  I suppose that's the rationale for so many zines out there - self-publish to get your work in the hands of others.  Online galleries are nice, but having an image in print is the real thing in your hands.  While I view Monochrome Mania as my personal outlet for my work, you'll never see it on a newsstand.  So, getting an image in a magazine with a larger audience is pretty exciting.  It's not my first published image, for sure, but nevertheless, it's very gratifying.After I returned from my trip to NY and NJ, I was going through may mail, and opened up the envelope from SHOTS Magazine - a quarterly journal of black and white photography.  The theme for the summer issue (#152) is Secret Worlds, and of the 6 images I entered, one was selected, which appears on page 43 - shown below.  The title is \"Secreted Away\", and the subject is an old wood card file with one drawer open. The story behind the subject isn't given, but I will explain it hereSecreted AwayThe photo was taken in 2014 in the Bird Division in the old Museum of Zoology that was housed in the Ruthven Museums Building (University of Michigan), as we were preparing for a major move. One of the things about that building was the pervasive sense of history one would get after working there for a while. That wood card file contained thousands of 3x5 cards with observation data of various bird species from over a century ago.  I suppose some of that has been digitized by now, because the data is valuable. However, secreted away in those old file drawers meant that one would have to know that the cards were there.  I worked as a collection manager at the Museum of Zoology from 1981 - 2016, and wish that I had photographed it when I first started working there.  In 2016, the University started moving all of the collections, artifacts, files, books, and people from the main campus natural history museums to an off-campus state-of-the-art facility in a renovated warehouse on Varsity Drive.  I retired from the University at the end of 2017, having overseen the move of our insect collections and related materials.  The new facility is a sterile building that does not have the character or comforting feel of the old Ruthven Museums.  I no longer live in Ann Arbor, and my museum days are past, but sometime, I will have to compile some images of the \"old museum\" into a publication just so no one forgets what a great, if dated, place that it was. By the way, SHOTS Magazine is an awesome photography journal."},
{"title": "Monochrome Mania #5 - Lens Dreams", "date": "Thursday, July 15, 2021", "text": "What is it about memories and photography?  I know that when I see a photograph that I have taken, I’ll usually remember the situation or place or when I made it, just by seeing the image. If you asked me where I was at a particular time, I probably could not tell you.  However, an image can immediately wake those neurons and give me pretty good recall of the event or place. We are used to photographs that are pretty much “perfect” in that the exposure is good, the detail sharp, and the subject recognizable.  Our memories, however, are not as good as the photographs.  Memories fade, events become blurred, and timelines are not exact.  As I have grown older, I realize that there are events that I just cannot remember – possibly because they were trivial at the time, and as people sometimes say “Photos, or it didn’t happen.”  My thoughts on doing Lens Dreams are to show that photography can mimic memory. Images can be fuzzy, dreamlike, out-of-focus – much like memory, and that is my aim here.  I know that the term “Lens of Nostalgia” could also be used, here, but that imparts a different feeling, one that has been attributed to toy camera photographs, and those using older techniques and processes.  Is nostalgia bad?  I don’t think so – in today’s world of instant gratification and an endless parade of digital perfection, many people, including myself, see reality differently.My latest Monochrome Mania was all done with Lensbaby and other imperfect optics that give me the dreamy look that I wanted. Images date from 2007 to the present year, collected in a 36 page zine with covers. I am really pleased with my latest effort, and I hope that you'll enjoy it, too.  You can purchase it directly from my Etsy store for $12 with free shipping in the USA, and $6 additional for outside the US for International First Class.  I won't be shipping any orders until after July 26, as I'll be away."},
{"title": " Zeiss Ikon Symbolica ", "date": "Monday, July 12, 2021", "text": "A few years ago, I acquired a few oddball cameras from a friend's estate, and among them was this Zeiss-Ikon Symbolica.  I wasn't even sure that it worked as it has a couple of internal chips in the lens.   Anyhow, I finally decided to  load it with film a few weeks ago and give it a test.  Typically, when one thinks of Zeiss Ikon - well at least Zeiss,  well-made lenses and robust cameras come to mind.  Carl Zeiss was founded in 1846, and was a respected optics manufacturer. Located in Jena, Germany, Zeiss produced now well-known lens designs such as the Zeiss Anastigmat (1890), Zeiss Planar (1896), and Zeiss Tessar (1902).  The Tessar design is well known, and consists of 4 elements in 3 groups.  The Greek word tessera means four, hence the name of the lens.   By Tamasflex - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11794560From Wikipedia:\"Millions of Tessar lenses have been created by Zeiss and other manufacturers, and are still produced as excellent intermediate aperture lenses. The famous 50mm f/3.5 Elmar lenses used in the first Leica cameras were of this type, designed by Max Berek in 1920. Actually, Zeiss has a large monopoly on this type of construction, because Rudolph's patent was very general.  His only claim was:\"A spherically, chromatically and astigmatically corrected objective consisting of 4 lenses separated by the diaphragm into two groups, each of two lenses, of which group one includes a pair of facing surfaces and the other a cemented surface, the power of the pair of facing surfaces being negative and that of the cemented surface positive\". \"So, to all those people that go crazy when they see a camera with a Zeiss Tessar lens on a camera such as the Contax T4 - (made by Kyocera, who also owned the Yashica brand), get over it!  Case in point -- the Zeiss Ikon Symbolica, which I guarantee I will get to.The end of World War II caused a problem for Zeiss, as Jena was in the East German USSR-Occupied Zone, and many of the Zeiss engineers went to West Germany ahead of the Russian occupation.  The new Zeiss Ikon A.G. was based in Stuttgart, with the old Zeiss Ikon in Jena and Dresden. Due to trademark litigation, the East German brand became Pentacon.  In its heyday, Zeiss Ikon manufactured a bewildering number of cameras, often with similar names and a numbering scheme within a name that differentiated the variants.  Zeiss-Ikon made everything from plate cameras to box cameras, Contax, Contaflex, Ikonta and Nettar folding cameras, and the camera under review here, the Symbolica.The Symbolica shown here, is in fact, a Symbolica II, produced from 1960-62.  It features a bright frame viewfinder with projected frame lines as well as a match-needle exposure readout in the finder.  Its simplified layout belies the fact that it's an automatic exposure point and zone-focus camera that merely requires you to get the exposure needle centered and then take a shot.  The camera features a 50mm f/2.8 Tessar (see I told you there was a connection), and a Prontomat shutter.  The Selenium meter cell to the left of the viewfinder powers the exposure system, so no batteries are required.The bottom of the Symbolica. Note the ASA settings bandVery minimalist top deck. The apertures on theright side of the barrel are for use with flash only.Taking a further look at this camera, it is obvious that it's well-built, which is to be expected from Zeiss Ikon.  However, given the market is was aimed for - the casual shooter, it's clear that casual shooter market segment was going to be overtaken by more inexpensive Kodak Instamatic that appeared in 1963, as well as cheaper Japanese-made 35mm cameras.  Using the Symbolica I had initial doubts that I'd get anything useful from this camera.  It just seemed unlikely that it would still be  fully functional after all these years.  I loaded a roll of Ilford XP-2, and set the ASA setting to 320 on the band under the lens barrel.   The camera has what you might call programmed exposure, as you merely rotate the control ring with the sunny setting back and forth until the meter needle  is centered. I guess that controls both aperture and shutter speed, but there is no way to know what exactly is changing.  I made an initial mistake of turning to the marked aperture settings, thinking that I was smarter than the camera, but no -- those marked apertures are for use with a dedicated flash (that I don't have).  So, for shooting outdoors - which is what the sun represents, turn the control ring back and forth until the needle is centered in the viewfinder, and press the shutter button. Focus is via zones - one head, etc.,  to mountains, although there is a numbered focus distance on the underside of the lens barrel.  Two lens defects - at 4 and 6 o'clock look like chips in the edge of the rear of the front element.Once I convinced myself that it was all that simple, I shot the roll in a couple of days, rewound the film, and developed the XP-2 in D-76. (Ilford XP-2 develops beautifully in standard b&w chemistry as well as C-41).  I have to say, this is a very robustly built camera. The rewind is on the bottom, and everything seems to work easily and smoothly.  The shutter is very quiet, and the minimal controls worked pretty well.  Since I didn't follow the instructions online, the first 5 exposures were way overexposed, so I am guessing that the flash shutter speed is 1/30 sec.  After that, I used the exposure dial correctly, and all of the images were actually quite good.  The chips in the front element(?)  did not seem to affect the results. The Symbolica is a symbol of German over-engineering and the beginning of automatic cameras, as well as the demise of the heavy-metal bodied cameras of the 1950s. The 1960s would usher in a dizzying seismic shift in camera production and innovation from Germany to Japan.More Reviews and information on the SymbolicaPhotoethnographyButkus.org manualZeiss Ikon HistoryEbay prices for this camera are under $50, so it's not expensive to find one."},
{"title": " How Could I Ignore My Rollei 35TE?", "date": "Thursday, July 08, 2021", "text": "Last week, I was going through my drawer of smaller 35mm cameras, and on a whim, I opened up a leather case to see what was inside. Right. It was my Rollei 35 TE, which I probably had not shot with for a bunch of years.  The slow shutter speeds were off - as in anything at 1/15 sec or slower = B, but the rest were just fine.  That might have been the reason I hadn't used it, but I suspect it was more likely that with all the newer compact cameras such as the Olympus XA, Minox 35, Olympus Infinity, Chinon Bellami, Minolta AF-C, and so forth, the Rollei 35 got pushed to the back where I ignored it.  This particular Rollei 35 is possibly the camera that I have had the longest, aside from a Kodak Retina IIa, as both were gifts from my then mentor, Bill Brudon.  One day I was visiting  Bill, and he handed me two Rollei 35 cameras. One was a Rollei 35 S in chrome, and the other was a black 35 TE.  He asked which one I preferred, and after a few seconds of shock, I told him the TE,   I guess because it was all-black.  \"It's yours, then!\"  Bill said. That was in 2001, so I have had the camera for 20 years, the longest that I have owned any particular camera.I used it quite a bit early on, even taking it on a trip to NM and CO in 2003, where it produced excellent results - even on slide film.  The thing about the Rollei 35 models is that they are jewel-like, fully manual metal-bodied compacts that are incredibly innovative and also just a bit frustrating.  The film advance lever is on the left side, which is the slightly annoying part.  It's not a rangefinder, so one has to gauge distance while rotating the front of the  lens to focus, and red/green diodes tell you when you have adjusted the exposure to where it should be. It takes a 5.6 V Mercury PX27 battery (and I had several extras for years), which I found was now dead, and replaced it with a Silver Oxide S27PX.  If you are not relying on the camera's meter, you don't need to bother with a battery.  The meter's not especially reliable in low-light, but outdoors it does pretty well in most situations.After replacing the battery, I popped in a roll of Ultrafine Extreme 400 film. The interesting/annoying thing about the Rollei 35 is that to load film, the back comes completely off, and you flip open a \"door\" which acts as a pressure plate and keeps the film really secure across the width of its travel from the cassette to the take-up spool, which is to say, a very short journey in this compact camera.  More about the Rollei 35 series The Rollei 35 is a \"high-class\" compact camera that was introduced in 1966 and sold until about 1999.  The first version was just the Rollei 35, with later models offering improvements, and differentiating between the models with Sonnar (40mm f/2.8) and Tessar (40mm f/3.5)  lenses with S and T, and later, SE and TE.  I think the additional E just means \"Electronic.\" Early models were made in Germany, and later, most models were manufactured in Singapore - but not all.  The final versions - higher-priced specialty models , were made in Germany in the 1990s.   These cameras appeal to collectors, since there are many iterations of the Rollei 35, including  gold-plated models. You can expect to pay a premium price for the special editions, and the plain-vanilla Rollei 35 in very good condition will still set you back a couple of hundred bucks.  What makes these cameras so darn cool is that they have excellent 40mm  lenses, a telescoping lens tube, which makes them very compact to carry, rugged design, and shutter speeds from B, 1/2 - 1/500 sec.  They do have a hot-shoe for flash, but it's on the bottom of the camera! The bright albada viewfinder is a nice feature with projected frame-lines.  They are very quiet to shoot with as well.  You can also put one on a tripod and use a cable release, just like a much larger camera.  In doing some internet sleuthing - it appears that because the shutter is tensioned when not in use, spending a long time unused isn't good for the less than 1/30 shutter speeds. That explains why my camera has that problem.I took my Rollei 35TE on a visit to Marshall, NC and shot the entire roll of the UFX 400.  It was a sunny day, and the metering and my sunny-16 sense were sympatico.  Of course, since almost everything I shot was farther than 20 feet, I just left the focus on infinity and the aperture at f/11 or f/16.  I developed the film last night, and all of the shots were excellent.  How can it be that I let this camera linger in the shadows for so long?  Maybe I am more confident now with shooting a camera that doesn't have a rangefinder focus? Maybe it's experience?   Whatever the reason, I need to take this camera out more often.  It need not be sitting in the back of the drawer like an old pair of socks.Some examples from Marshall, NC Some Rollei 35 Resources -Caual Photophile - https://casualphotophile.com/2017/03/24/rollei-35-se-camera-review/Japan Camera Hunter - https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2014/09/rollei-35-review-david-aureden/Mike Eckman - https://www.mikeeckman.com/2021/02/rollei-35-t-1974/Mike Butkus' camera manuals - http://www.cameramanuals.org/rolleiflex/rollei_35_s.pdf"},

{"title": " Out and About with the Argus CR-1 SLR", "date": "Tuesday, June 22, 2021", "text": "Welcome to a review of yet another Chinon M42-mount SLR, albeit badged as the Argus CR-1.  Chinon produced the CR-1 in 1975, and in fact, produced a series under the CR line, the CR-1, CR-2, and CR-3E.  While bearing the Argus logo, it appears that Argus did not distribute the cameras, but were distributed by the IMC Division of Interphoto Corporation.  The first thing one notices about this SLR is the strange flattened curvy prism housing.   I actually like it, as it's a big change from what everyone else was doing. However, it also bears noting that the Voigtlander/Rollei SL35 of 1976 has a similarly shaped prism housing.  The second obvious thing about this camera is only apparent when you hold it - it's a beast, and built like a tank.  Much of my information about this camera comes from Henry Gambino's excellent book, \"Argomania.\"  However, Mr. Gambino made an error when he said the camera has a cloth focal plane shutter.  It's not - it's a metal-bladed, vertically travelling Copal Square shutter that was commonly seen in Cosina and Chinon cameras.  The shutter has the typical B, 1-1/1000 speeds, and the ASA markings go from 10 to 1600. The metering is stop-down, and the meter is actuated by pressing halfway down on the shutter release, with the typical +/- metering needle indicator on the right of the viewfinder.   Simple control layout, nothing you don't need.My example of the the CR-1 came with the 55mm f/2 Argus Auto-Cintar lens, which has the matching indentations on the focus ring that you see on the shutter speed and rewind dials. I purchased the camera on eBay  in November 2020, and paid $30 + shipping. When I was actively engaged in Argus collecting (2002-2011), the CR series SLRS would often show up at camera swaps, and because they were not actually made by Argus, I was not that interested in them. I remember someone selling new in box CR-1s that were probably bought when stores were dumping excess inventory, when somewhat generic M42-mount cameras could no longer compete with the K-mounts, Canons, Nikons, and Minoltas of 1980.  Once I was sure that the camera worked as advertised, it became my \"keep in the car\" SLR.  I also paired it with with the lovely Zenit Helios 44-M 58mm f/2 lens. With black and white film in it, it's always there should I need it.  Paired with the Helios M-44 58mm f/2 Soviet lens anda vintage Argus-branded flash unit.Two features on the camera that I really like - the locking collar around the shutter button to prevent accidental exposures, and the large shutter button.  That Copal Square shutter sure makes a loud kerchunk when it fires, so there's no question that I have taken a photo.  The body has a typical hotshoe on the prism as well as PC connectors from X and M next to the lens mount.  The flash sync is 1/125 sec.  While I have read that the CR-1s have a decal with the model name, mine is definitey engraved on the front. The camera with a lens weighs 2.5 pounds, which is pretty hefty.  The tank-like build reminds me of the Ricoh Singlex TLS from the late 1960s.  Overall, the CR-1's design is its standout feature, as it has pretty much the same features as most M-42 mount SLRs of its time. The beauty of the M42 mount, or Praktica Screw mount is that you can find lenses for it for almost nothing.  As I have written before on RCB, there are a lot of wonderful M42 SLRs out there, with the Pentax Spotmatic F at the top of my list.  The Argus CR-1 is no Spotmatic F, but it sure isn't a  Zenit, either.  Chinon made a lot of SLRs, but the CR-1 stands out from the crowd. Note, if you live in Europe, you re more likely to find a Photo Quelle Revueflex 1001, which is the same camera, but with a different name.Here are a few images from my CR-1, loaded with Ultrafine Extreme 100 film, developed in D76 1:1.Dogwood buds in MarchBig CreekBig Creek fallsRiverside Arts DistrictGiant Allium going to seed.Tired doggySunny Daisies"},
{"title": " The Camera in the Console", "date": "Friday, June 11, 2021", "text": "The original Olympus Infinity StylusSeveral weeks ago, I was doing some clean-up inside my Ford Escape, and pulled out the old Olympus Stylus that had been sitting in the bottom of the center console storage compartment.  I don't recall how long I had kept it there, but it had a fully shot roll of Ilford HP-5+ in it.  It is the first version of the Stylus, as it has the 35mm f/3.5 lens, and it certainly is a good picture-taker.  I suppose that I had put it in the console so that I would always have a film camera available if I needed it.  That's not a bad idea, of course, and I was smart to use a b&w film to reduce the effects of the ravages of heat in the car.So, yesterday I developed the roll of HP-5+ that was in the camera, and it must have been in the car at least 3 years.  There were lots of photos from Ann Arbor, a couple from a trip to NJ to record FPP segments, a stop for ice cream in Perry, MI, and some from places I can't quite figure out. The idea of a small camera that's available on a whim is a good idea, but I think I should have kept a small notebook to record where I took the photos.  Of course, maybe if it hadn't been in the car for 3 or 4 years, it would not have been so difficult to remember!There is something to be said for the developing of a roll of film that's been forgotten about. Often times, we get surprises and find little vignettes that we had forgotten about but were important enough to photograph at the time. Of course, in my case, I photograph so much that's its almost like breathing.  One of the big advantages of using a smart phone to shoot serendipitous images, is the fact that it records the location data and date of each image file. That's been very useful for me over the years, as I have had to recall where I was at a given time.  While the Olympus infinity doesn't have that capability, it does a good job of recording a scene onto a piece of film.  Of course, looking at the film later, leaves me with questions, and maybe that's a good thing. We need to use our brains to figure out puzzles, and as we age, it gets even more important.  Here are a few images from the roll of film.

{"title": " Quick Trip - One Camera", "date": "Thursday, June 10, 2021", "text": "Last weekend I drove to Ann Arbor, Michigan from Weaverville, NC. It's about 11 hrs on the road, including rest stops, etc.  The purpose was to drive Beverley's vehicle with her to Michigan, and then I would return by air to NC the next day, and Bev would continue on to her parents in Ontario.  I knew that there wouldn't be a lot of time for photography, and I felt that digital would prevent any missteps at the TSA check in. I have flown many times before with film cameras, but I felt that a DSLR would be the easiest course this time.  However, I wanted something light, inexpensive, and not bulky.  The best candidate that I had was this Canon EOS Rebel XSi with the 24mm f/2.8 EFS STM lens.  I could have just used my iPhone XR, but there are times when a DSLR is so much better.The Canon EOS Rebel XSi, a 12 MP DSLR introduced in 2008.Now you probably are thinking \"what's going on with Mark, I thought he was a dedicated Nikon user?\" If you know me well, you'd know that I like to have a big toolbox, and I chose this combo because - lightweight, compact, good results - 12.8 MP, sensor, sharp lens, and it barely extends beyond the flash/mirror box. The Rebel XSi certainly isn't the latest (introduced in 2008), but you know what? It doesn't need to be. In fact, the lens costs more than a used body. The Rebel XSi is still a pretty decent entry-level DSLR with a cropped sensor, hence the EF-S lenses.  For a pretty thorough review from 2008 go to: http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/camerareview/canon-rebel-xsi-review/side view. Compact, eh?With the 24mm pancake lens, the Rebel XSi is really lightweight and a lot of fun to shoot with. While the entry-level Nikons have a more refined feel and familiar user experience for me, I didn't have a DSLR that matched the Canon's attributes for this trip.  In fact, Nikon has nothing like the 24mm STM lens.  I didn't shoot much on the road on the Saturday driving towards Michigan, but on Sunday I had some time to do some shooting in Ann Arbor.  I had breakfast at Zingerman's Road House on Maple Road, which was a real treat. The Nichols Arboretum Peony Garden was at its peak, and since Adrienne used to be the person in charge of it, I knew that she would love to see some images of it this year.  The 24mm lens (36 mm equivalent in full-frame) did a great job with closeups as well as the bigger picture.  A bit of a walk at the edge of campus, and then it was time for me to go to Detroit Metro (DTW) to get on a flight to Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. I don't think I have ever seen so few people at DTW, and the line through the TSA checkpoint was very short.    It was my first time walking to the B concourse, and the big tunnel with the \"light show\" was new to me.  My flight back was uneventful, and Adrienne picked me up at the airport (which has all of 10 gates).  We then went back into Greenville for some dinner and a walk in the lovely Reedy River Falls Park.  Then it was back home to Weaverville!It was a bit of a surreal weekend, driving N to Michigan and flying home the next day. On the way into Michigan along US-23, we were greeted by a number of new billboards adverstising the pot dispensaries in Ann Arbor. That was perhaps the biggest change since we left Michigan.  The images that follow are all from the Canon Rebel XSi. Some were shot on b&w, the rest shot in color.I always loved the artwork associated with Zingerman'sThe Circle-K station was built  just about the time we left in 2019.Just say high!Peony Garden Entranceso many great peony flowersUM School of Public HealthObservatory Lodge.

{"title": " The Nikon F4 - Still An Amazing SLR", "date": "Saturday, May 22, 2021", "text": "Nikon F4 with a lovely 50mm f/1.4 manual lensI recently came into possession of a Nikon F4 that is in excellent condition.  I really hadn't thought about all the features that it has, since the last time I shot with one was well over 15 years ago.  The local Ann Arbor camera store, Big Georges (which stopped selling photographic stuff in 2008) had a used one for sale that I purchased to do some freelance work.  It ended up having a problem that reinforced my \"always have a backup\" plan. I was shooting an event and realized that the film was being advanced through to the end of the roll while never firing an exposure!  Luckily, my backup was the consumer-level Nikon N60, and I was able to get all the shots that I needed.  But, for a few moments, I was in a panic. I ended up selling that F4 with its problems noted, and never bought another one.  So, a few months ago, one sort of landed in my lap, and I started shooting with it.  Comparing it to an F2 or F3 is a little unfair, as the technology in the F4 is far more advanced than its predecessors. It's certainly a lot heavier and beefier. But, with its grip on the right side, it feels right in the hands.  The large, bright 100% viewfinder is truly great, and having the hot shoe on the prism like most cameras, is a far better solution than the F, F2, and F3 location.  The Nikon F4 was produced from 1988-1997.  It was an innovative breakthrough for Nikon, parting ways with the older manual-focus F cameras, yet retaining use of any lens, including non-AI. It works with all modern Nikon AF lenses, including G lenses (but not in A and M modes).  If you prefer knobs and buttons over LCD menus, this is the camera for you.  In fact, every feature on the F4 is readily identifiable and does not have to dealt with via a menu. Shutter speeds are from 30 sec to 1/8000 sec, plus B and T, and ISO settings from 6 to 6400. The information in the viewfinder is easily seen, and of course, you can manually set the lens aperture in A and M modes.  It's a perfect SLR to use with manual lenses, as you see focus confirmation in the viewfinder. In fact, while I often use the F4 with AF lenses, I love using it with a manual AI-modified 50mm f/1.4 Nikkor-S lens from the late 1960s. Everything is easily found, and no menus or LCD screens Everything is so clear and bright in the viewfinder that it's a real treat to use this camera.  The Nikon N90, while lighter, has many of the features of the F4, but it does contain an LCD screen and has mode buttons, and a primitive menu system.  None of that's in the F4.  I have used N90s quite a bit, and while excellent SLRs, they are not as rugged as the F4.  All the controls are where they should be (at least to a Nikon user) and are non-ambiguous.  Flash sync is at 1/250 sec., and the incredible array of Nikon Speedlights gives you so much more control over your flash photography than the F2 or F3.  Matrix-balanced fill flash, center-weighted fill-flash, rear-curtain sync, standard TTL flash, and multiple flashes are all options.   I'm not going to list all of the features of this camera, as they are easily findable on the Internet.  However, one feature that might escape notice is where the cable release connects to the camera.  - It's on the lower left rear, below the film door.  It actually makes a great deal of sense having it there, rather than part of the shutter release on top right, where it's usually found on most cameras. One other feature that I appreciate -- it uses 4 AA cells, not some expensive battery. Since it doesn't have an LCD screen, those AAs last quite a while.The F4 with a great travel lens - the 24-120 AF-D.This second go-round with the F4 has been most enjoyable, and the more I use it, the more I appreciate just how rock solid the camera is.  It was Nikon's flagship professional camera for almost a decade, and it was totally a major leap forward in pro camera technology compared to the electronic F3.  Don't get me wrong -- I think the F3HP is one of the greatest SLRS made, but the F4 certainly is a camera that sits well with the manual and the AF worlds, and is still an awesome SLR.  It's not a lightweight camera - with the 50mm f/1.4 and neck strap, it weighs 3.5 pounds.  Put on the 35-70 f/2.8 AFD lens, and that will be 4 lb 4 oz around your neck.  I carry mine over my shoulder.  One might be tempted to think that if the F4 is good, the F5 and F6 are better.  Using those two cameras is not much different than using a DSLR, and if you have used an F100, you would immediately know the controls on a D300. So, user-interface-wise, the F4 stands out amongst any pro-level AF 35mm SLR.So, is the Nikon F4 right for you? Only you can answer that. Find one and shoot with it for a while, and you'll quickly see how great a camera it is.Want to know more about the Nikon F4?

{"title": "Nikon FE10 - Hands On Review", "date": "Friday, May 07, 2021", "text": "I recently decided that it was time to reduce the number of camera systems that I had been keeping on-hand, so I sold my Cosina-manufactured Canon T60 and lenses that I have had for a few years.  I replaced it almost immediately with a mint-condition Nikon FE10 from KEH.  I'd been wanting an FE10, because operationally, it was very similar to the T60, as both were made by Cosina. You may not have heard of the FE10, as it was only made for a short time in the mid-late 1990s, and it was not as common as the FM10, also a Cosina body that features only manual settings.  Why an FE10?  I really liked the lightweight Aperture-priority Canon T60, and the Nikon FE10 is similar, but with more features.  Just as lightweight, it comes in at 1 lb 6 oz with a 50mm f1.8 Nikkor, camera strap, and roll of film.  Obviously, an ABS plastic body, with that champagne silver and black body that we also saw in the Nikon N60.  While it obviously isn't a typical Nikon build, the FE10 has the following features:  Aperture-Priority and Manual exposure, with speeds indicated via diodes in the VF. Shutter speeds B, 1-1/2000 sec (in A mode, up to 8 seconds) Flash Sync at 1/60 and 1/90 with Nikon TTL Speedlights ISO settings 25-3200 Exposure lock button Exposure compensation dial built-in with ISO settings. Cable release socket in shutter release button Depth of field preview leverSelf-timer Film roll window in back Multiple-exposure lever Lock setting on shutter speed dial to conserve battery power and avoid accidental exposures Viewfinder - 93% coverage, with matte focus screen, microprism collar and split-image center spot (Nikon \"K\" screen) Power- 2 1.5V LR-44 cells (required to operate camera) Some Observations - Manual Nikon SLRs have the shutter lock when the advance lever is flush against the body and once the lever is brought out about 30 degrees, the meter is activated and the camera will operate.  After using Nikons for over 20 years, it's an automatic thing that I rarely think about.  However, I recall a couple of times when I put a Nikon FE in a bag and the advance lever got pulled away, resulting in drained cells when I tried using the camera.  The Lock setting on the shutter speed dial is a good feature, especially for those that might not have a long history with Nikon SLRs. Shutter speed dial set to Aperture-priorityISO and exp. compensation dial Exposure compensation dials are typically separate when they are included on a Nikon SLR - i.e., all AF camera bodies, and on the Nikon FE, FE2, FG, FA, FM3a, F3, and N2000.  Manual-only bodies do not require the +\\- exposure comp. dial.  At first I thought this  setup was a bit ungainly on the FE10, but in reality, it does teach how +/- works - you are setting the ISO speed +/- in stops. So, if I have ISO 400 film and I want a stop extra of exposure, I set the dial to the +1, and the ISO speed is set at 50.  The only drawback with this setup is that you might forget to change back to the actual film ISO.  It's a compromise, but it does work. The shutter release does not require much force to activate, but once I got used to it, I had no problems.Using the FE10 - After I received the camera from KEH, I installed 2 fresh LR-44 cells, and popped in a roll of Ultrafine Extreme 400.  I have to say that the only thing the FE10 lacked was that new camera smell, (Okay, I confess, there is no such thing).  The body looked like it had never been used.  I used it with a Nikon SB-18 Speedlight - a small flash that is a perfect match for this camera. I also shot it with several lenses, under different conditions, and I was so sure of the operation of the FE10 that I packed it as my only SLR for a long weekend in Pittsburgh. Once I got used to the touchy shutter release, I found using it to be good experience. The FE10 was a good choice, as I visited some interesting areas, one of which was Carrie Furnaces National Historic Site.  There were a few times when I used the exposure compensation dial to accommodate the dark tones of the site.  The FE10's simplicity of operation and the Aperture-priority automation makes it a great choice as a street camera.  The lighter weight was nice, too. Of course, it's not like a Nikon FE2 (weight 2 lb, 3 oz in a similar configuration) either in sturdiness or feel. It was designed for countries that wanted cheaper cameras with the Nikon badge all while AF bodies were the rage.  The FE10 and FM10 may not have been built like other Nikons, but as a \"student\" camera, I certainly can recommend them.  As a backup body, the FE10 would be so light to pack in with the rest of your gear, you might not notice it's there. I'm not going to be a snob and turn up my nose at the FE10, just because it's not made in a Nikon factory.  If you want a bit more about the history of this camera - check out this review.  The only manual focus Nikon body I have that's newer is the FM3a.Overall, I found the FE10 to be a good companion on my Pittsburgh trip. I shot 6 rolls of film with it, and all the exposures were to my liking. I'll probably be using this camera in my travels, as I easily packed it in a shoulder bag with a flash and several lenses. I have other Nikons that are better-made, fuller-featured, but heavier.  I can see packing my FM3a with the FE10 as a backup on a trip. As a walk-about camera, the FE10 won't weigh me down, and based upon my results, it's a better choice than a 40-year old Nikon FE.  And now, for some photos..."},
{"title": " A Week at the South Carolina Coast", "date": "Friday, April 23, 2021", "text": "Sunset at Murrells Inlet, SCI hesitate to use the word vacation, because I am retired, but it was a vacation from the kitchen renovation that is ongoing. We went to Murrells Inlet, SC for a week in mid-April, and it really was nice to do some traveling after a year of not doing any travel, other than day trips around NC.  Of course, we took the necessary precautions - mask up, and all that, and Bev was vaccinated, I had my first COVID shot, and Adrienne got hers shortly after we returned from our trip.  It was great to see the Atlantic, as it's been 22 years since I have been to the Atlantic coast. We left Weaverville on the morning of April 10, and arrived in the afternoon at our cottage that we rented for the week. It was little like going from Spring to summer-like weather.  It was great to have a real kitchen, as we have been making do with an ersatz kitchenette in the basement while our real kitchen is being completely renovated.  Even so, we ate dinner out a lot over the course of a week, as we had all that fresh and local seafood at the local restaurants.Morning on the porchFirst of all, Murrells Inlet is along what is called the \"Hammock Coast,\" inland by the width of salt marshes from the Strand, a series of barrier islands that protect the marshes from the waves of the Atlantic.  Funny though, is seeing all those beachfront properties as easy prey to the effects of climate change.  At least there is less of an onslaught along the shoreline that is surrounded by the estuaries.Our small cottage was perfect for our needs, and I enjoyed the quiet mornings there.  We were only a few minutes walk from the busy area with all of the restaurants, bars, and tourist-oriented places, yet we felt like we were in a very quiet spot.  I enjoyed the mornings with the sun casting shadows on the porch. Our rented cottageOne of the places that we visited - three times, in fact, was Brookgreen Gardens.  Admission on one ticket is good for 6 consecutive days, and in light of how much there is to Brookgreen, it certainly makes sense.  For the history of Brookgreen Gardens, go to https://www.brookgreen.org/history-gardens.  Brookgreen Gardens has over 2000 pieces of figurative sculpture in a garden setting, and I have to say that I was wowed by what I saw. Aside from seeing several works by two sculptors well-known by Michiganders (Marshall Fredericks and Carl Milles), I was introduced to Anna Hyatt Huntington's amazing work and many others. Of course, all this is in addition to the fabulous gardens and plantings, the Low Country Museum and the zoo. I spent many hours just walking around and loving the Tillandsia (although it's often called Spanish Moss, it's not Spanish and it's not moss - it's an epiphytic Bromeliad) hanging from the Live Oaks (Quercus virginiana).  To me, those trees exemplify the deep South, and with those long, arching branches, they provide a mysterious and languorous scene.  They also support other epiphytic plants such as lichens, mosses, and ferns. I photographed the hell out of them, seeking ways to convey that sense of wonder and place that they provide.  I'll know if I succeeded when I develop the film.Don Quixote sculpture by Anna Hyatt HuntingtonLive Oaks at Brookgreen GardensOn the other side of Route 17, across from Brookgreen gardens, lies Huntington Beach State park.  This parcel is where the Huntingtons built their winter retreat, which Archer Huntington called Atalaya. He had a passion for Spanish history and literature, and Atalaya was designed to look like the coastal forts of Spain. It's now called Atalaya Castle, and is a shell of its former residence. Although I enjoyed walking around and through it, it seems a melancholy place. However, it provided some great photographic subjects, which I also hope come out the way that I saw them.  The beach area is large, and the North end of the beach is the best place for photography and wildlife viewing.  The south end is more managed for typical beach and camping activities.  Atalaya Castle (Lumix DMC-LX3)The North end of Huntington Beach State ParkSeaside memoriesWe also spent an afternoon in Georgetown, the third-oldest city in SC, incorporated in 1729. The historic district is a nice walk, and there are lots of beautiful old houses on the National Historic Register.  Georgetown is the second-largest seaport in SC and has several large industries. I did enjoy seeing that there is an old theater there, the Strand, which hosts theater and no longer shows movies. The Inlet Crab HouseWe ate one meal at a restaurant every day, usually dinner. My two favorite places were the Inlet Crab House - a small place that seemed to cater more to locals, and the Hot Fish Club - which is a big place that offered up some of the best meals I have ever had.  All of the places around Murrells Inlet feature seafood, and a lot of it is fried.  That's why the Hot Fish Club was so excellent - there are many non-fried options to choose from, and we ate there two nights. We ate lunch at Wicked Tuna one day, and I had the most amazing shrimp Po'Boy ever.  I was also introduced to She Crab soup, which I tried at two different places, and it's a luscious mouthful of buttery crab meat and roe. Graham's Landing had the best version. I also found that Grouper was my favorite local fish.A shrimp po'boy at Wicked TunaOkay, this IS a photography blog, not a restaurant review, so I'll list what I brought along for this trip. I decided that my Pentax 6x7 wasn't giving me enough exercise, so I packed it and several lenses into a backpack. I also brought my YashicaMat 124, and Holga, to round out the medium-format section. Imagine my chagrin when I went to load the P67 and found that I had left the take-up spool at home.  I wasn't going to ruin a roll of film just to have a take-up spool, so I waited until I finished up a roll in the YashicaMat to transfer it to the P67. The Holga went along for many of the trips.  The 35mm camp was pretty straightforward - Nikon FM3a, with a spare Nikon FM body, in case I needed it. For lenses I brought the 50mm f/1.4, 28mm f/2.8, 85mm f/2, 105mm Micro-Nikkor, 35-105 Nikkor zoom, and the Lensbaby Pro Optic 35. I added the Horizon 202, and shot about half a roll of film with it. The Yashica Electro 35 CC was a constant companion,  and I also brought along two 35mm toy cameras to round things out.  The only digital camera aside from my iPhone was the Lumix DMC-LX3, which I did use a bit.  Overall, I shot 8 rolls of 120 and 16 rolls of 35mm over the course of a week. That's a lot of medium format for me to shoot, and I used the 55mm lens on the P67 quite a bit.  Most of the film was b&w, but there was enough color to keep things interesting.  I'll start developing the film this weekend, and I am looking forward to sharing the results.  I'll be in Pittsburg at the end of the month, and look forward to photographing there again.some work aheadAll of the images shown in this post were made with my iPhone XR."},
{"title": "The KEKS 30mm f/10 body cap lens", "date": "Tuesday, April 06, 2021", "text": "KEKS Camera is a Taiwan-based company that produces the KEKS light meter, an attractive shoe-mounted light meter that's been getting some attention online. I was checking out their website, and saw something else that I figured would be a neat little item - a body cap with a 30mm f/10 lens mounted in it for $30. So, I place my order on March 18, and the package (envelope) arrived yesterday, April 5.   I'm sure that you are now wondering what the heck I'm talking about.What is the KEKS body cap lens?Typically, I have seen body caps turned into pinhole lens mounts for SLR cameras. That's pretty easy as a DIY project, and of course, there are commercially-made ones available. There are also pancake lenses that are very thin, made for M 4/3 cameras in the digital realm. The KEKS body cap lens is neither of these. It's an actual body cap with a 30mm f/10 lens from a Kodak single-use camera at the center.  There is no adjustment of any sort  except the shutter speed of the camera. The lens focuses from about 3 feet to infinity, and as you should expect from a single-use camera, the center is fairly sharp, while the outer edges of the frame are out of focus.   The idea is pretty good -- and because the distance to the film plane is shorter than with an SLR, the body cap lens is sold in only 4 mounts - Leica L39 thread, Leica M bayonet, Fujifilm X (digital) and Sony E (digital).  I bought the Leica Thread Mount (LTM), as it would fit my Zorki and my Canon 7 rangefinders.As you can see, there isn't much to this lens, but I thought it would be something fun to play with.  The shallow profile makes the camera seem quite svelte.  I mounted the lens on my Zorki 2c, and loaded a roll of Fomapan 100.   Since the aperture is fixed at f/10, I shot at 1/250 sec in full sun, and adjusted accordingly in other conditions.   I just estimated the exposures and didn't bother with a light meter, as I strolled around in Montreat, NC, which is near Black Mountain.  As this lens makes the camera basically a point-and-shoot, I didn't worry too much about the framing on the Zorki.  I probably could have put a wide-angle optical viewfinder on the cold-shoe, since the tiny Zorki viewfinder isn't much help.The KEKS lens in the Zorki 2cI developed the roll of Fomapan 100 in D76 for 7 minutes last night, and scanned the negs this morning on my Epson V700.  Once I looked at the scans, I could easily see that the lens performed pretty much as I expected - relatively sharp and contrasty in the center, with the image becoming progressively softer towards the edges.  Not a bad look for the way I shoot, but if one is expecting sharpness all around, this $30 gadget is not for you. Here are some results from yesterday's shooting."},

The adapters to fit a 35mm cassette into the 120 roll film spot work very well.  The panorama viewfinder mask fit over the ground glass, but I think it's a 1/2mm too thick, as the prism doesn't snug in tightly with it in place.  Second, the 35mm adaptor to go over the film gate doesn't really fit well, and wanted to rub against the shutter curtain so I decided not to use it, and expose the entire width of the film. The back of the Pentax 67 opened up, showing the supplyand take-up cassettes, and the taped-on leader.You need to set the film to 220 on the Pentax 6x7 pressure plate as well as the 120/220 selector button on the right side of the body.  To make sure that I got as much out of the 36 exposure roll, I taped a length of exposed 35mm film to the end of the fresh roll that was connected to the take-up cassette.  The take-up spool is an empty cassette (obviously oriented upside down. As it turns out, I need to make the leader a bit longer, as there was a length of unexposed film at the beginning of my roll.  The 220 setting is necessary if you are using a 36 exposure roll, and you should get close to 19 shots, unless you respool your own film and make it a 40-exposure roll.  The beauty of using this without the panoramic mask in the film gate is that I get 24x70mm negatives, excluding the sprockets.  If you are sprocket freak, then you'll appreciate the exposed sprocket area. Compared with my Horizon 202 (more about that in another post), it's a bit wider - 12mm. I used the Pentax 55mm lens on the 6x7, which is about equal to 28mm in 35mm. The Horizon 202's lens is also 28mm, but the crop with 6x7 55mm lens  results in an image without any distortion that one sees with the Horizon camera.  The obvious drawback with this setup is that the film still has some exposed frames that will be ruined if you open the back in daylight, unless you forgo shooting to the end of the roll.  I brought my camera back home and opened it up in my bathroom/darkroom and rewound the film into the original cassette.  I shot a roll of Ultrafine Extreme 100 and developed in D-96.  To say that I was happy with the images is an understatement.  All of my shots were handheld. The D-96 came from the FPP store.  All of my frames were scanned on my Epson V700 scanner.Some results.Dillsboro, NCDillsboro, NCRt. 197 up Ivy Knob to Cockscomb Mtn.The French Broad River at Ledges Whitewater ParkAfter I scanned in the negatives, I was pleased at how big those images could be viewed. Zooming in revealed a lot of detail, and a print from them would be quite striking.  You may ask why not just crop any 6x7 negative post scan to be a 24x70mm negative, and my answer is:You can no longer buy 220 film that is freshThere are so many more emulsions in 35mmThe viewfinder mask defines your image areaIt's part of the processIn part III of this series, I will discuss my experiences with my Horizon cameras."},
{"title": " What's with the Kodak M35?", "date": "Monday, March 22, 2021", "text": "If you have been trawling ebay for a bit, you might have come across a bunch of colorful, reusable 35mm cameras under the name Kodak M35.  Now, I know they are cheap little plastic cameras, but why aren't they available in the USA?  There are plenty of eBay sellers - all from China, Taiwan, or Korea, with prices ranging from nearly $30 to quite a bit more, as if these were some sort of collectible.  I searched US sellers, and although B&H have them listed for sale, there are no photos of the product, and their site says expected delivery in 7-14 days, but at $25.00 each.Now, with the Dubble Film Show and the Harman 35, I certainly don't really need another camera in that same class, but I would like to test one out, as I am prepping for a 35mm toy camera issue of Monochrome Mania.  The Kodak M35 looks very similar to the Dubble Film and Harman products, and yeah, there's only so many ways one can manufacture a cheap plastic camera that is barely a step-up from a one-time use camera.  What surprises me most is that these camera have Kodak branding, yet not a peep from Kodak in the US about selling/marketing them.  They are colorful, and sure to attract young buyers, so I have to wonder why there has  not been anything about them from Kodak or Kodak/Alaris. Are they testing the waters elsewhere before they sell in the US?  I don't expect anything better than what I have gotten from the Dubble Show or Harman 35, but at $25, they would be an attractive alternative, and priced right. Of course they are probably worth $10, but that's where we are these days with new film cameras, no matter how low-tech they may be.Some digging in the Web led me to Sino Promise Group in Hong Kong, which proclaims itself as the largest distributor of Kodak/Alaris products in the world, and THAT's where I found the Kodak information about the M35 and the M38 cameras. Here's the key bit of information at the bottom of the page about the M35: \"Sino Promise Group LTD. manufactures and sells the above film cameras. The Kodak trademark, logo and trade dress are used under license by Sino Promise Group LTD. Products are not available in all countries.\"  Indeed, they appear to be marketed in China, Philippines, Thailand, etc. Specs are pretty much the same as the Dubble Film and Harman 35 camerasSo, there you have it.  Sino Promise Group makes these under license from Kodak, and markets them, not Kodak.  Maybe we will eventually see them sold here in a variety of stores, but they were introduced in 2020, and the M38 model looks a lot more like the Dubble/Harman cameras.  I bet they are all made in the same factory - perhaps Great Wall?   Keep your eyes open for them to appear somewhere in the US at a retailer... or a flea market.UPDATE - JULY 27, 2021.I was at the Film Photography Project HQ last week, and Mike Raso has one of these cameras. I was able to inspect it, and it's EXACTLY the same camera as the Harman Reusable Camera.  The only thing that's different is the color of the front part of the camera, and the branding.  Given that the Harman camera comes with 2 rolls of Kentmere 400, it's a better deal"},
{"title": "Exploring ECN-2 Films", "date": "Wednesday, March 17, 2021", "text": "Over the past decade, as color film (C-41 and E-6) choices became more limited, I have seen a lot more attention paid to those cinema film emulsions offered by Kodak and Fujifilm. Yes, we still-film shooters have been putting cine-film in our cameras for quite a while. If you have used Kodak Double-X or Eastman 5222 film, it's a b&w ISO 200 negative film made for cinema.  At one time, the only way to get small quantities of it was to buy the unused \"film ends\" from an outfit in New York. Small quantities typically were about 70-200 ft, and the price was pretty cheap. As more people started using it, it became popular enough for resellers (such as the FPP, Cinestill, and Ultrafine) to buy the big reels of fresh 5222 and re-spool into 35mm cassettes and market them. I still don't understand why Kodak has not offered the 5222 as a still film. It's an excellent b&w emulsion with great latitude and is very pushable. There are other b&w emulsions that are made for cine use, but that's another story. Note that the C-41 still film has rectangular sprockets, while cine-films have rounded sprocket ends. The same holds true for B&W cine-films vs. still camera films.However, cinema color films are what this post is about. The use of color cine film in 35mm cameras goes back into the late 1970s, when Seattle Film Works sold their cheap color negative film that “only they could process.” Touted as the SWF-XL process, it was actually ECN-2, which uses slightly different chemicals than C-41, and also involved the removal of the black remjet layer (more about this later). The film was surplus cine film stock, and could have been made by several companies, as we were not told anything other than it was Seattle Film Works film, ISO 400 or 200. Due to the remjet coating, ordinary photo labs would not accept the film, because it would contaminate their chemistry. I'll link here to the Wikipedia article on SFW, and you can read more about their business and its demise.  I did use SFW in the mid-90s for a while, and they offered both prints and slides from the same roll of film. The slides were not very good, as they were copied from the negatives, and faded after about 10 years.  Lesson learned.  However, properly exposed fresh SFW film produced excellent negatives.  Don't judge a film from 30-year rolls that sat who knows where. The FPP has a podcast episode that discusses the SFW film.A bunch of expired SFW films. Image by Michael Raso, 2021So, you found some old rolls of the Seattle Film Works in a box? Who knows how they have been stored for the past 30+ years?  I'd say use the film for testing if a camera is advancing the film properly. Yes, you could develop them in the home-brew ECN-2, but why waste your time?  If you do decide to shoot them, rate at ISO 50 and maybe you'll get something.  With any long-expired color film, you will get color shifts and loss of sensitivity. Be aware that by the mid-1990s, Seattle Film Works switched to regular C-41 films (and still with the SFW-XL process on the label), and if they have Photoworks labeling, then they are definitely C-41, and not ECN-2. So, at minimum, the film will be 20 years old. You can probably get a good idea of what type of film you find in those SFW cassettes merely by looking at the sprockets.  ECN-2 films are cine-films and their sprocket holes are rounded, whereas C-41 films have rectangular sprocket holes. Also, if the cassettes are labeled as manufactured in Germany, they are most likely Agfa C-41 films.NEW INFO!  - (04/21/21) I just found a packet of information dated 1987 from SFW that lists the films.  They are as follows - SFW 6231 - 100 ASA - European (Agfa?)SFW 6251 - 200 ASA - European (Agfa?)SFW 5247 - 200 ASA - Eastman Kodak Motion Picture FilmSFW 6271 - 400 ASA - European (Agfa?)SFW 5294 - 640 ASA - Eastman Kodak Motion Picture FilmWhat's the big deal about color cine films?Kodak is the only producer of color cine-films, and many movies in the past several decades have been made on their Vision3 (https://www.kodak.com/en/motion/products/camera-films) series of films.  The big deal is that these films have good latitude, excellent color rendering, are optimized for particular types of lighting, and are available in ISO ratings of 50-500. Fujifilm produced its Eterna line of cine- films, which are now discontinued, like so much of Fujifilms' analog business. The big problem with any of these cine ECN-2 films is that all have a remjet layer on the base side of the film. The remjet coating protects the film against light-piping, halation, and static buildup on the film as it moves through the cine camera. Kodachrome also had a remjet layer, and it was both a cine and a still film. The remjet is mostly carbon, and if you process the film without removing it, you'll have an awful mess in your chemistry and the film won't look so great, either.  Commercial cine film labs have machines with 30 PSI water nozzles and roller-like scrubbers that remove the remjet before it gets run through the developing process, and there are also chemicals involved that introduce a mild base that dissolves the bonding agents in the remjet, making its removal easier.  So, while there are some fantastic color cine-films that could be shot with still cameras, you can't just reload them into a 35mm film cassette and then take them to a C-41 lab.  If you relabel the film as C-41 and it gets processed, you will be persona non grata forever for ruining their chemistry and contaminating their processor with carbon residue.  DON'T DO THAT!  You can develop the film at home, or send to a lab (listed below) that will handle ECN-2 films.MAIL-ORDER LABS THAT WILL ACCEPT ECN-2 FILM:BLUE MOON CAMERA & MACHINE -https://www.bluemooncamera.comTHE CAMERA SHOP - http://www.thecamerashop.com/OLD SCHOOL PHOTO LAB - https://oldschoolphotolab.com/BOUTIQUE PHOTO LAB - https://boutiquefilmlab.com/IMPORTANTThe removal of the remjet is actually fairly simple, and doing this method as a \"pre-wash\" before any developing will remove 99.9% of the remjet, with the remaining easily removed physically when you hang up the film to dry. Here's the procedure:Dissolve 1 heaping tablespoon of Sodium bicarbonate in 500ml of water at 100°F (38°C).  Pour into the developing tank with the film inside. Start shaking the tank vigorously (like a cocktail shaker), and be prepared to \"burp\" the gas escaping every few seconds. Do this for about 30 seconds, and pour out the foamy black water. Refill the tank with water at the same temperature, and shake vigorously again for 30 sec.  Pour and repeat until the water that drains out is clear.  There may also be a tint in the wash water from the dyes in the film – it may be green, pinkish, yellow, or purple. Now, you can proceed with the developing process, either C-41 or ECN-2.  Many people have developed the color cine-film in C-41 with satisfactory results, and processed C-41 films in ECN-2 with good results. However, I think that because the color-cine film was designed for ECN-2 processing, that's the better option, if you can do it.ECN-2 kits have only recently become commercially  available for hobbyist development.  Previously, one had to sequester the chemicals necessary for the process and mix them.  Here are the ingredients that you will need if you wish to mix them yourself:ECN-2 Developer - to make 1 literSodium Carbonate - 25.6 gramsSodium Bicarbonate - 2.8 gramsSodium Sulfite - 2 gramsPotassium Bromide - 1.4 gramsCD3 Color Developer - 4 gramsECN-2 Bleach - to make 1 literPotassium Ferricyanide - 40 gramsPotassium Bromide - 29 gramsDissolve the mixtures for each in 800 ml of 110°F water and then add water to make 1 liter.  Label  the containers very distinctly, as you don't want to bleach your film before developing it!The ECN-2 development process is as follows:AFTER the Sodium bicarbonate pre-wash, 1. ECN-2 Developer for 3 min at 106°F 2. Stop using an acid stop bath or a water stop, for 1 minute (100°F)3. Wash using the Ilford method (which is pouring water into the tank and shaking for 30 seconds) (100°F)4. ECN-2 Bleach for 3 min at about 100°F5. Wash again, Ilford method (around 100°F)6. Fix using any fixer** for 5 min  (100°F)-(I keep a separate 1 liter of fixer just for this process, as I don't want to contaminate the fixer that I use for other films)7. Wash (Ilford method) 4 times (80°-100°F)Note that you should agitate the develop, bleach, and fix steps every 30 seconds for best results.8. Remove the film and hang to dry - I wipe down the back of the film with a Photowipe until there is no longer any carbon residue - usually 3 passes with the wipe.  DO NOT wipe the emulsion side.**To make 1 liter of non-hardening fixer, you’ll need the following:800 ml of water at 125°F240 grams Sodium Thiosulfate30 grams Sodium Sulfite Mix, and add water to make 1 liter.Using this method has produced excellent scans from the ECN-2 films that I have developed.  There is some disagreement among hobbyist practitioners about the use of the sodium bicarbonate pre-wash.  I have tried not using it, and using just water alone will not remove as much carbon, and I ended up with more remjet on the film to remove physically after development, and more crap in the developing chemicals (which were C-41). It makes sense to remove as much of the remjet as possible BEFORE development to reduce the contamination of your developing chemicals. The kit from Ultrafine includes a reusable alkaline pre-bath.SOURCES for ECN-2 Developing Kits:Film Photography Project: The FPP ECN-2 kit also includes a packet of fixer, which is a great addition. Conspiracy of Cartographers Etsy Store: Ultrafine Online:  This kit comes with a pre-bath to assist in removing the remjet, and very precise instructions. It’s the same Kodak recipe as given above, just like the FPP and CoC kits.Freestyle Photo:  I have not tried this kit. Cinestill sells a modified ECN-2 kit, but I have not tried it and cannot comment on its resultsColor (ECN-2) Cine Films I admit to not having tried all of the color cine-films that are available.  While you can find the Fujifilm examples for sale on ebay, be aware that these are discontinued films, and are not going to be fresh. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't try them, but be aware of the age factor.  In addition, many of these 35mm films may be available in 16mm, should you want to load your own 16mm still cameras, such as the Minolta 16. FUJIFILM F64D - A low-speed daylight balanced film with fine grain, high sharpness and saturated colors. ETERNA 500- This appears to be a high speed film suitable for Tungsten lighting.ETERNA 250D - A fine-grained daylight-balanced film with lovely, rich colors.REALA 500D - Contains Fujifilm's \"4th color layer\" There are other cine-films that were manufactured by Fujifilm, but since all are discontinued, I'll just refer you to to this chart.KODAKAll of the Vision3 films listed are in current production.VISION3 50D - The finest-grained color film by Kodak. While the 50D is a slow-speed film, it's great for most outdoors shooting, and of course, with a tripod, there's no problem for longer exposures.  I like the colors and the highlight detail, as well as the contrast. VISION3 250D - I love the look of this film.  It has such lovely color rendition and reminds me of Kodachrome.  It's fine-grained, and it's nothing like the old 35mm C-41 standby, Gold 200.  If Kodak could produce this film for still photographers (i.e., without remjet), it would be really popular.  I have only processed it with ECN-2, so I don't know how different the colors would be in C-41. VISION3 200T - I have not used this film. It's for Tungsten lighting, so indoors would be ideal, especially with incandescent bulbs.  However, if you are using color-temperature adjustable LED light panels, you should set them to 3200K to mimic the Tungsten lighting, which also applies to the 500T below. VISION3 500T -This is an excellent high-speed film that has good shadow detail, fine-grained, and looks great under Tungsten lighting.  Of course, you can use it in daylight with a No. 85 filter, or just shoot it and color correct the scans.  This is the same film that Cinestill sells as 800T. There is no native 800 ISO cine film.  In essence, Cinestill is telling you to push the film 2/3 of a stop, which is not a lot.  However, pushing the film higher may not result in the best results. I think that some people coming from digital to film see the higher speed ratings much as they see changing the ISO on a digital camera. However, if a film's native ISO is X, then the most reliable results as found by the manufacturer is at X, not X + 500.  So, proceed at your own risk, and be aware that your results may vary.other ECN-2 Kodak filmsEastman Kodak EXR 5244 is a color intermediate film sold by Ultrafine Online.  They list the ISO as 1.  The film was introduced in the 1990s, and is discontinued.  It’s reported to have saturated colors, and I have a roll that I have yet to shoot. With such a low ISO, it’s certainly going to be tripod city, and in lots of light.  The 1999 literature from Kodak states:“EASTMAN EXR Color Intermediate Film 2244 (35 mm and 65 mm ESTAR), 5244 (35 mm and 65 mm acetate), and 7244 (16 mm acetate) is intended for making color master positives from EASTMAN Color Negative Camera Films, and for making color duplicate negatives from those master positives. You can also use EASTMAN EXR Color Intermediate Film for preparing color duplicate negatives from black-and-white silver separation positives. It contains an integral mask similar to the mask in Eastman color negative films but is more red in color. It has excellent image structure, tonal scale, and reproduction contrast near unity when recommended printing and processing procedures are followed. It features micro-fine grain, high sharpness and high resolving power.”Certainly an interesting film to try out! You will find other expired ECN-2 EXR and Vision2 films if you trawl eBay and Etsy.  My Experience with ECN-2Shooting with these films certainly gives me more emulsions to try out, and I have not been disappointed in my results, whether they were processed in C-41 or ECN-2 chemistry.  I recently tried a roll of the Fujifilm F64D that I rated at ISO 50.  The results were fantastic, as the examples will show.  It's very fine-grained, and the colors pop.  I also acquired some rolls of the Fujifilm ETERNA 250D,  and it too, has wonderful color. The remjet of the Eterna 250D comes off much quicker than the Kodak films, and I do not suggest putting a normal C-41 film together into the same developing tank if you are developing  multiple rolls in one tank.  My result ended up with lots of carbon on the C-41 emulsion, making it look like a snowstorm on the scans. I want to reiterate that the Fujifilm cine stocks are now only available via eBay and Etsy sellers, and are not in current production.The Kodak Vision3 films are beautiful, with excellent colors, and it's a shame that Kodak doesn't make them available as still films.  You can buy any of them from the Film Photography Project Store in 24 exposure rolls and 100 ft spools..  Cinestill sells the 50D and 800T (really 500T) Vision3 films in 36 exposure rolls, but the remjet has been removed, so they can be processed by any lab.  That alone makes them quite desirable for those wanting to use a local film lab. The two Cinestill-branded films are also available in 120, which is a nice option. Ultrafine Online also sells fresh Vision3 films and some of the expired ECN-2 films, including 100 ft rolls. So long as you home-process the films or send to a lab that will take ECN-2 films, these color cine film stocks offer more avenues to explore. My ECN-2 developing kits came from three sources – a home-brew kit from August Kelm five years ago, and my recent kits are from Conspiracy of Cartographers on Etsy, and a kit from Ultrafine.  The kits are based on the Kodak formulas. Some of my ECN-2 film was developed in the FPP C-41 1-liter kit, and I will indicate the developing chemistry in the image descriptions.  I also recommend that you use the Kodak-based ECN-2 kits  soon after mixing, as they may not have the shelf-life of mixed C-41 chemistry. My experience is that after a month, the films that go through the process are underdeveloped with “thin negatives”.  However, they did scan in pretty well with adjustments in the scans. The ECN-2 kits should yield 10 - 12 rolls per liter of chemistry, if used within 1 month.  It’s definitely cheaper than sending your film out to a lab!  Vision3 50D ExamplesMarquette, 2016, Nikon FG, dev. in C-41Ann Arbor, 2016, Nikon FG, dev. in C-41Ann Arbor, 2016, Nikon FG, dev. in C-41Ann Arbor, 2019, Yashica FX-7, dev. in ECN-2Asheville, 2020, Nikon N80, dev. in ECN-2Ann Arbor, 2019, Yashica FX-7, dev. in ECN-2Vision3 250DChimney Rock, 2021, Canon 7, dev. in ECN-2Asheville, 2021, Canon 7, dev. in ECN-2Asheville, 2021, Canon 7, dev. in ECN-2Pittsburgh, 2018, Nikon FM, ECN-2 dev.Pittsburgh, 2018, Nikon FM, ECN-2 dev.Weaverville, 2021, Nikkormat FT2, ECN-2 dev.Vision3 500TMansfield, OH, 2017, Pentax K1000, ECN-2 dev.New Jersey, 2019 Canon T-60, ECN-2 dev.Ann Arbor, 2017, Pentax K1000, ECN-2Toledo Zoo, 2017, Pentax K1000, ECN-2Fujifilm F64DAsheville, 2019, Ricoh XR-M, ECN-2 dev.Asheville, 2019, Ricoh XR-M, ECN-2 dev.Fujifilm Eterna 250DDillsboro, NC, 2021, Spotmatic F, ECN-2 dev.Biltmore, 2021, Spotmatic F, ECN-2 dev.Burnsville, NC, 2021, Spotmatic F, ECN-2 dev.Burnsville, NC, 2021, Spotmatic F, ECN-2 dev.The minuses of working with ECN-2 filmsFirst and foremost is the remjet issue.  You need to completely remove all traces from the back of the film, otherwise, you'll see white areas or spots on your scans.  You may only notice the residue after scanning.  I find it easy to lay the strip of film emulsion side down on the LED light pad and then use a dry microfiber cloth or Photowipe to remove the remaining carbon residue on the base of the film.  It's easy to fix a few spots with a healing or cloning tool in your editing software, but large areas will show up as white blotches unless you have done a thorough job of remjet removal. Here is a good example of a bad job of remjet removal:Second is not contaminating your chemistry.  Let's say that you want to develop some C-41 films in the ECN-2 chemistry.  You really want to reduce the number of free carbon particles in your chemistry, so an alkaline pre-bath of your ECN-2 films will drastically reduce the amount of gunk that ends up in your chemistry.  So, yeah, remjet is still the thing.  If you only use the chemistry for ECN-2 or only C-41 films, it will probably be less of a problem. I developed a roll of the Eterna 250D  and a roll of Kodak Color Plus 200 (C-41 film) together in aged ECN-2 chemistry.  Not only were the negatives thin, but the Kodak 200 had picked up carbon from the Fujifilm 250D remjet. It looks like a snowstorm on the scan - and almost like an effect you would pay extra for.look at all the white spots.  Kodak Color Plus 200.However, despite these little problems, I remain enthused about the ECN-2 films. The colors are glorious, and the fine-grained emulsions have no peer in C-41 films. Definitely give them a try.  The FPP Store and Ultrafine Online are the best places to get your hands on these films as well as the developing kits."},

It was titled \"Phase Change\" and the images were of various facets of the phases of water from liquid to solid and back again along Fleming Creek and the Huron River.  Many of those images appear in the zine, along with others taken after that show.  This issue departs from what I had previously done in the sense that I don't tell you about the cameras and films that I used, because I want the reader to enjoy the images for what they are.  Included are some quotes and poetry as well as information at the end about photographing in cold weather.  My friend Susan Patrice suggested some better fonts, and they have made a difference in the presentation.  Everyone that's seen the pre-press copy has really liked this issue, and I hope that you'll be tempted to purchase it and enjoy it, too.Monochrome Mania # 4 is once again  36 pages plus covers, and priced at $12 within the USA.  For readers in Canada, It's $15, and overseas, $18.

These one-roll reviews are sort of a preliminary report of what I hope to be more thorough testing.Adox HR-50 is certainly a film that should be of interest to black and white enthusiasts.  According to the Adox literature, the film is \"based on an emulsion commonly available for technical purposes, featuring an ultrafine grain and superpanchromatical sensitization.\"  I like that term \"superpanchromatical\"  I am going to have to use it sometimes and say, \"Wow! Superpanchromatical, Dude!\"HR-50 Spectral ResponseIn addition,  Adox  states \"ADOX HR-50 is especially suitable for street and landscape photography. In Portrait photography we recomend our dedicated HR-50 developer.ADOX modifies this film from the master roll and finishes it to 35mm, 120 and sheets (4×5). The film´s speed is enhanced to 50 ASA using ADOX´s new SPEED BOOST- technology. The gamma is reduced so it becomes perfectly usable for pictorial photography in regular developers. ADOX HR-50 can be used as an Infrared film and responds extremely well to any sort of filtration (yellow, orange, red, blue, green).\"Fact sheet - https://www.fotoimpex.com/shop/images/products/media/63360_5_PDF-Datasheet.pdfFilm facts:Emulsion: SuperpanchromaticalResolution: Up to 280 lp/mm at an image contrast of 1000:1ISO: 50/17°Base: 0.1mm PETAnti Halation: Combined AHU with NC/AH on backside* ( AHU=Anti-Halation Underlayer, NC=No Curling, AH=Anti-Halation)I purchased two rolls of the HR-50 and a bottle of its special developer from B&H. Usually, I try to stick to developers that I commonly use, but in this instance, it seems that the HR Developer gives the best results. In developing a roll of the HR-50 in a single reel tank, I needed only 6 ml of developer and 294 of water.  I shot the first roll in November of 2020 and Feb. 2021 in my Pentax Spotmatic F. No filters were used. I plan on using roll 2 during the summer with a 25A red filter to see what I get with green vegetation on a sunny day.This film reminds me a great deal of Kodak's Technical Pan Film. The clear PET base makes scanning really easy, and the spectral response is similar to TechPan, which is sensitive into the near-IR end of the spectrum. The HR developer reminds me a bit of the Kodak Technidol liquid, but I have no idea what the HR-formula contains. I sense that the HR-50 film would be a high-contrast film if developed with anything other than the HR Developer, much like Tech Pan.  This film is really sharp and virtually grainless, and I found that in shaded conditions, there is a really smooth tonality.  In stark sunlit conditions, the highlights appear somewhat overexposed, and shadows dark. That could be due to my processing or my metering, but I do like the look of this film. Midtones, do look pretty good, though.  I think that if you are looking for a pictorial replacement for Tech Pan, the Adox HR-50 should be a great candidate.  The preliminary results from it certainly encourage me to do more testing. It's a faster film than Tech Pan, for sure.  I may also try developing some in POTA, just to see how it compares, and likewise, I will try developing some Tech Pan (I still have a lot of it) in the HR Developer and see what I get from that.As of this writing (3-5-2021),  it appears that HR-50 is no longer offered through US retailers, though I see it for sale in the EU. Drat!  Now I wish that I had bought more of this nice film.Some Examples:From the Blue Ridge Parkway, November 2020dying elephant-ear leavesThese are all from a visit to Dillsboro, NC in late February, 2021.Dillsboro, NC RR crossing. Restful place on the other side of the tracksWe sell masksAll others pay cashmirror viewRails, roads, and mountains"},
{"title": "Spotmatic II - SP II Joy", "date": "Tuesday, March 02, 2021", "text": "Out and About With A Spotmatic IIThe SP III have always loved Pentax Spotmatic SLRs.  I was able to borrow one in college (late 1970s) which I used on a research trip to the SW in 1980, and before that, used it with extension tubes to shoot macro of the wasps that I was working with for my thesis.  My own SLR at the time was an Exakta Exa 1a which lacked so many features that the Spotmatic had.  By the time I was working and needed to buy a new SLR, I bought a Pentax MG, which is pretty much the same camera as the Pentax ME.  Had I thought about it, I should have purchased a used Spotmatic F or Spotmatic II, which although they were M-42 mount bodies, were superior to the MG in build and had match-needle metering.This Spotmatic II (SP II) came to me recently to sell, and it is in wonderful condition.  So good, I should have bought it for myself, but I already have the better camera in the Spotmatic F.  The Spotmatic F features open-aperture metering with SMC-Takumar lenses, whereas the SP II still uses stop-down metering.  Not really a big deal, but I do like the open-aperture metering.  I decided to test the camera out and shot a roll of the FPP 200 BW film - now known as FPP LOVE BW.  First of all, the SP II was produced from 1971-1977, and based on the serial number of this one (5407261), it was probably made between 1971-73.  So, it's about 50 years old.It is in excellent condition. I have seen very few Spotmatics that look as minty as this one, which is probably because it was kept in a never-ready case. The SP II is as elegant and as simple in operation as metal-bodied SLR can get Everything about it seems precise and ergonomically correct. The shutter is fairly quiet, and advancing the film is easily done.  The camera came with the typical 55mm f/1.8 Super Multi-Coated Takumar (SMC Tak), which is a great lens, and one of the best in the M-42 mount.A thing of beautyI took the camera around the River Arts District in Asheville, and also on a short trip into Pisgah national Forest near Barnardsville, NC. I also had my Spotmatic F along loaded with color film.  I processed the FPP 200 in D-96 for 8 minutes.  The results were pretty much as I expected. The meter works well, and for a 50-year old SLR, it works as good as it did on the sday it was made. Not too big of a surprise, really, but the camera confirmed why I like Spotmatics.  They are great to work with, and while some people don't like the screw-mount lens system, I don't feel it ever hindered me.Of course, there are other places on the web with far more information on Spotmatics than I am going to give here, Casual Photophile's blog is a good place to start, and the Camera Wiki has more information.  I just don't understand how the Pentax K1000 gets all the attention, while the more refined Spotmatic F is a far better body. Pricewise, you can pick up the SP II for less than $50, and M-42 lenses are similarly inexpensive.  A few images:"},
{"title": "Widening Your Horizon", "date": "Thursday, February 18, 2021", "text": "Vance Birthplace, Reems Creek, NC 2019. Sprocket Rocket, Fuji Superia 400One of the important aspects of photography is determining how much of a scene will appear in your image. Not only that, but the aspect ratio in which the scene was recorded (whether film or digital), is also an important decision.  We often see different aspect ratios available on digital cameras - 1:1 (square) 3:2, 4:3, 16:9, etc.  With film, the original aspect ratio of the medium is square 1:1 (24x24 mm for 35 mm, or 6x6 cm in 120), 2x3 (24 x 36mm for 35mm) 3x4 (18 x 24 mm in 35mm half-frame), and in medium format, 6x4.5, 6x7, 6x8, 6x9, and 6 x 17. Large format of course, is 4x5, 5x7, 8x10, etc., but not a part of this discussion.  I only mention digital here because you can choose a wider aspect ratio in-camera, but at the cost of pixels. Panoramic format is generally considered to be about twice as wide as high, so an aspect ratio of 16:9 is pretty close in the digital world. I'm going to discuss 35mm film formats, since that's the most-often used film, and the panoramic options are more affordable.  To get more of a landscape in your image, one can go the wide-angle route, using lenses with short focal lengths such as 28mm down to 16mm.  My favorite wide focal length is 24mm, because it's not so wide that there is going to be major distortion in perspective, compared to 19mm or 20mm.  However, the problem with just using a wide-angle lens is that all of the scene, from sky to foreground is there, unless you crop it out.  The better solution to a wide-scape is to use a wider frame of film for the scene.While a standard 35mm still negative image area is 24 x 36 mm, there are other formats that will affect the area of the scene captured.  You may often hear about panoramic format images from 35mm and the typical, easy way to do that is simply to mask a 35mm frame so that it ends up with the negative area that is about 15mm high x 36mm wide.  There are many 35mm point and shoots and a few SLRs that do this trick by using a horizontal mask at the top and bottom of the frame. It works quite well, but the downside is that you have also lost some resolution, as you are cropping the 35mm frame to a much smaller area.  Making enlargements will often be grainier and less sharp. However, with a wide-angle lens and a good exposure on fine-grained film, the result can be quite acceptable.   Lake Michigan Dunes, 2007. Ansco Pix Panorama, Delta 400 filmThe better way to present a wider-aspect ratio image is to increase the frame size. To do this, the camera needs to have a wider film gate, and a lens that will work with the wider image circle. There are several options for this, and most of them are expensive. The one camera that's probably most coveted for wide shots is the Hasselblad X-Pan (made by Fujifilm, and also known as the Fujifilm TX-1). The negative area for that camera is 24 x 65mm, almost double the frame width of a typical 35mm.  The price of such a camera now is beyond the means for most of us. So, what other choices are there?  Well, fear not.  My list that follows are low-cost solutions to the panoramic problem.Ansco Pix Panorama The low-fi way to do it.The removeable panoramic mask in the cameraThis is the low-fi, low-cost way to shoot a cropped frame panoramic. Amazingly enough, the images are better than one might expect. They have the toy camera aesthetic, and with the 27mm lens, one gets a true wide-angle for the best result with the cropped 13x36mm negative.  The shutter speed is about 1/125 sec, with an F/11 aperture.  The panorama mask is removeable so that you can also get standard 24x36mm negatives.   Ebay prices are quite low, ranging from $5 to $20.  Ansco Pix Panorama  cameras are quite common (not made by Ansco, but by Haking in China), so don't overpay for one.  Due their easily pocketable size, they provide a fun and easy way to get a panoramic look.  On sunny days, ISO 100 films should be just fine, otherwise ISO 200 or 400 films.  Kodak's Tmax 100 for b&w would be a good choice for sunny conditions. There are many other 35mm cameras with a panorama mask and wide-angle lens, such as the Ricoh R1, Minolta Freedom Vista, Olympus Trip Panorama, Yashica Microtek Zoom 70,  Nikon Lite Touch AF 600, Vivitar IC101, Vivitar T200, Vivitar PN 2011, Pentax UC-1, etc. Lower harbor, Marquette, MI. 2014. Yashica Microtek Zoom 70. Konica VX 400 film.Curvilinear, 2013. Nikon F-50D with the pano mask, Tmax 100 filmLomography Sprocket RocketLomography's Sprocket Rocket is a great plastic fantastic panoramic camera, which I discussed in 2017.   The Sprocket Rocket's real frame size is actually wider than the X-Pan, at 24 x 72mm, or two full 35mm frames.   With its 30mm f/11 and f/16 lens and only Instant (1/100) and B shutter speeds, it's limited in the ways that an X-Pan is not.  However, it does have a tripod socket, so lengthy exposures are possible.  Best of all, it's an easy to carry-around camera that takes pretty darn good images. There's some vignetting, some blurred edges, and a bit of distortion, but I love the images that I get from this camera.  I do not care about showing the sprockets, and they are cropped in my scanner frame, anyway.  With a 36 exposure roll of film, you will get about 16 shots.   I have found that using 200-400 ISO film works great in most conditions.  My favorite film to use with this camera is Eastman 5222 (Double-X).  Cloudgate, Chicago, 2017. Sprocket Rocket, Eastman 5222Holga 135 PanThe Holga 135 Pan looks much like an elongated  Holga 120N.  It has a removable 55mm f/8 lens plus an f/236 pinhole lens.  The frame size is 24 x 72 mm - again, a tad wider than the X-Pan. It's zone focus, and has two shutter speeds - ca. 1/100 sec and Bulb.  It also has a tripod socket and a hot shoe for flash.  I have used mine as a pinhole camera and also with the regular lens, and I prefer the 55mm lens. I reviewed the camera back in 2012.  I don't think the images are as sharp as the Sprocket Rocket, which is due to the Holga lens. However, if you want to shoot wide with a toy camera, it's one to consider, and it's definitely given me some memorable images.Great Lakes Freighter, 2012. Holga 135 Pan, Superia 200Angell Hall, 2012. Holga 135 pan, Vista 100 filmHolga 120N 35mm AdapterI reviewed this solution in 2010, and the resulting frame size is 24 x 55 mm, because you are using the 35mm film in a 120 film body.  The biggest drawback in my opinion is the frame counting is tedious, and you can't rewind the film without taking the camera into a dark bag and unloading it.  You can also put 35mm in film other medium format cameras, and only a 6x9 format makes this desirable.  There are many hacks for doing this, but in most of the instances, you can't rewind the film in camera, which does make this method cumbersome.  In addition, the medium-format lenses are typicall \"normal\" and not wide, so the effect won't be quite the same as a panoramic camera.Result from the Holga 35mm adapter, 2010.Other Medium Format Camera Adapters -Using a 35mm adapter in a Pentax 6x7 ought to give nice results if you use it with a wide-angle lens such as the 45 or 55 mm lens. There are 3D printed adapters available online.  One photographer has blogged about his impressive results.  A Mamiya RB67  can also be modified to work with 35mm, and as with the Pentax 67, there are some online sources for a DIY or finished product.  Again, all of these adapters require you to rewind the film back into the cassette by using a dark bag or darkroom. If you already have a Pentax 6x7, then the adapter is a low-cost entry into 35mm panoramas. I plan on trying one out this year.Horizon Panoramic CameraHorizont (Horizon) 35mm swing-lens panoramic cameraThe other option is to use a swing-lens panoramic camera that does not distort the images the way toy cameras are prone to do. The Horizont cameras, manufactured by Krasnogorsky Mechanicheskiy Zavod (KMZ) in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), debuted in 1966, and use 35mm film with a 24 x 58 mm framze size.  KMZ is also known for its line of Zenit 35mm cameras.  The Horizont features an 28mm f/2.8 Industar lens and four shutter speeds, ranging from 1/30 to 1/250 sec. It was replaced by the Horizon 202 in 1989, and then by the Horizon S3Pro in 2003.  Lomography now sells the Horizon Perfekt, which has an ABS plastic body, easier controls, more streamlined shape, and is made in the Zenit factory.  Another model from Lomography is the Horizon Kompakt which has only 1 shutter speed and an f/8 aperture. A new Horizon Perfekt will set you back about $350, with the older models going for less.  The Horizont will give you sharp images, and is a heck of a lot cheaper than the Widelux or Noblex swing-lens panoramic cameras.    My Horizont arrived the other day from an eBay seller, and I am just testing it out now.To sum it all up, shooting a scene on a wider negative provides a much different view than a standard 35mm frame, even if a wide-angle lens is used.  You can of course, crop any image to get a wider aspect ratio, but cropping is at the loss of image area, whether film or pixels. A wider negative in panoramic format presents the viewer with a more dynamic depiction of a scene.Of course, you do not have to shoot panoramas horizontally.  Vertical shots are really fun, and provide a definite vertically dominant image.A triptych from 3 vertical Ansco Pix Panorama shots, 2007.About Medium Format PanoramasIf you want to really go with film real estate, you can choose among medium-format cameras, with 6x12 and 6x18 cm being very amazing, and also very expensive.  However, there are a number of people that have produced 6x12 cameras using 3D printing.  The Kraken 6x12 from Graham Young is a good example. This makes shooting wide in medium format much more accessible. Lomography's Belair also does 6x12 at a reasonable price, but my sample of the camera never seemed to focus accurately, and I really never warmed to to it.  Of course, there are Widelux and Noblex cameras that use 120, and are pricey.  The cheapest 6x12 would be the Holga 120 Pan that has a 90mm lens and the typical Holga construction.  However, it's probably no longer in production. On the higher end of the scale, Linhoff and Fujifilm have the extreme wide panoramic cameras with prices and image quality to match.    More Images!The wide-angle image from the Ansco Pix without thepanorama mask in place. 2008. April 2017 Festifools.

{"title": " It's About Time", "date": "Tuesday, February 02, 2021", "text": "The Phochron XA shutter tester and a Kodak DuexIn issue 3 of Monochrome Mania, I provided estimated shutter speeds for most of the cameras that I listed. At the time, I had not tested the speeds with my shutter tester - The Phochron  XA. I probably should have done so before publication, but it just didn't happen.  One of my readers asked me if I had checked the speeds or used the ones given in the literature. The ones provided in the various sources are what I used, because they are the benchmark numbers that provide a basis from which to work from.  I don't expect any of these cameras to have the same shutter speed across all examples.Today, I went and tested a number of my toy cameras. I repeated each shutter activation 6-10 times, and got an average speed.  The numbers listed below don't mean that every example of a camera will have the same speeds, but you can compare what I found with the published speeds and go from there. All shutter speeds from my test are given as the average.120 Cameras (Listed in the same order as in MM#3)The DianaDIANAFirst up is the mighty Diana, and the shutter speeds of the original versus the Lomography Diana + are definitely different.

These are not precision cameras, so do not expect precise shutter speeds.  My biggest surprise was with the Diana and Holga cameras. I did not expect the Holga speeds to be over 1/150 sec, nor did I think that the Diana+ examples would be so different.  However, as I have said before, the variance in performance of those cameras makes them ideal candidates for owning several, as they seem to have individual character."},
{"title": "Revisiting Themes", "date": "Monday, January 25, 2021", "text": "Right now, I am in the midst of doing more scanning and editing of images that I made over a decade ago.  As I have said before, it's an ongoing project.  However, I have been working specifically to find appropriate images for my next issue of Monochrome Mania No. 4, which will deal with winter photography.  In 2011, I had a pretty good show at Matthaei Botanical gardens with my \"Phase Change\" exhibit.  I had a pretty good selection of prints in 16x20 frames.  I didn't sell a single one.  That's not unusual for such shows that are in an atypical gallery space.  I still have a couple of them adorning my walls here in NC, as they are evidence of a winter that we don't typically see here.  Finding the old negatives was easy once I realized that I had put them in a binder devoted just to winter ice and snow images.  Scanning them in now and making adjustments brings back some memories, and also some observations:Kodak's Technical Pan film is perfect for this subjectPhotography on overcast days was the best, as the highlights didn't get blown out.I used manual cameras, such as the Nikon FM2A, F2S, and Canon FTb QL, and A1.  In doing so, I compensated the exposure by watching where the needle or LED was in overexposing.  Water and ice are fascinating subjects, and I think this next issue of Monochrome Mania will be worthy of the effort that I put in a decade ago.  I hope to have it ready by March."},
{"title": "New York, April 2004", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2021", "text": "As I have already mentioned on Random Camera Blog, I have been going back through my 20+ years of binders of negatives.  In looking for some specific rolls, I have been surprised at how few of the pre-2007 images have been seen.  Some of the scans will end up in future Monochrome Mania issues, but a lot will be sent up in Flickr and Instagram. Me, somewhere in Manhattan, April 2004. The photo vest was a back saver.In April, 2004, Adrienne and I drove to her parent's house in Amenia, New York (about 2 hours N of NYC).  Our daughter Jorie was on a charter bus to New York City with her fellow Huron High School Orchestra members to play at Carnegie Hall.  Adrienne's Mom accompanied  the two of us on the Amtrak to the Big Apple and met up with Jorie and her classmates.  Aside from the musical part of the trip, I wanted to photograph around Manhattan, as I had not been there since I was in High School in in 1973.  Gear-wise, I brought a Minolta X700 and three lenses (50mm, 28mm, and a 35-135 zoom), Contax G1 with the 45mm lens, Holga 120s, Lubitel 2, Zeiss Ikon 6x9 folder, and an Olympus XA.  I shot slide film and lots of Ilford b&w film - Kentmere 100, Pan-F, Delta 400, Delta 100, and HP-5.   It turns out that the X700's batteries had died, which i realized when we were in the Catskills on the way to Amenia.  I had to find a store that sold the button cells for my camera before i could use it, so that was a lesson learned.  Always bring extra batteries!  I certainly had plenty of film.We stayed at a hotel not far from Times Square in the \"Little Brazil\" neighborhood, and were within easy walking distance of most places.  Since we were there during Easter break, the photo stores that I most wanted to visit - B&H and Adorama - were closed for Passover. I did however, manage to visit Olden Camera, which I knew from its ads in past years. I was surprised to find it open, and I can only describe the store as shabby.  There were Argus C-3 cameras in a glass case priced at well over $50, lots of movie equipment, and not much that immediately caught my interest.  It seemed like more of a museum than a store.  Classic sign, but inside, it was past its primeIn April 2004, it was less than 3 years since the 9/11 attacks, and I recall how some security guard yelled at me for carrying a camera near the Federal Building, which was ringed with concrete barriers, creating an ugliness that was matched by the guard's attitude.  On one of the days, we walked the length of Broadway, all the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, and took the subway back.  I can't imagine a more amazing walk than that one, as we passed through so many different areas of the city.  I think the one thing that I took away from that walk was the diversity of people and architecture.  New York has been a Mecca for many photographers, and for good reasons.  I did take photos of the International Center of Photography, and we went in and toured the exhibits.  The Aperture HQ was also photographed.  Kodak had a big presence on Times Square, sort of a last hurrah of a the once giant company.  There were still lots of places we passed by that did 1 hour film development, as digital had not yet slayed them.  I think you can't avoid being a street photographer in New York. It's practically impossible. Every block in the city has a story to tell, and it changes daily.  With cell phone photographers everywhere, I think the nature of street photography has changed, as have attitudes about photographers. We had NYC pocket guides that helped us find our way, whereas now everything can be found via my iPhone.  I think in some ways, that ambling along and finding unexpected gems is more rewarding.   When I was 16, and visiting Manhattan, I walked everywhere, and once I realized I had the map orientation wrong, I found things much easier!  Times Square in 1973 was a morass of adult vices, and quite the eyeful for a teenager.  In 2004, Times Square was (and still is) more like Disneyland. No longer grungy, but everything shiny, bright, and loud.    Another big difference from 1973 was all of the easily found fast-food and coffee chains.  No more tawdry diners, but the same food that you can order in suburbia.  That's not to say there aren't a huge number of restaurants of all kinds, but I suspect that a McDonald's in Times Square is a bit reassuring to some tourists, especially those with kids.  None of that was there in the 70s.Jorie, at Central ParkCentral Park is the crowning jewel, in my opinion. No other large city has anything to compare to it.  There is so much there, I can see someone photographing there and nowhere else, and never getting tired of what Central Park offers. So, you can just imagine my delight in being there on a cool and sunny April day, walking around with my Minolta.  Frederick Law Olmsted designed a masterpiece park, which gets about 38 MILLION visitors annually.   I know we only walked around for  an hour or two, but it was amazing. I could have spent two days there.We were lucky to be there for the Easter Parade, and though it was a bit wet and chilly, the crowd outside St. Patricks' Cathedral was hatted up and the variety and extreme lengths people went for their \"bonnets\" was quite amusing.   One lady wore a large hat that one of her iguanas was hanging onto, with another one one her shoulder.  The New York Yankees Super-fan guy was impressive, as was the Queen of Hearts at 7 feet, or maybe it was the Heart of Queens.  Anyhow, it was a lot of fun to see people strutting their holiday headgear.Flat Iron Bldg., Zeiss-Ikon 6x9Ilford HP-5NY Public Library, Zeiss-Ikon 6x9Ilford HP-5Brooklyn Bridge, Lubitel 2, Tmax 100As I pore over the scans from those 3 days in New York, I realize that I did a pretty good job with composition, etc.  I used the 28mm quite a bit, which really is helpful when one has the tall buildings and street scenes of a large city.  The 50mm got quite a bit of use, as well.  Were I staying a few days now in the Big Apple, I'd most likely use my Nikon FM3a with a 24mm and the 50 mm f/1.8, and keep the 85mm f/2 in a pocket.  The second camera would probably be the Olympus Trip 35 or my Yashica 35CC with wacky color films.  If I were to be shooting medium format, I suppose I would choose the YashicaMat 124, since it has a built-in meter.I'm glad that I spent a couple of days going through those 2004 negatives and scanning them in. Some of them are very good photographs, and I'm glad that they were captured on film, because in 2004 they would have been fairly crappy digital images that I would probably have lost track of.  3 shots inside the Guggenheim.

{"title": " Some Good Thoughts On 2020", "date": "Wednesday, December 23, 2020", "text": "Obviously, this past year is one that does not need to be repeated. So many things that many of us had planned went down the drain with COVID-19 and the subsequent effects on our world.  On top of that, a country with a disinterested self-indulgent criminal and con-artist in the role of president only made things worse. Despite the assaults on the constitution and the fabric of our society, it took 80 million voters to say \"we have had enough.\"As I look back on 2020,  it's clear to me that while there are many things I did not do, my lifestyle was not severely impacted.  As a retiree, the daily routine was not interrupted. I did not have to worry about children in school, losing my job, working in fear of becoming sick, telecommuting, or traveling to work.  So, I consider myself very lucky in that way.  Sure, I miss being able to go to a brewery for a quick beer, hanging out with people, and shopping anywhere without having to wear a mask. However, those are not unbearable burdens, merely inconveniences.The things I could not do didn't prevent me from being creative. like many others, I found myself doing things that were more self-reflective or projects that had been put on hold for various reasons, became important.  New ways to do things allowed me to be \"social\" in a way that I had not done before, and establish new friendships via social media.  Before the pandemic hit us, Beverley, Adrienne, and I visited the pretty town of Sylva, where the movie Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri was filmed.  Another trip in late February saw Beverley and I visit Selby and Forest City, NC. There were some other trips to Brevard and Biltmore.  Looking back, who knew that by the first day of spring, the streets of Asheville would be nearly empty of people, and businesses shuttered?Instead of doing some long trips around NC and into some other states, I did a lot of day-trips.  One of my favorites was the day Adrienne and I drove up to Mt. Airy to witness the emergence of millions of periodical cicadas.  Although I had seen them in Ann Arbor, it was nothing like the scale of numbers that we saw that day. I am sure many thousands of cicadas were killed while flying across the interstate. The sound of their combined chorus was incredibly loud, too.   Another fun trip was the one to Linville Falls, where I met up with Joseph Brunjes. It was great to get together with another photographer and talk photography while we walked the trails.  Last year, Susan Patrice told me about Rocky Fork State Park in Tennessee. I made my first trip there in May of this year.  It's about a 30 minute drive from my house, and I made several more trips there throughout the year.  I rarely saw anyone else apart from people driving along the road.  It's a fantastic stream with lots of small falls and cascades that are seemingly never-ending, with lots of great photo ops.   Likewise, driving along the Blue Ridge Parkway is always a great way to spend a day.  It was a good time to just drive around and explore the countryside, which doesn't involve contact with other people.  I drove a lot of back roads and visited a number of small towns that were new to me.  So different than driving around flat Michigan.  I produced two issues of Monochrome Mania during the pandemic.  Issue 2 was about photographing on various trips around Michigan, and issue 3 is all about medium-format toy cameras.  Number three required a lot of work in acquiring cameras to test, shooting with them, researching the history of different models, and of course, going through my older work to choose some images for the magazine.  I ended up separating all my toy camera negatives and organizing them in binders. It will make any future work with them far easier.Going through my earlier work has been very productive and enlightening.  I have been scanning in a lot negatives that have not been scanned, and in the process found some images that I had forgotten about, and feel different about them now than when I made them.  Sometimes it's good to be removed from the immediate, emotional connection that comes with making a photo.  In doing so, I found some very good images, as well as some really awful ones.  I have also been winnowing out some of the boxes and boxes of 35mm color prints.  In retrospect, some are just not worth keeping. Many were made when I was just testing out cameras, and have lost their relevance.  Images of family, pets, and events are certainly wonderful to have, but not all are worth the space it takes to store them. I made some new friends due to Instagram, and my work with the Film Photography Project. In fact, Mike Raso's efforts to keep podcasting during the pandemic prompted him to try some new things like producing You Tube videos.  Using Zoom to record the podcast episodes was a lot of fun, and ALMOST as good as being there in person. Mike is a perfectionist in his production of the episodes, and the audio quality of internet interactions does not match what one gets in the studio with pro-grade mics and equipment.  Nonetheless, the podcasts and videos are really good.  I also got to listen to a lot of other podcasts this year, and my favorite podcast (after the FPP, of course!) is All Through A Lens podcast with Eric and Vania.  It's a great podcast that covers a myriad of topics, and has introduced me to some photographers' works that I'd never heard of before it was on the ATAL podcast.  Also, the banter between Vania and Eric is a lot of fun. Both are passionate photographers, and it shows in the attention they pay to processes and technique as well as just having fun doing what they love.Another bright spot this year was the continued popularity of film and the explosion of interest in 8mm film. I can't speak to the movie-making, as it's not my thing, but Mike tells me that the demand has been amazing.   As far as still-photography, there seems to be amped up interest in alt-processes as well as conventional ones.  While the digital world is having its battles with SLRs vs mirrorless, or full-frame vs cropped sensors, or Canon vs Nikon, we film users are happily shooting away with our various cameras, formats, and films, and it's all good.  The only controversies seem to be about the price increases from Kodak, and the dearth of home C-41 kits.   The film shooting community is filled with people that are passionate about their medium, and also filled with people that are helpful, generous, and very creative. Speaking of social media, I see that there is a lot of resentment of Instagram's policies regarding censorship of images. I know that photographers feel that their work should be shown without censorship, and I agree.  If your work is likely to be censored or removed for what IG feels violates \"community standards\" I suggest that you use Flickr.  Flickr remains the best place to share your work, and I have been using it since 2004. For me, it's an incredible way to archive my work, and at $50 year it is still a good deal.Those are a few thoughts on the year.  It was a memorable one, in ways that we could not have anticipated, and I hope, as everyone does, that 2021 will be an improved one.  Best wishes to you all for a Happy New Year, and get out there and take some pictures!"},
{"title": "Twenty Years of Photography", "date": "Saturday, December 19, 2020", "text": "Twenty years ago, I went from being a typical family snapshooter to learning all I could about photography, and to become a better photographer.  That quest has never ended -,and I am always learning new things, and how to be a better photographer.  Over the past week or so, I began looking through my binders of early negatives, where shooting with b&w film really began having an effect on the way I saw scenes, and of course, recorded them on film.  Prior to that, I was shooting mostly color print film and color slides - and while I continued to do color work, it was the b&w world where I was learning the most.  Learning how to compose and think in b&w, as well as all the developing of negatives and subsequent printing onto sliver-gelatin paper.  My subject matter changed, compared to what I was shooting in color.  For me, color was where I was shooting macro and close-ups, and I suppose that I was trying to emulate the work of nature photographer John Shaw. While I learned a lot from his books and videos (which are very good), it also coincided with my vocation as an entomologist, and aided my research and work on insects.  Bill Brudon, Nov. 2001. Praktica Super TL, Tri-X film.However, it was my mentor, William L. Brudon, that changed my world with his immense knowledge of black and white films and how to achieve the desired results with so many different kinds of b&w film. Bill was always testing different films with various developers, and he kept notebooks filled with his results. He was also a medical illustrator, natural science artist, and a good photographer. Bill and his wife Margaret (also a medical illustrator) lived a mile from my house, and every time I met with him, his critical eye and old-school demeanor whetted my appetite for more. He introduced me to the works of Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Walker Evans, Imogen Cunningham, Stieglitz, and Sudek, among others. His generous gifts of books and cameras and film are something that I shall never forget, and I swore to myself that I would repay him by sharing my knowledge and pass on film, books, and equipment to others when the opportunities arose. As my photography evolved, I did less macrophotography except in relation to work, and I explored b&w and different cameras in much of my free time. In late 2000, I developed my first roll of b&w film since I was in high school.  That whiff of stop bath and fixer immediately transported me to 1974. It was magic then, and it is still magic.  To see a roll of film yield images is forever a wonderful thing. I have developed thousands of rolls of film myself, and it never gets old.  My view, my images, my work, to make them something tangible. It's imagination, science, art, technology, and some craft makes those images possible.Fleming Creek, 12-25-2000. Nikon FE, Ilford Delta 100Bill Brudon was the person that changed me from being happy to get a picture from my camera, to someone wanting to show the world what I saw, and to always want to do better than the last roll I shot. To experience different film formats and see how they affected my composition and subject matter, to find that elusive moment when I know that BAM! I got the image that I envisioned, and to know that serendipity favors the prepared.  I have also learned that the quality of the gear means nothing without vision.  Some of my best images have been taken with my “worst” cameras.  Cobblestone Farm, June 2001.  Ricoh KR-5, 28mm lensand Kodak's High Speed Infrared film with a Red 25A filter. Bill introduced me to the world of IR film.Over the past 20 years, I have certainly handled more cameras (thousands) than I ever thought possible, due to an interest in collecting certain cameras (with an intense excursion into Argus, because I lived in Ann Arbor), and also because I became the person that could sell off a photographer’s estate.  That allowed me to learn an awful lot of photographic history and operate a lot of vintage cameras, some of which are rarely encountered. It put me in contact with many fine people in the Michigan Photographic Historical Society, of which I was a board member for a few years. Senescence. Nov. 2001, Nikkormat FT2, Kodak Tri-X.So, it's hard to believe that in 2000, I was 44 years old, and absorbing so much new information and embarking on this journey into photography.  I certainly did not anticipate that my wife and I would sell our house and buy Bill and Margaret's home when they decided to move to a retirement village in 2002, and that Bill would leave behind a complete darkroom setup for me in that house.  A lot of what I learned proved useful in my real job at the University of Michigan, especially macro-photography.  But macrophotography isn't what I kept doing with my photography, it was learning about this huge universe of photographic technology, the history of photography, the arcane things that you can only pick up by delving into the minutiae of photography.  On top of all of that, it was shoot, shoot, shoot.  As I look over my negatives from 2000-2002, I can see that I often bracketed a lot of shots, as I was unsure of how things were best exposed. Bill also made sure that I did bracket so that I could judge a series of negatives for the best overall exposure. I really enjoyed delving into trying various films and developers, and as I look over those early negatives, I can see now where I should have done something differently had I known at the time. It's not hindsight - it's learning.  Some proof sheets and negatives from 2001I started this blog in late 2004, and it's been an ongoing way for me to share my photography, thoughts, and reviews of cameras and film.  That I have been doing it for 16 years astonishes me.  Huron River, Sept. 2000, Retinette 1a, Agfa APX 100Bill died in hospice care in July, 2009, at the age of 87. He was a beloved friend and mentor, and he called me \"Number 3 Son\" (he had two actual sons). I still own many of the cameras, lenses, books, and equipment that he gave me. While we lived in Ann Arbor, I always felt that the darkroom was my little sanctuary, just like it had been for Bill. Moving to NC meant that I would have to finally give it up, and hopefully build a new one here.  I think that is the only thing that I miss from our Ann Arbor house - the darkroom that Bill had built.  I still have yet to build mine, but the downstairs bathroom is where I develop my film so I can scan it. I have plans to convert a large closet next to the bathroom into a small darkroom, and after our kitchen renovations are done in the spring of 2021, I will start working on the darkroom.  Another important date in my timeline is when I found out about the Film Photography Project. I think it was at Photostock in 2011 when I met a young Mat Marrash, who interviewed me. Within a few years I was a regular on the podcasts, and Michael Raso has become a great friend and collaborator. It’s allowed me to pass on my knowledge to hundreds of people via the podcasts, which I think Bill Brudon would have greatly enjoyed.  Mike Raso and I at Benny's, Ann Arbor. 2016So, anyway, back to scanning.  As I go through these binders, I am building up a library of images that I can use for other projects, future issues of Monochrome Mania, and to gather together material that will tell a story when I need it. I had a series of projects in mind when I lived in Michigan, and never felt that I had the quality of images to complete the projects. Going back through those files, with so much time removed from the time I shot them has given me a new viewpoint as to their value.  I sure as hell am glad that I shot on film, because it's really a lot easier to view a sheet of negatives than to scroll endlessly through computer files.  Argus C-4, December 2000. Nikon FE, T-Max 400 in Microdol-XThis year has been a tough one in regards to the COVID pandemic, but it's also made me take time and go through work that I haven't looked at in a long while.  I do hope 2021 will be much improved, and I can go on some long-overdue road trips to make new images of things that interest me. Oh, and I expect that I'll be using at least one of the Nikons that Bill gave me."},
{"title": "The 2021 Calendar is Available", "date": "Saturday, December 05, 2020", "text": "Every year for the past 10 years, I have produced a calendar. For years, they were of the gardens and flowers, but the past few years I have had a different focus. Last year it was trees, and Water is this year’s theme for my annual calendar. Most of the images were shot on film, and all are in monochrome, my favorite medium.  The calendars are on heavy glossy card stock, and wire-bound, with enough room to write events on the pages. I can’t think of a sound more relaxing and calming as the one I hear from a babbling brook. A rushing stream with small cascades is a common feature of my new home. Moving from Michigan to the mountains of North Carolina has opened up a whole new world of easily accessed photo opportunities, and while there are many amazing waterfalls, the details in a small creek can be just as interesting. Half of the images in this calendar were shot within 30 minutes of my home in Weaverville, NC.  The other half are from previous years and many different places. Photographing moving water can be challenging, and my aim has always been to stretch time, and let the water flow be represented as how I hear it.  We don't hear waterfalls at 1/200 sec - we hear them as a continuous, varying sound, and that's how I approach my photography of them.  In those long exposures, I see the variables, the different angles and arcs the water makes as it flows downstream.  A small trickle has the same patterns as a much larger stream, and it's somewhat like a fractal.  The effect is the same, and just as mesmerizing if you take the time to look.  Here's a list of the images, and you can purchase the calendar for $19, which includes US postage.

{"title": " The Magic and Allure of Toy Cameras", "date": "Sunday, November 29, 2020", "text": "Just a few of the cameras in Monochrome Mania #3If you have been following this blog for a while, you have probably seen a few recent posts about 620 and 120 low-fi cameras.  Whether you want to call them toy cameras, crappy cameras, low-fi cameras, or plastic fantastic wonders, is up to you. I’m sticking with toy cameras, because it’s a pretty simple term, but also a bit misleading.  To some, the \"toy camera\" conjures up a child’s toy that doesn’t really take photos, sort of like one of those Fisher-Price cameras with the rotating images.  That’s not what I am talking about here, or in my new issue of Monochrome Mania #3, \"The Magic and Allure of Toy cameras.\" These are cameras that lack a lot of the controls that we typically use in our photography, or have at best, a reduced amount of functionality.  That puts box cameras, plastic brownies, Dianas, Holgas, faux-TLR Duaflexes, and a bunch of other simple cameras under that umbrella. That lack of precise control is what makes them alluring, and you can make magic with them. Some of the crowd that attended the 2007 Cheap Shots exhibitThe work for this latest zine actually started in 2007, when I typed up a partial manuscript for a book on toy cameras.  I had just hung my \"Through A lens Softly\" show at Pierpont Commons at the University of Michigan, and I was also in the planning stages of an exhibit by members of the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, called \"Cheap Shots.\" While I had been using a Holga since late 2001 and an original Diana a little after that, it wasn’t until the formation of the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club in 2006, that I really became encouraged by the use of these cheap cameras. Finding kindred souls just as the digital onslaught was underway was a propitious event that influenced my creativity and social circles.  While I am no longer living in Michigan, I still keep in touch with my Crappy Camera friends.The many iterations of Kodak \"Brownies\" not all are 120/620.The manuscript sat dormant until 2019. As COVID-19 eliminated many of the activities that I had planned, I knew that working on a toy camera issue for my new zine Monochrome Mania would occupy my time.  What I soon realized, was that if I was going to expand the selection of cameras, I needed to go on eBay and purchase camera models that I once owned so that I could photograph them as well as run film through them. At one time, I probably had well over 250 cameras in my house in Ann Arbor, and over the course of a decade, sold off a lot of the ones that I had lost interest in, were shelf queens, or were just unrelated to my photographic interests at the time. Luckily, the market for cheap Bakelite cameras is not an expensive one, and I was able to procure ones that I felt should be in the issue. I limited the scope to medium-format toy cameras for a reason -- 120 and 620 film cameras offer the largest negatives, and one gets all the benefits of cheap lenses. There are quite a few models to choose from, as well.  I left out 127 cameras even though there were hundreds of models made. The film just isn’t readily available, and that made little sense to include them. I do plan on doing a follow-up issue with 35mm toy cameras sometime in 2021.I don’t know how many hours I spent on writing and rewriting the text for this issue, but the text went through several iterations, and several people received copies to read for any errors of fact and readability. My wife Adrienne is my copy editor and found places where I needed to be more clear.  I was also busy trying out cameras and re-spooling 120 onto 620 spools into October, before I felt that I had enough cameras to include in the issue. In searching for examples from the various models, I ended up going through all my filed negatives back to 2002. It turns out that I had scanned very few of those older negatives because I had made prints of some of them for shows, and the early work really pre-dated the explosion of social media. I found myself scanning in hundreds of negatives, and in doing so, found a good many excellent images that I had forgotten about. I realized that I had nearly 100 negative sheets from my Holgas alone. Another plus for film, as looking only for digital files would have been a real difficult task.sample pages from MM #3So, the issue \"The Magic and Allure of Toy Cameras\" is now available.  It contains reviews of over 20 cameras with historical information, tips on using them, how to modify them, and a multitude of images taken with these cameras.  Every camera reviewed is one that I have shot.  With over 100 figures, this zine is filled with photographs in its 36 pages.  I think it’s one of the best pieces of writing that I have done, and people that have already received a copy are really enthusiastic about it.   At $12 in the USA (which includes shipping) it’s one of the best bargains you’ll ever find.  Erwin, TN, Spartus Full-VueYou can order from my marketplace on Square -- links are to the right, and if you live outside of the USA, there are additional order options.  Like all of my issues of Monochrome Mania, this is a real, tangible, in-your-hands item. I do not offer digital versions. If you love film cameras, or know someone that does, this makes a great gift for yourself or others!Imperial 620 camera"},
{"title": " The Chinon CS SLR - Ordinary, But Good", "date": "Sunday, November 22, 2020", "text": "If you have been reading my posts over the last 16 years, you’ll probably see a pattern of my fondness for M-42 (Praktica, Screw Mount, Pentax screw-mount, etc.) cameras.  A lot of them were manufactured by many companies in the 1960s and 70s, and they ultimately died out as the Pentax K-mount supplanted it. The biggest drawback against the M-42 mount was that it took time to attach a lens, and the mount did not lend itself to electronic contacts or more complex automation of the cameras. However, since so many M-42 camera bodies and lenses were produced, the prices tend to stay lower, compared to K-mount cameras as well as the offerings from Nikon, Canon, Olympus, and Minolta. While Pentax Spotmatics are what people usually associate with the M-42 mount, there are other cameras that used the mount, and many of them are quite good, if not especially innovative. Such is the case with the Chinon CS.Chinon is a Japanese company that started in the city of Chino in 1948. Initially, the company produced only parts for lenses, but by 1956, it released a lens for 8mm movie cameras, followed by the world’s first 8mm zoom lens. Subsequently, they manufactured 8mm movie cameras, and the company at the time was known as Sanshin Optical Industrial Ltd.  The company started making 35mm cameras in 1971, and in 1973, changed its name to Chinon Industries. Chinon manufactured M-42 mount SLRs which were re-branded for other companies, such as Argus, GAF, Photo-Quelle, and Prinz. The Chinonflex TTL was introduced in 1966, followed by the Chinonflex in 1969. The Chinon CS appeared in 1978, and it features:    • TTL match-needle metering - CdS cell, center-weighted, stop-down, center-needle indicator in viewfinder.    • shutter speeds 1 sec - 1/1000 sec, + B.    • Depth of Field Preview    • Copal Square vertically-traveling metal shutter    • X-sync hot shoe as well as PC sockets for external flash, x-sync at 1/125 sec    • ISO range of 25-800    • 15 sec. Self-timer    • M-42 mount    • power - PX625 1.3V Mercury cellPretty standard layout, easy to use!Simplicity is a creative asset.So, while there is nothing that really stands out in the camera, everything is there that you need to take photos with full control of the exposure.  The only wrinkle is that like almost every other camera manufactured at the time, it requires a PX625 mercury cell for the meter.  In other words it’s a fairly ordinary, but well-built 35mm M-42 mount SLR. It doesn’t have the name recognition of Pentax or Praktica, but it can hold its own with any M-42 camera body made by anyone else at the time. I can say that had I owned this camera in 1978, I would have been won over very easily to its attributes, seeing that I owned an Exa 2a at the time. I picked this particular Chinon CS body up on eBay for $30, and I already had a matching Chinon 55 mm f/1.7 lens waiting for it. I used a PX625A alkaline cell, and then realized that to get a meter reading correct, I needed to dial down the ISO to one stop. So, for example, I was using ISO 400 film, I set the ASA (ISO) dial to 200, thereby compensating for the over-voltage of the cell.I loaded a roll of Holga 400 film (i.e., Foma 400), and took the Chinon CS out on some local trips to test it out.  The camera handles well; after all, it is \"ordinary\" and the stop-down metering button on the right side of the lens mount returns to its off position after the shutter is released.  The metering is center-weighted, and I had no issues with this 42 year-old SLR. The shutter has a satisfying \"clunk\" that is typical for the Copal Square shutters. I think that this camera encompasses the status quo in mid-1970s 35mm SLRs.  Nothing plastic, everything manual, and sturdily built. You can easily build your camera kit with cameras like this, as M-42 lenses are generally plentiful and relatively inexpensive, and mostly primes.  There are many other Chinon SLR models besides the CS, and a switchover to K-mount lenses occurred around 1981.  You can get an idea of the various models on the Camera-Wiki site. Some sample shots from the first roll:"},
{"title": " Golden Oldies: Pre-Set Lenses and T-mounts", "date": "Monday, November 16, 2020", "text": "Over the many years that I have been dealing with camera equipment, it seems that the least desirable (from a selling point) have been pre-set lenses and lenses that have a T-mount.  First of all, let me tell you what I am talking about here.  Two pre-set T-mount lenses, M42 mountWhen you photograph, you set your aperture on the lens and/or adjust your shutter speed until you get the light meter indicator to where it suggests the correct exposure. That’s pretty much how it works with any camera, including digital, unless you have it in complete auto mode, and the camera makes those decisions for you. If you are using an SLR, everything looks the same to you through the viewfinder, unless you push a button or lever to observe the depth of field, which stops down the lens to the chosen aperture. We do it so automatically, that it’s easy to not think about what is actually happening inside the camera.  That’s called open-aperture metering, and even though the lens is wide-open the mechanical or electronic linkages relay all that information to the metering system. When the shutter is fired, the lens then stops down to the selected aperture (assuming that you are not shooting wide-open, of course). It’s been with us since 1963, and adopted by most camera manufacturers by 1971. While cameras have evolved to do just about anything via some electronic adjustment, the basic system of aperture/shutter control is really all you need to control the exposure of an image.Aperture pin, (indicated by red circle) on a M42 lensBefore the days of open-aperture metering, we had stop-down metering, which means that you set your aperture and pushed a button or lever on the camera to actuate the diaphragm and the light meter.  The problem with that system is that the smaller the aperture, the dimmer the image, making focusing more difficult. If you have used a Pentax Spotmatic, Canon FT QL, Praktica, Zenit, Minolta SR, and any number of M-42 mount cameras, it’s likely that you have used stop-down metering. It’s why many lenses in the early days have an M and an A at the base of the lens. M=Manual, and the aperture is wherever you set it at all times, and the A = Automatic, meaning the aperture changes from wide open to the selected aperture when the shutter is released. Often such lenses have the word \"Auto\" on them, at least before it became standard on all cameras and lenses.Three different lenses with A and M controlTo actuate the diaphragm in the lens, there needs to be a small pin at the base that is pressed against by an arm or movable plate inside the camera at the moment the shutter button is pressed. Usually, that lever is in front of the mirror. It’s not needed for rangefinder cameras, or twin-lens reflex cameras, because you are not looking directly through the taking lens to focus and compose.  However, on an SLR, you want to have the view as bright as possible, so the lens only stops down when the shutter is released.  Pre-set T-mount lens has no aperture pinBut wait, what if there is no aperture actuator in the camera or on the lens?  You could still do the manual route and suffer with the dimmer image at smaller apertures, or you could use a pre-set lens. Pre-set lenses have two rings for setting the aperture(usually towards the front of the lens, not at the base). The foremost ring sets your final aperture, and the following ring closes the aperture when you are ready to shoot.  You can view your subject at the full aperture of your lens, and since your shooting aperture is been pre-set, you just close the second ring to shoot. I’ll tell you more about this later on why this is a good thing today. Simplified system - shooting aperture at top andC to close down, O to open upFinal aperture set at f/22, but open to view at f/2.8Final aperture at f/22135mm Spiratone lensT-mount on lens, adapter at rightNow, obviously, the pre-set system is rarely used on modern lenses, but back in the 1950s and 60s, it was pretty common.  It was also used a lot on T-mount lenses, which are third-party lenses made by a variety of manufacturers into the 1970s. The T-mount is a 42mm thread which has a different pitch than the M-42 mount that it is sometimes confused with.  The usual T-mount is a screw mount using a male 42×0.75 (42 mm diameter, 0.75 mm thread pitch) metric thread on the lens with a flange focal distance of 55 mm and a mating female 42mm thread on a camera adapter or other optical component.  The T mount is a mechanical-only mount, meaning it does nothing beyond physically connect the lens to the camera. It does not transfer electrical signals, auto-focus information, or aperture settings. So, the beauty of the T-mount is that you can use one lens with different SLR camera mounts, so long as you have the right T-mount adapter.  The other part of this is that you don’t have to worry about the linkage to an aperture pin, because there isn’t any.  The image below shows a Spiratone 135mm f/3.5 T-mount lens that I have used on M-42, Pentax K, Nikon F, Konica, Leica R, and Minolta SR/MD mount cameras.  You may ask why I would bother.  The aperture in this lens is completely circular due to the many-bladed diaphragm, and it gives very pleasing image. I have used it on digital SLRs, as well.  Since it’s also a pre-set lens. I can easily focus and stop the lens down to any aperture, not pre-determined click stops. T-mount lens with a variety of adaptersSo, here we are with some lenses from a time when NOTHING was automatic, yet they can still be used today, with the proper adapter, on your film SLR or your DSLR or mirrorless camera.  The beauty of the pre-set lens becomes more apparent when you see the image on your LCD, and adjust the aperture to get exactly what you want in the image.  Since there are no electronic connections, you may have to do all the exposures in Manual mode with some cameras, and Aperture-Priority in others.I should add that not all T-mount lenses are vintage. Some T-mounts date from the 1980s, and are often seen on mirror telephoto lenses, oddball art lenses, slide copying units, and telescope and microscope adapters. You can also buy new 500mm telephoto lenses that use the T-mount, AND have pre-set apertures. So, the T-mount and pre-set lenses have never really gone away after all these years. The beauty is that you can usually pick up a used T-mount lens or a pre-set lens quite cheaply, and the only factor will be if you can find a T-mount adapter for your SLR. T-mount adapters are easily found for M-42 Pentax screw mount, Pentax K-mount, Nikon F-mount, Olympus OM, Minolta SR, and Canon FL. I think I have seen most pre-set lenses/T-mounts for M-42, as it was a very popular mount before the mid-1970s."},
{"title": " Rollei RPX 100, One-roll Review", "date": "Saturday, November 14, 2020", "text": "I had hoped to have shot and developed this film before I posted my list of 100 ISO b&w films here on RCB back in September.  Anyhow, the roll sat in my Nikon FM3a for over a month before I finished with it, and last week I finally got around to developing it.  I have read good things about the Rollei RPX films, and I know a few photographers that really, really, like them.  Of course, as I wrote here previously, “RPX 100 may be the \"same\" as the old APX 100, but Rollei of course, does not make film, and neither does Maco, who bought the rights to use the Rollei branding. What's the film's origin? I really don't have an answer to that question. It is purported to have extended red sensitivity, and is available in 35mm and 120.”  After shooting a roll, and developing in Rodinal, I can say that it definitely is not the old APX 100.  Of course, neither is the new APX 100!  But does it matter what the film’s origins are?  The results I got from the RPX 100 are very good, with a nice range of tones and imperceptible grain. It has excellent latitude, and while I did not test it for extended red sensitivity, others have done so with good results. I did use a yellow filter and or a polarizer on some landscape shots during sunny days.I really appreciate that there are developing instruction printed inside the box of film. Even though the Massive Development Chart has the same information, there is something that just feels right about having it printed.  That’s just my “old man” attitude.  If we are going analog, might as well have analog information, too.  I loaded my Nikon FM3a (Nikon deserves every accolade given for making this camera, and damn, they should still be manufacturing them.) with the RPX 100 when I was at the Biltmore Estate on August 13. I have more than one Nikon SLR, so I wasn’t always shooting with the FM3a.  I finished the roll on September 30, while visiting the Blue Ridge parkway on a bright, sunny day.  In between, there are shots from around home, Asheville, and Mars Hill, NC. While I mostly used the 50 mm f/1.8 Nikkor, I did use a telephoto while on the Blue Ridge Parkway.Developing – I developed the RPX 100 in Rodinal 1:25 dilution for 9 minutes.  When I poured out the developer, it did not have that nice purple color that I used to get with the original APX 100. The film dries nice and flat and is easy to scan. I scanned the negatives with my Epson V700 photo scanner.Here are a few examples from the roll. Overall, I am really pleased with this film.  Price-wise, it’s not all that expensive. It’s cheaper than TMax100, but more expensive than Fomapan 100 and Kentmere 100, two of my favorite ISO 100 films. You can also buy it in bulk 100 ft rolls to spool yourself.  The mere fact that it is also available in 120, should give you a reason to try a roll or two!"},
{"title": " Kodak Brownie Reflex 20", "date": "Saturday, October 31, 2020", "text": "I have been fairly quiet on the blogging front, as I have been preoccupied with getting another 'zine ready. Monochrome Mania #3 is ready to go to print, and it just happens that I left out one camera from my selection of lo-fi cameras in the issue. I ended up buying a bunch of 620 cameras while preparing the material for the next issue of Monochrome Mania. Some of them were models that that I had owned at one time, over a decade ago. I wanted to be be able to photograph them all, as well as run a roll or two of film to see the results with a more nuanced eye than I would have had back then.  One thing I noticed right away, is that while some manufacturers kept putting the same camera out for years with nothing more than cosmetic changes (i.e., the Spartus Full-Vue), others, such as Kodak took a basic design and changed it up a bit, and gave it a different name with each iteration.  Such is the case with the Brownie Reflex 20.  I previously wrote a post about the Kodak Brownie Twin 20, which I found to be easy to use, and produced satisfactory results. The Brownie Reflex 20 is pretty much the same camera, but with only a nice bright waist-level reflex viewfinder. This faux-TLR features the same EV aperture selection, one shutter speed, and body shape and controls as the Twin 20.  The brilliant viewfinder is easy to use, and I think makes it a better \"user\" than the Twin 20.  If you are out and about in the eBay Universe, or maybe your local thrift store, you should also take a look at the Kodak Brownie Flash 20 or the Brownie Flashmite 20. Again, these models have identical controls as the Twin 20 and reflex 20 cameras, but incorporate an eye-level viewfinder and a built-in flash, with the Flashmite 20 using a small AG-1 flashbulb, and the Flash 20 using an M8 bulb. The keyword in looking for these cameras is the \"20\" designation, which means they use 620 film.  Of course, you can respool 120 to 620 spools giving you a broader selection of film. The EV markings are equivalent to f/11, f/16, and f/22, all at about 1/100 sec.  I found that I could use the same 33mm Series VI filter adapter that I used on the Twin 20, so I presume that holds true for the other two models mentioned here.  These cameras are not to be confused with the smaller Kodak 127 cameras that look similar, such as the Starflex, Starmite, Starflash, or Startech.  Using the Reflex 20 was the same as the Twin 20, except for the fact that the brilliant reflex viewfinder made composition easier and goes well with the placement of the shutter button.  I loaded some respooled Tmax 100 that was about 20 years expired, and developed in in HC110B for 6 minutes. Results were excellent!  The Tmax 100 had been refrigerated for most of its life, and is a perfect film for these cameras.  I basically shot most of the 12 exposures walking around the Vance monument in Asheville, NC. Overall, I'd say this this is my favorite Brownie-labeled camera, a notch up from the Brownie Hawkeye, with better ergonomics and some means of exposure control and zone-focus.  The Brownie - 20 series cameras were made from 1959 to mid-1960s,and I feel that the Reflex 20 is the best of the bunch. All four models take 6x6 cm negatives on 620, have the same zone-focus and EV aperture settings, but the Reflex 20 has the best viewfinder and a separate flash unit that most people will never use, anyway.  Drop in some 100 ISO film and you are ready to go.Here are a few images.  Those lenses are actually quite good, in comparison with a Holga or Diana."},
{"title": " Holga Week 2020", "date": "Friday, October 02, 2020", "text": "While I confess that I don't really pay much attention to camera-themed events (with the exception of World Wide Pinhole Photography Day), Holga Week strikes me as a good opportunity to let the Holga love out. I know, today is October 2, and Holga Week runs from Oct. 1-7.  I've been working on issue 3 of Monochrome Mania, and it's totally focused on medium-format toy cameras...like the Holga.   Last night I was going through sheet after sheet of negatives from my Holgas - and realized that I have almost 1000 images with them.  Probably more than most people, so for me, a week isn't really a thing.  Years, more like it - almost 20 years of Holgas.  Of course I'll do some shots this week, because I would, anyway.  However, I am always happy to see toy cameras get some love and attention, whether it's World Toy Camera Day, Diana Day, or Holga Week, it's all good.  People need to understand that these plastic cameras are not just some bit of fun to get picked up now and then, but also that they are creative tools that let us show things in a different way.  If images from Michael Kenna can't convince you that a Holga is a very special camera, then I guess nothing will.  I don't think that $40 for a Holga is outlandish.  I have every Holga I bought, and almost 20 years later, my first Holga still works fine.  Simply plastic fantastic, with a simplicity that will allow you to be creative.  So, if you are on the fence about buying a Holga or using one, give it a try. It's still my favorite low-fi camera for a lot of reasons, and I own a half-dozen of the 120 models. I have owned the Holga 120 wide pinhole, and still have the Holga 135 Panoramic and Holga 135.  Their plastic construction and plastic lens is part of the charm. Yet, the images made with them can be jaw-dropping beautiful.  The Holga 120N is easily modified, and a quick web search will reveal a lot of ways that it's been modified by people. Last year, I modified one my Holgas to have a hexagonal image mask.  I am doing a long-term project with it, and hope to have some interesting results.  A lot of people have asked if the Holga is a good introduction to medium format photography.  My answer is no.  Your expectation of medium format is a larger, more detailed negative -- and you'll get that with a twin-lens reflex as the entry to medium format.  The Holga and the Diana and similar low-fi 120 cameras will give you something, but you need to know the limitations and make them work for you in composition, lighting, and subject. Another point is that because the Holga has limited adjustments for exposure, you can easily tape a colored orange, yellow, or red gel over the lens to compensate in b&w film, or use a neutral density filter for color (and yes, it works for b&w, too).   You can also use an external flash for poorly lit situations, or use the B setting while on a sturdy tripod for long exposures.  An adapter allows you to use studio strobes for anyone wishing to do so.  You can add a thread mount filter ring to the front of your Holga by firmly screwing in a 46mm to 49mm adapter ring, allowing you to use 49mm filters.The Holga 120N takes readily available 120 film.  In bright daylight, 100 ISO film is fine, but 400 ISO film will be fine in almost any situation.  If you haven't used a Holga before, don't sweat it.  Before long, you'll appreciate its quirky features, and think less about the use, and more about the image.  Light leaks?  I just use artist's black masking tape or gaffer tape.  My biggest fear is that the back will come loose, so I use gaffer tape over the metal clasp on each side to avoid that. That's pretty much the only weakness of this plastic fantastic icon of the toy camera world.And now, for some images from over the years from my Holga cameras:"},
{"title": "The B&W 100 ISO Club", "date": "Thursday, September 17, 2020", "text": "I was recently looking through my film stash and picking out some rolls to bring along on a photo outing, when it struck me -- there are a lot of \"medium\" speed b&w 100 ISO films out there. Or are there? How many are merely the same film with a different name, repackaged for another outlet? So, began to tally up what I have here, and then I looked online to see what was available. Generally, speaking, I find 100 ISO to be that sweet spot for films that I can use for landscape photography, walking around photography, and any situation where I really don't need the extra speed. It's a good choice especially for older manual cameras that may not have a good range of faster shutter speeds, and for shooting under conditions where using a lens at wider apertures is desirable. In addition, 100 ISO films tend to be finer-grained than 400 ISO, but that is not always the case.In this list, I have 27 names of 100 ISO film. You can be assured that the following companies make the film with their name on it: Adox, Astrum (Svema), Foma, Ilford (Harman), Kodak,Orwo, Tasma. More recently, Lucky Film in China released the Lucky SHD 100 in 2017, but it may have stopped production in 2019, so Lucky isn't on the current list of manufacturers. Likewise, the Shanghai brand was started again in 2019, but I cannot verify that they are making the film in China.In alphabetical order:Adox CHS 100 II - Have yet to try this Adox film. Alex Luyckx has a review of it. It's a classic, single layer panchromatic emulsion that is fine-grained. Since the actetate base is clear, it can be used for reversal processing. DataSheetAdox Silvermax 100 - If you read Adox's description of its Silvermax 100, it discusses the special Silvermax developer used to achieve the fantastic tonality, and adds, \"In conventional developers results will be close to those achievable with APX 100 (old version-Made in Germany).\" That reinforces the claims that APX 100 is something else. DataSheet Agfaphoto APX 100 - I loved the original Agfa APX 100, back when it truly was an Agfa film. Developed in Rodinal, APX 100 turned that developer a deep purple when poured out. This new APX 100 doesn't do that, and of course, since Agfa went out of business in 2005, the name Agfaphoto is owned by Lupus Imaging and Media GmbH & Co., which does not produce the film, but relabels another manufacturer's product. There's nothing wrong with this current film, as it's very likely Kentmere 100. However, you may as well buy the Kentmere and save money on buying something just because it says APX 100. This is NOT the same as the film that I used a decade ago. The last of the REAL APX 100 was made in 2005, and the film has held up well in storage, should you find some online. Data Sheet is here.Arista 100 (= Fomapan 100). Arista is Freestyle Photo's brand, and it's a well-known name. Currently, I am 99.99% certain that Arista 100 is the same as Fomapan 100 Classic. The Arista bulk rolls are in the same packaging as the bulk rolls of Fomapan. Prices of Arista 100 and Fomapan 100 are pretty close. It's available in 35mm, 120, and sheet film. It's a great value, and Freestyle's been selling tons of it.Astrum Foto 100 - From what I have been able to find, Astrum is the current company in Ukraine that bought out the Svema factory. The films that it sells under the Astrum name appear to be essentially the same as the old Svema products. The Astrum Photo 100 is on a mylar base, is a bit contrasty, and fine-grained, same as the Svema 100. As far as I know it is only available in 35mm. It is said to have near-IR sensitivity with a red filter and a few stops of overexposure. I have not tried using it with the red filter.Derev Pan 100 - A film marketed by the Film Photography Project, Derev Pan 100 is a Ukraine-made panchromatic film on a tough mylar base. It was probably an aerial surveillance film, and exhibits very fine grain and wide latitude, producing a lovely tonal scale in landscape images. It definitely lies flat in the scanner. The mylar base means that you need to be careful in loading the film, so it is best to load under low light conditions. It is available only in 35mm.Fomapan 100 Classic - An all-around good film, inexpensive, and available in bulk rolls. Also repackaged by Kosmo Foto, Freestyle, and Lomography (Earl Grey). 120 and 35mm versions. I have shot Fomapan 100 labeled as such, as well as the rebranded versions from Freestyle, etc. This is a dependable film that delivers results that are consistent and to my liking. I have to wonder why people spend a few more $$/roll to buy a \"boutique\" film, when the Fomapan 100 is what they are shooting. Buy it in bulk and respool it yourself and add your own label, such as \"KickAss 100.\" Available in 35mm, 120, and sheet film. Data Sheet Fomapan R100 BW - This intended as a reversal film, to produce postive b&w images on a clear base. The film is intended to give a proper spectral repsonse as gray scale, and it is a replacement for the Agfa Scala film. You'll need to specially develop to get a positive, and the film is also available in Double-8mm and 16mm reels to produce movies. The Foma Black and White Reversal Processing Kit for Fomapan R100 is necessary for the b&w positives, and can also be used with Adox SilverMax and Agfa Scala film. Data Sheet Fujifilm Neopan Acros II 100 - This is not the Fujifilm Neopan Acros that we knew and loved. This new film isn't manufactured in Japan by Fujifilm, but in the EU - perhaps by Harman for Fujifilm. It does not appear to be repackaged Kentmere 100, but an emulsion coated by Harman to Fujifilm's specifications. Data SheetIlford Delta 100 Professional - A T-grain film, much like TMax 100, Ilford Delta 100 is excellent. For some reason, I don't use it all that much, probably because it is more expensive than Kentmere 100. It delivers excellent results and is available in 35mm, 120, and sheet films. DataSheetIlford FP4 Plus – While this is advertised as an ISO 125 film, you can shoot it easily at 100. The heir apparent at ISO 125 after Plus-X was discontinued by Kodak. Seriously there is nothing wrong this film. It's a great b&w film that is available in 35mm, 120, and sheet film. Data SheetKentmere 100 - This film is one of my favorite 100 ISO b&w films, period. It's also repackaged as Ultrafine Extreme 100, and possibly, Agfaphoto APX 100. I reviewed the film in 2016, and it really is a great all-purpose film. It's been renamed by Harman as Kentmere Pan 100 (2018). Kentmere 100 is available only in 35mm .  Data SheetKodak Tmax 100 - When Kodak discontinued Plus-X Pan, I was not too sad about it. Plus-X was an okay film, but I really loved Verichrome Pan a lot more. However, TMax 100 is an excellent, fine-grained film that delivers consistent results, has excellent tonal range, and I especially like it in 120. It does well with common developers, too. TMX100 is available in 35mm and 120, and of course, sheet films. DataSheetKosmo Foto Mono 100 (=Fomapan 100) - I reviewed Kosmo Foto Mono in 2018. Any comments on Fomapan 100 apply here. I love the packaging, and I give kudos to Steve Dowling for coming up with this branding. Available in 35mm and 120.Lomography Earl Grey 100 - I reviewed this film in 2011, and at the time, I believed it was Fomapan 100. I have not inspected any recent rolls of this film , so do not know if the source has changed. It makes sense to stick with what works, and I hope that the Fomapan 100 is still the source for the Earl Grey.Lomography Potsdam Kino 100 (= Orwo UN54) - I recently reviewed this film  and since it is ORWO UN54, the review applies to the Orwo and Lomography films. I think it's a very good film with moderate grain.  It's good to see these Lomography films from Orwo in general use, as they probably would not get much attention otherwise.Lucky SHD 100 - This film was released in 2017, and it's apparently not the old Lucky 100 (which I shot over 15 years ago, and it lacked an antihalation layer). This new film seems like it was discontinued in 2019, but I don't have much information on it. Made in China, and likely a very limited distribution. Check eBay for it.Oriental Seagull 100 - Manufactured by Harman, it is probably Kentmere 100, packaged exclusively for the Japanese market. Here is one review.ORWO UN54 - Orwo's branding leaves something to be desired, but it is a good 100 ISO film. See my review under the Lomo Kino Potsdam 100. Available only in 35mm. DataSheet Rollei Blackbird Creative 100 - This is a strange film that I have yet to test. It can be shot at ISO 25-100, it's orthopanchromatic, and is supposed to have extremely high resolution. It's coated on a Mylar base, and is said to have deep mid-tones and rich blacks. It appears that light piping is a problem, so keep the film in a black canister and load in dim light. There is little information available about this film, typical for Maco/Rollei branding.Rollei RPX 100 - I have just started shooting with this film. RPX 100 may be the \"same\" as the old APX 100, but Rollei of course, does not make film, and neither does Maco, who bought the rights to use the Rollei branding. What's the film's origin? I really don't have an answer to that question. It is purported to have extended red sensitivity, and is available in 35mm and 120. After I finish shooting the couple of rolls, I will have a review here. Data sheet Revolog Snovlox 100 - Revolog, infamous for its crazy color-treated films, has a b&w 100 ISO film, from their description - \"Snovlox is a black and white film. The effect of this film is similar to the Volvox film, but due to their white colour the effect reminds of snowflakes. Want to magically transform your beach pictures into a winter-wonderland? Then this film is perfect for you!\" This film is Kodak TMax 100 that's been treated (pre-flashed?) to have a snow-like effect. If this is your thing, it's worth a try.Shanghai Film GP3 100 - From China, this film is currently available in 35mm and 120. The 35mm is in plastic cassettes, which makes it a pain in the butt to open in the dark. A leader retriever should be used to pull the film out of the cassette in the dark to load it into the developing tank. The film isn't exactly cheap, and costs 2x as much as Fomapan. The 35mm is apparently coated by ORWO, but it's not readily available in the US. The 120 GP3 is being carried by a few US sellers, but you can buy it cheaper on eBay direct from China. If the film was noted for high quality, I'd say go for it, but I have yet to try it.Svema Foto 100 - The FPP sells this film, and it's a fairly good film on a thin mylar base. Light-piping may occur, so keep the film in a dark container, and in general, load in subdued light. To me, the mylar base is so thin that it's a problem to put into the negative sheet protectors. In my opinion, there are better 100 ISO films, but this is an interesting film. It can be somewhat contrasty, and I find it to be a good film for landscapes with clouds.Tasma NK-II 100 – I really wanted to like this film, but many of my negatives had a band of dark grain running across the frame that showed up in skies and less dense parts of the image. It's on a thin Mylar base, like the Svema 100. While the tonality was very nice, and I liked my overall results, the odd dark specks really changed my mind from my initial review. It's nothing to do with my developing technique – it's either a coating flaw or a bad batch from the factory. Perhaps it was only a few bad rolls, but I have seen it several times. Only available in 35mm.Ultrafine Extreme 100 (=Kentmere 100)-  I reviewed this film recently, and it's a great film. Kentmere 100, at a great price. I think the 120 film is especially a great bargain, and it's the one I buy for my medium-format cameras. The Ultrafine films are available from Photowarehouse, AKA Ultrafine Online.Washi F Flourographic X-ray film – This is a unique film that may appeal to those that like to experiment with oddball films. It's an orthochromatic film lacking an anti-halation layer, and noticeable grain. You'll get some nice ”glow” where there is any reflectance of the sun or other specular highlights. I consider it to be an interesting film if you are looking for some atmospheric effect in your shots. Available in 35mm and 120, it should be loaded under subdued light. Film Washi is a small producer and repackager of interesting films, some of them handmade. If you are looking for something different and a creative spark, their film lineup is definitely worth consideration. I did a quick review of the Film Washi S and F films in 2019.  The data sheet is here.My advice on 100 ISO b&w filmsIn looking through all the different emulsions currently available, it's obvious that there are a few films that have a great cost/result attribute, and that would be Kentmere 100 and Fomapan 100. Apart from them being readily available either as the manufacturer's brand, or in a re-branded label, they have dependable results, a great track record, and can be developed with just about any developer. In the end, I recommend finding one emulsion that does what you want and stick to it. Regularly shooting the same film and developing with the same developer will give you better, repeatable results, and confidence that you'll get the shot. You get to know the quirks of a film and can bend it to your will via a developer or how you expose it. However, as these films do vary in their characteristics – grain structure, spectral sensitivity, latitude, contrast, and the physical attributes of whether they curl, cup, or lie flat, there may be a film to try so see if it's “right for you.” There lies the beauty of film – so many variables, and so many ways to mess up. There are a lot of reviews on many of these films - and its obvious that people will have differing views of the same film.   If you find a film that really sticks with you, it makes sense to buy it in bulk rolls and reload your own cassettes.  In doing so, you'll save money. My favorite developers tend to be HC110 and Rodinal, followed by D-96 and D-76. 100 ISO film is pretty much my go-to for average shooting, and I tend to use Kentmere 100 for the bulk of those shots."},
{"title": "The Kodak Brownie Twin 20 ", "date": "Thursday, September 10, 2020", "text": "This attractive 620 film camera features both waist-level and eye-level viewfinders, hence the Twin part of the name.  The camera was produced from 1959-1964,  and you will often see it for sale in the box with flash, a space for batteries, and the space for a roll of film. The lens has an aperture of f/11, and there is zone focusing.  While there is no B setting, there are three apertures - EV13 - f/11, EV14- f/16, and EV15- F/22.  The shutter speed is approximately 1/100 sec.    The reflex viewfinder is very easy to use, and I find myself preferring it over the eye-level finder.  The camera came with a screw-on flash that uses AG-1 bulbs.  It's quite attractive and modern-looking, in that mid-century style.I feel the zone focus and ergonomics are the principal attraction to this camera, and if it had B exposure along with a tripod socket, it would certainly rank among the top of my list.  I found that a press-on 33mm Series VI adapter fits over the front of the lens barrel, and allows me to use a yellow filter, which I feel is a great addition for skies.    Remember to move the switch to Exp. 1-12 after loading the film and advancing to frame 1.The only really oddball thing about this camera is that Kodak expects one to switch a lever on the bottom of the camera to \"Load\" when rolling on a new roll of film, until exposure 1 pops up in the red window.  Then press  the lever to Exposures 1-12 so that the wind-on stops exactly at the next frame number.  If you forget and start the wind-on in the 1-12 position, you'll never get it where you want it to be.  You then have to switch back to \"Load\" to get to the next frame number in the red window.  Might as well leave it on Load all the time.  Its sister camera is the Brownie Reflex 20, which has the same features, but lacks the eye-level viewfinder.   That one is definitely worth a try if you should see it in a shop somewhere.Yellow filter attached with Series VI 33mm adapterI took the Twin 20 out on an excursion last week to Spruce Pine, NC, and shot a roll of 1997 expired Tmax 400.  I have had good luck with this expired film, and used a yellow filter while shooting in the sun.  I developed it in HC110-B.  I am pretty happy with the results.  Zone focusing worked well, and I kept the aperture at f/11 on all of the shots."},
{"title": "Simple,  Yet Effective. The Imperial Six-Twenty ", "date": "Saturday, August 29, 2020", "text": "The Chicago-based Herbert George Camera Co. (founded in 1945 by Herbert Weil and George Israel), which in 1961 became the Imperial Camera Co., manufactured a slew of simple plastic cameras. Since they were made in many colors, and some were \"official\" cameras for either the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, they have became collectibles in their own right. It's easy to dismiss these as mid-century plastic cameras, but imagine the millions of snapshots that probably resulted from them.While many of them are better-made than the flimsy Diana, they are very simple snap-shot cameras, and may often give results that even a Diana would be envious of. The lenses are simple meniscus glass lenses, with a fixed aperture of about f/11 and shutter speed of about 1/30- 1/60 sec. Most of the cameras they produced took 127 or 620 film, with a few that took the Instamatic 126 cartridges in the latter half of the 1960s. Although they are basic snapshot cameras, many did have some very nice styling and often incorporated a flash (bulbs only) in the body, or via a flash attachment.   With so many other toy cameras available, they often get overlooked, but they are toy cameras in every sense of the word. My first example of an Imperial Mark XII looked to be in excellent condition.  However, after shooting a roll of long-expired Tri-X, it appears that the lens is not aligned correctly. Every single image was slightly out-of-focus.  I have since ordered another camera on eBay, and look forward to testing it.Pretty, but oh so awful images!These cameras are simple.  My latest acquisition is an Imperial Six-Twenty Snapshot Camera.  Originally labeled as the Herco Six-Twenty about 1950, this camera must date from as far back as 1961, when Imperial became the brand.  This camera is the most basic of plastic box cameras, measuring about 3.25, x 3.35 x 2.4 inches, weighing just over 6 ounces without film. I had seen results from the Six-Twenty online, and knew that it was capable of pretty acceptable results.   taped that yellow gel right over the lens.After I cleaned it up (amazing how grimy these cameras can be!), it was ready for a test.  I loaded a roll of re-spooled 1997 expired Tmax 400, and taped on a yellow gel over the lens. I figured that it would be great if I got any sky in the photos.  I took the camera for a quick trip to the Asheville River Arts District  - a great place to test out a camera.  I shot the roll and processed it it D-96.  I am really thrilled with the results. You don't have to spend a lot of money on this model, and price-wise, they are worth about $5-$10.  If you don't mind respooling 120 onto 620 spools, there is a whole world of inexpensive cameras to play with.  Look for the Imperial Debonair,  Imperial Savoy, Imperial Mark XII, Imperial Six-Twenty, Imperial Deluxe Twin-Lens Reflex, and  Herbert George Sabre 620.  These will all give 12 6x6 cm images.  Prices on eBay generally run from less than $10 to over $50, depending on the model and the color.   If you don't mind respooling your film, these cameras will be great with 100 ISO films.   Oh, and here are a few of the \"best\" images from the Mark XII:"},
{"title": "Is the Diana+ Glass Lens Worth It?", "date": "Saturday, August 22, 2020", "text": "In 2015, Lomography introduced their 75 mm glass lens unit for the Diana+ series of cameras.  Like anything from Lomography, you have to wade through the hyperbole and decide if the latest and greatest thing from them is worth a dent in your checking account.  As lenses, go, it's relatively inexpensive - $49 from Lomography, and perhaps cheaper from resellers.   I acquired mine last year, and initially, I used it with the Diana to Nikon F-mount adapter.  Results were okay, and certainly better than the plastic meniscus Diana lens.  After all, the Diana + glass lens has three coated elements!  It's also a much better built unit than the plastic lens.  Everything about it seems to be more robust.   To use it, you unlock the plastic lens from the barrel, and replace it with the new lens.  Easy.  However, even with a 35 mm frame, you lose the vignetting effect that the lenses give on 120 film.  I finally replaced the old lens on my Diana+ with the new glass lens, and shot a roll with it a few weeks ago.   I like the Diana+ Glass lens a lot.  I used the smaller frame mask in the camera, which is about 42 mm square, same as the original Dianas.  I did not see much vignetting, so the next roll will be used with the larger mask, to give a 46.5 mm square.  One of the things I enjoy about the Diana+ is its ease of use and versatility.  Lomography gets full marks for taking a fairly basic toy camera and making into a system.Here are a few scans from the negatives. All but one are from the Vance Birthplace Historic Site near Weaverville, NC.  I used expired Kodak Tmax 400.  It had been a while since I had used the Diana+, and now it's back in my bag for more adventures.

{"title": "The Kodak Duex", "date": "Thursday, August 20, 2020", "text": "This camera came from a friend's basement, where it had sat for quite some time.  Other than the usual dust and grime that comes from sitting around, it was in great shape.  There is some internal dust on the lens, but it did not seem to affect the negatives.  It sat in a box for over a year after we moved to NC, and in preparation for a zine on toy cameras, I thought it would be worthwhile to give the camera a try. The Duex was manufactured from 1940-42, and my example came from Canada, and was manufactured there.  It's hard to believe that the camera is about 80 years old.  Yet, it's rather stylish, but still, a pretty simple camera.  The Duex is one of the few Kodak cameras that shoots 16 images on 620.  The camera is unusual and readily identified by the large Bakelite helical that extends from the body to the proper length for taking photos.  The lens has an aperture of f/11, and the shutter speeds are Instant ( ca. 1/30 sec) and Bulb.  The base of the camera has a tripod socket.  The direct vision viewfinder is centered on the top deck of the camera.  The camera has a surprisingly comfortable feel in the hands, with its rounded, thin body.  There are a lot of potential toy cameras out there that would be ideal shooters if it were not for the fact that they require 620 film, which was discontinued by Kodak in 1995.  It can be quite frustrating to a novice to pick up a nice vintage camera only to find that a spool of 120 film does not fit into it.  For starters, any camera made by Kodak after 1931 that takes 6x4.5, 6x6, or 6x9 cm images uses 620 film.  It's a different scenario when looking at vintage roll film cameras from Europe, most of which used 120 film.  Of course, I had to re-spool a roll of film to test this camera, but with a changing bag and 2 620 spools it's quite easy. The reason for two 620 is spools is that I spool from the 120 to the 620, but of course, that roll would be backwards if used in the camera. So, I then spool from the first 620 spool to another 620 spool to get the film back into its original state.   All done inside the changing bag, of course.I took the Duex on a short trip to Marshall, NC and then along the French Broad River.  I shot one roll of Tmax 100, expired in 2000. The images are really quite good, much to my surprise.  I used a tripod on the long exposures, but otherwise, it was handheld.  It's a little disconcerting turning it sideways to shoot in landscape mode, but the camera handles well.  The following scans are of the Tmax 100, developed in HC-110B for 6 minutes.  HC-110 is recommended for expired films as it seems to keep the base fog down.Actually shooting with the Duex really changed my mind about the camera.  The images came out great, with very little distortion, and no vignetting.  Certainly much better than a Diana.  This camera now gets my vote as one that people should try shooting with.  Since it has a tripod mount, you can use it in B mode, and if the light is too bright, or you want to go for the long exposure, you can tape a ND filter over the lens."},
{"title": "Slow Speed Serendipity", "date": "Saturday, August 01, 2020", "text": "If you have been following Random Camera Blog over the years, you'll konw that I have been experimenting with low-iso films for quite a while.  If you haven't yet purchased a copy of Monochrome Mania Number 1, which is all about low-iso film, I still have some available for purchase and see the link in the sidebar.   More than 4 years ago, Mike Raso gave me a short roll of what was then the Svema Blue-Sensitive Film at ISO 1.5.  It sat around in the open in a translucent container, in and out of camera bags, and one day in late July, I finally decided to use it while shooting along the French Broad River near Asheville, NC.  I knew that the slow film would enable me to get some nice long exposures of the swift current.With exposures running from 4 to 8 seconds, I hoped that they would have a real smooth appearance to them. Also of note, the film is Blue-sensitive (Orthochromatic) and doesn't see red, so the tonality of the image would be quite different than what you would get with a full-spectrum panchromatic film, such as Ilford Pan-F.Sometimes I find that my results didn't meet my expectations, and instead of saying \"ugh,\" I take a different tact and see what I can do with the negative.  The film was developed in POTA developer at 24°C for 13 minutes.  Turns out that this roll of Blue-Sensitive film is a victim of light-piping, as the PET film base transmits light like an optical fiber.  With no anti-halation layer, and a clear plastic storage canister, it only compounded the problem, as the film was fogged.  I didn't expect much from the scans. However, I realized that with the fog, imperfections, and long-exposure (ca. ISO 2), they looked like something from a wet-plate collodion negative. I'll try this stuff again, as I like the look of the film, but next time I'll get some fresh from the FPP! The newer version of the FPP Blue-Sensitive is at ISO 6, which will still give me the look that I am after.  Compare the last image with this one, taken with my iPhone XR, to get an idea of how the Orthochromatic film captures the tones."},

I'm 99.9% certain the UXF 400 is Kentmere 400, and after looking at recent negatives and processing times, I'm quite certain that UXF 100 is re-branded Kentmere 100.  That's a good thing, because I have also been happy with my results from Kentmere 100, and the Ultrafine prices for their re-branded films is one of the best film deals out there.  I typically buy Ultrafine-branded b&w film in 100 ft rolls and spool it myself.  If you don't want to buy 100 ft rolls, this film is also extremely affordable at less than $4 per 36 exp. roll!  There is no plastic core with the bulk roll, but I have not experienced any problems while using my Alden film loader.UXF 100 is a \"medium\" speed fine-grained panchromatic film that works well in a variety of developers.  My favorite developer for this film is D-76, diluted 1:1, for 11.5 minutes at 20°C.  The film lies extremely flat for scanning, with no curling or warping.  It scans beautifully.  At 100 ISO, it covers a broad array of situations, and has the kind of contrast that I like in a film.  Others have reviewed this film, and they are mostly quite positive.  Alex Luyckx pushed the film to 200 with great results, which is good news for those that like shooting outside the box.  Ultrafine Extreme 100 is also available in 120, and that has become my preferred 100 ISO film for medium format.  Check out the two quite diverse images below - one from a pinhole camera, and the other from my YashicaMat 124.  In short, this is a budget film that yields excellent results without any quirks, weird developers, or special treatment.  For those that are looking for a film to use in photo classes, I highly recommend  Ultrafine Extreme 100.  The COVID-19 situation has affected the supply chain, so you may want to make sure the film is in stock before your order.Reems Creek Falls, April 2020, Pinbox Pinhole.

{"title": "Lomography's Lomo Kino Films - Potsdam and Berlin", "date": "Sunday, July 12, 2020", "text": "It's been quite a while since I reviewed a b&w film from Lomography.  Back in 2011, I reviewed Lady  and Earle Grey films. Since then, Lomography has really expanded their line of film offerings, especially in the color emulsions, some of which I have also reviewed.   Lomography's style of branding and their target audience- young, adventurous and film-curious, has made an impact on how film is marketed.  Few people get excited if I asked them about Fompapan 100, but slap a different brand name on it with attractive packaging, and the film gets sought after.  So too, have Lomography's \"new\" black and white emulsions, under the branding of Lomography Kino films, come into the hands of people that would never have heard of ORWO cine films.  I'll give Lomography credit -- I like their advertising and how they hype up an emulsion, and that's okay.  If it gets more people interested in trying something new, that's great.  Some may even find that a particular emulsion provides an opportunity to be creative with a result that matches their vision.  This review will cover the two emulsions that Lomography has released under the \"kino\" name:  Berlin - ISO 400, and Potsdam - ISO 100.  First of all what exactly does Lomography mean by the \"kino\" (cinema) label?  Who makes this film?   Here's Lomography's description for the Berlin: \"A Refined Formula for True Film LoversInspired by the New German Cinema sweeping through Berlin in the 1960s, our original Berlin Kino Film emulsion was an utter blockbuster. However, as German cinema evolved through time, adapting to meet the innovatory spirit of its founding fathers, so did our film formula. Refined and brimming with greater artistic control, the Berlin Kino B&W 400 2019 Formula will allow you to capture moments of your life in an eternalized enchanting monochrome. \"and the Potsdam: \"A Legendary Roll of German Cine Film RebornInspired by the New German Cinema sweeping through Europe in the 1960s, Lomography’s Kino Films are extracted from rolls of cine film produced by a legendary German company that has been changing the face of cinema since the early 1900s. Originally used to make moody monochrome movies, their gorgeous black and white tones lend a timeless effect to cinematic scenes.\"  Certainly attractive descriptions of the cine films that are produced by Orwo - N 74 Plus and UN 54:\"Product description: ORWO N 74 plus (Negative Film) is a high speed black-and-white panchromatic camera film for both outdoor and indoor usage. Its wide exposure latitude makes it especially suitable for use under low light illumination and difficult light conditions. Applications include documentary films, news coverage, underwater and industrial cinematography. Use of N 74 plus is also recommended under normal light conditions when greater depth of field is needed. The N 74 plus has improved slippage, extremely low shedding and excellent antistatic qualities.  Compare To: Eastman Double X (250 ASA)\"\"Product description:  ORWO Film UN 54 (Universal Negative) is a panchromatic medium speed black-and-white negative camera film for both outdoor and indoor usage. According to the ORWO Instruction 4185 the UN 54 film can be processed as black and white reversal film and be used to produce direct positives.   Compare To:  Eastman PLUS X (80 ASA)\"Now you see the difference between descriptions to two different audiences - the film hobbyist and the professional  cine film user.  Based upon the two different descriptions, which would you choose, not knowing they are the same product?  Lomography's, I am sure.   This is an example of many of the \"new\" films are coming to market for the 35mm shooter.  Whether it's from Lomography, Cinestill, Film Photography Project, Washi, or others - cine films are finding their way into the hands of avocational and hobbyist photographers, and it's all good.My experience with these films goes back a few years, as I received samples  of the ORWO N74 Plus and UN 54 films in 2016. I'll compare this latest batch of Lomo films with the ones that I received from ORWO.Lomography Berlin Kino 400 - As Lomography touts - \"Capture life’s most elusive moments in everlasting monochrome charm with the 2019 emulsion of our iconic black and white cine film.\"   I had not tried the earlier Berlin emulsion, so I can't comment on it.   Was the prior emulsion \"old stock\" from ORWO?  Hard to say, so it's all just conjecture, but my film cassettes do state \"New Improved Formula!\"   I bought them from B&H back in late 2019.  I love the packaging and the fact that Lomography provides developing information.   I shot my first roll in February in my FM3a,  and the second in my Nikon FE2 in June.  I compared those negatives with a roll of actual ORWO N74+ that I shot in 2016.  These are not the same films.  The N 74+ from 2016 has the typical cine sprocket perfs which are rounded, whereas the Berlin 400 2019 has standard 35mm squared-off perfs.  So, is the Berlin 400 I received something else, and NOT N74+?  Some research reveals that Filmotec (the branding for the ORWO cine film) released N-75 in 2019, with some improvements, rated at 400 ISO in Daylight, 320 ISO for Tungsten lighting.  It's also supposed to have  additional anti-halation undercoat (AHU).  That may explain the difference, as well as my 2016 film has \"Filmotec ORWO N74 813717 79A06\" in the film rebate. The Lomography film has no film information printed in the rebate.  I feel that the film base is quite dark and darker in the two Berlin rolls that I shot, whereas the ORWO N74+ has a lighter gray film base.  The negatives fit nicely into my scanner holder, without cupping or curling, so that is a plus.  Scan-wise, I think the results are very good, though there is some grain when developed in straight D-76.   The one thing I didn't care for was that Lomography uses a two-piece plastic cassette for this film.  I ended up prying it apart in the dark to remove the film, which isn't optimal.   So, I am fairly sure that the Berlin Kino 2019 emulsion is ORWO N75. Is the New Improved Formula batch that I received the same? That I do not know.Orwo N 74+ from 2016Berlin sample 2 with darker base, regular sprocketsBerlin sample 1 with dark base, regular sprocketsLomography Potsdam Kino 100 - Note that because this film can be developed as a negative or a positive film, it has quite a write-up on the Lomography site.   I have not processed it as a positive, but for a cine film, that is a real plus for those shooting the 16mm version.  I shot my first roll in February in my Nikon FM3a, and the second roll in my Pentax Spotmatic F in June. I compared those negatives to a roll of ORWO UN54 that I shot in 2016.  They all appear to be the same film, except that the ORWO has \"Filmotec ORWO UN54 512912 14A11\" on the film rebate.  I really like this film, as the scans are beautiful, and there is something about the tonality I really like.  The Potsdam film was developed in straight D-76 for 5 min 45 sec, and the UN54 was done in D76 1:1 for 7 minutes. Results are comparable. Standard metal cassettes are used for this film, or at least for the rolls that I purchased.Potsdam sampleUN 54 from 2016Overall impressions - I have other 400 ISO films that I like better than the Berlin 400. It's not bad, it's just that I am not liking the darker film base that to my eye, seems like base fog, and the more noticeable grain.  I much prefer Kentmere 400 and HP-5.  The Potsdam film reminds me a bit of Plus-X, and I do like its rendition of shadow areas.  Of the two, it's one that I would purchase again for landscape photography. As with any film - there will be people that find Berlin 400 or Potsdam 100 perfect for what they shoot, and others that won't like it as much as some other emulsion, which is one of the great things about shooting with film.  Try them yourself and see what you think.  It's also important to note that I give kudos to Lomography for providing more information on development, along with examples from different developers.  A few sample images - scanned with my Epson V700 scanner, post processed with Paint Shop Pro 64-bit.Berlin 400, Natural Bridge, VA Feb. 2020Berlin 400, Asheville, NC Jan. 2020Berlin 400, Natural Bridge, VA, Feb. 2020ORWO N74+, 2016, Nikon FGBerlin 400, NC, June 2020Berlin 400, NC, June 2020ORWO UN 54, Cranbrook, MI, Pentax K1000, 2016UN 54, MI, Pentax K1000, 2016Potsdam 100, Dutchess Co., NY, Feb. 2020Potsdam 100, Sharon, CT.

{"title": "Falling Back Into Love With 6x7", "date": "Sunday, June 14, 2020", "text": "A t-shirt that I have had for several years.Almost 20 years ago, my mentor, Bill Brudon, gave me his Pentax 6x7 kit. He said it was too heavy for him to use at his age (80-ish), and as I was in my 40s, I thought the camera was just fine. At the time I was all over the place with my photography, trying to figure out what I really liked, and working through all those wonderful cameras that came my way. The 6x7 was large and heavy, and I lugged that camera around in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, thinking that I had the perfect camera for landscape photography.  I took it on a trip to New Mexico in 2003,  and took a few good photographs with it.After a decade,  I hadn't used it as much as I thought I would, and lured over by the much lighter Rolleiflex and Hasselblad to a 6x6 format, the old 67 didn't see much use. At some point, and I don't remember when, the 6x7 had a mechanical problem, so I ended up selling all the 6x7 stuff I had. In 2014, I was selling the photographic gear of a deceased photographer, and ended up buying a Pentax 6x7 that lacked the battery cover (easily remedied with tape and cardstock).  The 90mm normal lens was all I had for some time, then I bought the 135mm macro lens for a lot less than I would have paid a decade earlier.  Over a year ago, I picked up a box of Pentax 6x7 accessories at a thrift shop for $10. Among the items were two Pentax close-up diopters for the 6x7, which obviously sell for a lot more.  This spring, I purchased the 55mm SMC Takumar lens - which is just what I needed to do landscape photography.  Now that I'm in the Appalachians, I know that the 55mm lens and the 90mm will be used quite a lot.  With the 10 negatives/roll of 120, I'll be more selective in my shots compared to using 35mm.  Yes, using a camera like the 6x7 does slow down my photography, and that's probably a good thing.To be honest, the Pentax 6x7 is a beast.  It's a bit ungainly, but not as much as a Mamiya RB67.  It's weighty (5 lb 6 oz), and at 63, I know that it's not the camera that I'll take on a hike in the woods.  However, the negative size is perfect, and I am finding so many interesting things to shoot here in NC.  It's all about the negative, though, and the 6x7cm negative has a lot to offer. I'll never be a large format shooter - it's just not my thing.  A Fuji 6x9 \"Texas Leica\" has some appeal to me, but the Pentax 6x7 has great lenses from wide to telephoto, and the SLR has many advantages over a 6x9 rangefinder camera. Not that I don't love the 6x9 format - I do, but 6x7 is really nice, too. For close-ups and macro work, the 6x7 excels, and somewhere in my files I have transparencies of that early work that I did.  I just did a bit of a look through my negatives from 2003, and here's one from the Guadeloupe Mountains near Carlsbad, NM.Nothing spectacular, but proof I was there, I guess.At this point, I'll be selling some items to acquire some Pentax 6x7 accessories -- a waist-level viewfinder, for one. Low-angle shots really require one.  I used to have the 200mm lens, which is great for portraits, so I just purchased one on eBay. I already have a lot of 35mm Nikon gear, so all of my Minolta SLR gear will be on the auction block soon.From 2002, UM Peony Garden, Fuji SuperiaThe Pentax 6x7 is definitely a camera that is well-suited for use with a tripod.  It makes it much easier to compose, and then use the mirror-lockup to not have to worry about mirror-slap vibration affecting the sharpness of the image.  I used to have that wood-handled grip, too, but I don't think I'll bother with finding one.   I look forward to spending more time with my Pentax 6x7 and getting back into the groove of using it regularly.Recent 6x7 work:Fomapan 100Fomapan 100Fuji Acros 100Fuji Acros 100Panatomic-X"},
{"title": "Monochrome Mania Issue 2", "date": "Sunday, May 31, 2020", "text": "When I set out to produce my photography zine, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted it to become. It's a creative outlet for me, as I had been involved in writing and publishing for my entire professional career, and also in my hobbies over the past 30 years. However, a photo zine is somewhat different  - yes - it's a vanity press, but it's a way for me to connect with people with photography, and to get my work in the hands of people at a price that's less than two lattes at a coffee shop.I had already seen a number of other photo zines, and I can tell you that like anything in photography, they represent a broad range of interests and subject matter. However, they are all out there because people want their work to be seen, on terms that they can control.  We are lacking in print outlets for a lot of photography. The plethora of photography magazines that existed 20 years ago have been decimated by the digital tsunami.  In addition, print publications depend on advertising revenue to be able to publish and pay employees.  Subscriptions fall, advertisers leave, and the print publication goes online -only, and then it may cease to exist altogether.  I am not an online magazine reader.  I like the physicality of a publication, and that it can be read anywhere, as an escape from the ever-present smartphone and computer screens.So, we now have many photographers that have something to say with their work, and  apart from some curated photography publications, nowhere to publish.  Back in the late 1980s, desktop publishing was just becoming a reality, with the software and laser printing that allowed press-ready work to be done by anyone.  That changed the way things like newsletters and small-market publications were done, not to mention the rest of the publishing industry. I was the editor of an entomological journal, and when I started, I sent physical manuscripts to the typesetters (which were typed in), and by the time I left that position, everything was a digital file, including illustrations, supplied by the authors, which were formatted for publication by the typesetters and sent to production. Now, the journal is only available online, and while I am sure that it saves the organization thousands of dollars, individual papers can be printed out by the user, if necessary.  So, what does that have to do with a photo zine, you ask? In my opinion, makers of photo zines are wanting to do exactly the opposite - those of us that produce photo zines recognize that the physical manifestation of an image may be as important as the image.  For those of us that use film - we already know that an image is a tangible thing. It exists whether we print it or not, as a negative or a slide. Yes, we can share it on social media, Flickr, and other online resources after we digitize it, but it may not have the same impact and audience that a print would have. People see an image for a few seconds on a screen, and click \"like\", and go on.  I think that those of us that produce zines want to do something more than that - we value the tangible, the permanence, and the physical attributes of the image.  Hence, we produce zines to showcase our vision, our interests, and to connect via the printed page. page 9, MM #2.I have had some requests for pdfs of my first Monochrome Mania.  It's still available in print. I'm not giving it away, but at $10, it's pretty cheap. No pdfs will be available, because they are made only to produce the printed copy.  I have so far limited production to 100 copies per issue, and when they are gone, that's it. You may think that only 100 copies is a small number.  If you had any image purchased by 100 people, you'd be really, really happy.  That's kind of how I look at it.  I produce Monochrome Mania as a sort of self-indulgent creative outlet.  This issue number 2 is very different from No. 1. Number 3 will be even more different, as it will be all about \"Toy Cameras.\"  Like other makers of zines, it is a way to share my passion about photography, and get it into your hands at a very low price. Issue Number 2 is Michigan Meanderings, and consists of photographs taken in various places in the state of Michigan. Having lived in Michigan for 37 years, I have visited most areas of the state, but seriously photographed places only since about 2006.  Some parts of the state have been shot extensively (Marquette, Ann Arbor), and I have lots more material for other future compilations. Nearly half of the photos in this issue were taken while my friend Marc Akemann and I were on photo trips together from 2008-2017.  I have dedicated this issue to his memory, and wish he were still alive to see it.  I am just about finished developing and scanning rolls of film that he left behind, and I have found a number of the rolls are from our joint trips.  That's a bittersweet experience, and maybe someday I'll be able to put some of them side-by-side with my images from those trips.Me, taken by Marc, June, 2013You can purchase Monochrome Mania No. 2 by going to the link on the right side bar, or by clicking here."},
{"title": "The Agfa Clack - a 6x9 gem", "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2020", "text": "I guess it is time for a little box camera love.  It's been a while since I have used a camera like the Agfa Clack, which is a 1950s camera that takes 8 6x9 cm negatives on a roll of 120 film.   The Clack is by no means a cheap plastic camera, as it has a stamped metal body with metal and plastic parts, and a glass meniscus lens. The Agfa Clack was manufactured in Germany from the mid-1950s  to mid-1960s, and apparently the later iterations featured a plastic body.  On first look, the camera has a vaguely oval shape, due to the curved back to reduce aberration in the images.  The features are pretty simple:Meniscus lens with two apertures - ca. f/13 and f/10Shutter about 1/30 plus BBuilt-in yellow filter  on some modelsClose-up lens for 1-3m distanceotherwise, focus is at  3m -infinitytripod socket centered on bottomsimple viewfinderred window with movable cover for frame numbercable-release socketBack in the days of big box cameras, it was routine to get contact prints back from your local drugstore when you dropped off your film, as 2.25 x 3.25\" (6x9 cm) prints are decent-sized, and the best shots could be sent out for reprints at a larger size.  If you understood the limitations of your camera and exposed properly, the Clack and many other box camera were adequate snap shot cameras. Today, such cameras are put into the \"Toy Camera\" category, but they really aren't toy cameras.  They were designed and produced at a higher price point than what would later become cheap plastic cameras with light leaks and lens aberrations. My goal with this particular Agfa Clack is to see how well it would work as a camera to take on local photo trips to see how it renders a scene.  The large negative is an obvious plus, as is the ergonomics of the camera. It handles much better than say, a Kodak Brownie 120 box camera.  For my use, I knew that the tripod socket, B mode, and cable release connector were just the things I needed to use the camera for landscapes in the NC mountains. My first roll was expired Kodak TMax 400, which I shot walking around Marshall, NC on May 1.  Hand holding the camera works pretty well, and the negatives (developed in D-96) looked pretty good.  The vertical shots were a bit blurred due to camera shake, but the landscape orientation was just fine. That encouraged me to take the Clack to Rocky Fork State Park in Tennessee 2 weeks later.  To photograph the creek, I rated the expired Tmax 400 at ISO 100, and the f/13 setting in the shady conditions gave me an exposure time of 1/2 sec or so.  That meant using the tripod and a cable release to shoot in Bulb mode. I estimated the exposure time and hoped for the best.  I developed the film in D-96, and am thrilled with the results.  From this, I know I can also put even slower films in it, such as Ilford Pan-F and Rollei Retro 80s.  The trick is to figure out the exposure with a light meter, and try and approximate it in B mode.  If it is sunny, I could tape a piece of ND gel over the lens for the longer exposure time.Marshall, NCMarshall, NC, Madison County seatRocky Fork State Park, TN.Rocky Fork State Park, TN.Rocky Fork State Park, TN.If anything, this exercise shows very well that one can overcome a camera's limitations with a little bit of care and planning.  I love the larger negative and look forward to shooting more riparian scenes with the Agfa Clack.  I have an Agfa Isola which makes 6x6 negatives and has features similar to the Clack.  I'll take it along, and see how it does in the same situations.  Maybe you have a 120 box camera in your collection. Don't be afraid to shoot with it!  Use ISO 100 film, as the cameras were made when Verichrome Pan (ISO 125) was THE film for box cameras.  Or, if you use a ISO 400 film, shoot on overcast conditions."},
{"title": "The Yashica Electro 35 CC", "date": "Saturday, May 23, 2020", "text": "Yashica produced quite an array of 35mm rangefinder cameras. In the early 1950s, they manufactured only twin-Lens reflex cameras, but expanded to 35 mm after they purchased the Nicca Camera Works in 1958. It wasn’t until about 1959 that Yashica produced 35mm rangefinders of their own design, starting with the Yashica YK.Yashica YK, circa 1959The early 35mm rangefinders were all fully manual, with the Lynx and Minister lines manufactured to about 1970. The Lynx and Minister cameras featured uncoupled meters and full manual operation, early models had selenium cells, and later models have CdS meter cells.Yashica Lynx 14E IC - circa 1969Yashica Minister III, circa 1966. Note the Selenium cells around the lens. With the Electro 35 series, starting in 1966, the cameras featured  CdS exposure metering, relatively fast 45 mm lenses, and electronic aperture-priority auto-exposure.  My early experience (between 2000 and 2012) with the Electro 35 series was not favorable.  All too often I encountered a camera that required a battery I could not find.  In some cases, a camera looked really great cosmetically, but was dead as a doornail mechanically.  In addition, I thought the cameras were bulky and finicky.  In the ensuing years, I learned about the PAD of death problem and the Yashica Guy that made battery adapters.  I think my biggest hangup with these cameras is that while they are aperture-priority, I have no indication of what the actual shutter speed is, and unlike a camera such as the Konica Auto S2, there is no manual mode available.  Yes, the Electro 35 series have a following, and many people liked them, but I was never a fan.Yashica Electro 35 GSN, post-1975. There has been a lot written about the Yashica Electro 35 series which I am not going to duplicate here. Over the years, many of the cameras became unusable due to lack of a proper battery and the PAD of death affecting many of them. Mike Elek has an excellent post on the PAD of death.  As for battery replacement, visit the Yashica Guy and order a battery adapter that will make your Electro 35 camera usable.As I previously stated, I was not a fan of the Electro 35 series.  However, in December, a very minty Electro 35 CC came my way that seemed to work. It doesn't need any battery adapter, allowing me to use a single 6v 4LR44 battery.  Now, the Electro 35 CC is a bit of a different beast compared to the Electro 35 GSN.  Stephen Gandy's Camera Quest site has an excellent review of the Electro 35 CC, and I have always been intrigued about this camera, but never saw one until now.  It sure is a pretty camera!What sets the Electro 35 CC apart from the rest of its line is the 35mm f/1.8 lens.  The Electro 35 series typically feature a 45mm f/1.7 lens, though the Electro 35 MC has a 40mm f/2.8 lens.  The 35 CC is also more compact the the rest.  I found an interesting error in McKeown's Cameras (page 1026) that lists the Electro 35 CC as having a 50mm f/1.7 lens.  The Electro 35 CC was sold from 1970-75, and is apparently one of the rarer models.  The original Electro 35 appeared in 1966, and the Electro 35 GSN was possibly the last model, as it appeared in 1975 and was sold into the early 1980s.Electro 35 CC features:Lens: 35mm, f/1.8, 6 elements in 4 groups.Shutter: between-the-lens, electronically controlled two-leaved type.Shutter Speeds: 8 sec - 1/250 sec.Exposure Meter: CdS cell located above front lens element, allowing metering with filters attached.Exposure Value Range: EV -1 - EV 16.Film Speed Range: ISO 25-500.Flash: PC socket, and only a cold shoe (why?).Focusing:  rangefinder-type.Viewfinder Information: Overexposure and slow speed indicatorFilm Advance: Manual, lever operated, single-stroke.Self-Timer: Mechanical, 10-sec. delay.Filter Mount: 52 mm.Battery:  6V PX28, or 4LR44 . Battery check illuminates frame counter if battery is good.  Lock button around shutter release to avoid accidental exposure.Dimensions: 120 x 74 x 59 mmWeight: 550 g.Finish of body: black only, no chrome models.My experience  with the Electro 35 CC was satisfactory, overall.  The rangefinder focusing was easy to see, and the relatively compact aspect of the camera made it a joy to use.  I think one has to use one of the Electro series for a while just to get used to the way they work with the over-under exposure arrows.  Since the maximum shutter speed on the Electro 35 CC is only 1/250 sec, I think using it with slower films is a good idea.  Of course, an ND filter could be used for high speed films.  It's certainly a camera deserving of some praise, in part because it does not require a battery adaptor, its compact size,  35mm focal length, and ease of use. I still wish the camera had a fully manual mode, but I will just have to accept it the way it is. It's about the size and weight of my Canon QL-17 GIII - in other words, compact and easy to carry around. It's also very quiet.Here are some sample images taken over the past few months. Black and white images were shot in Columbia SC on expired Plus-X; color images were taken in Columbia SC and Ashevill NC on Fuji Superia 200.I'll have to do more shooting with this cute, compact, and \"ever-ready\" camera.  I believe it has earned a place in my camera bag."},
{"title": "One Roll Review - Jazzy Blues ", "date": "Friday, May 15, 2020", "text": "Ultrafine Online  (aka Photowarehouse) has been selling some really off-beat films lately. My curiosity was piqued a while back, and I ordered a couple of rolls of their Jazzy Blues C-41 film.  From their online information - yes, everything would be rendered as a shade of blue, and the intensity depends on the exposure.  From their description:\"Based upon the premise of our popular Ultrafine Colouruption Films, comes a new hue, done in Blue. Another experimental Color Print Film that we have been shooting and having fun with here. Enjoy creating your own slow blues medley with this fine grain, standard C-41 process color print film. Very Slow. Can be shot at ISO 6, 12, up to 25.  C-41 Process. Fun and Experimental\"So, as an \"experimental film\" what should I shoot with it?  I loaded my Nikon FE2 with the Jazzy Blues film, and set it at ISO 25.  I carried it around while doing my normal shooting and eventually finished the roll.  I sent it into The Darkroom Lab for standard C-41 processing, and scanned the film myself on my Epson V700 scanner.First of all, the film appears to be on a Mylar base, and there is no orange C-41 masking as you would expect from a typical C-41 color film.  The negatives were yellow, so the emulsion appears to lack cyan and magenta layers.  It seems very fine-grained, so I am guessing that the film was originally used for some process in the cine industry. It's unlike any film that I have shot previously.While I shot it at ISO 25, I think that ISO 12 may have been a better idea, so my next roll will be shot at ISO 12.  It definitely is contrasty in direct sum, which is okay. One image from Ivy Creek Falls looks pretty darn good for a long exposure. When I played around with the histogram in post, I could achieve some VERY wild results. I did some histogram improvements before the scans, and some looked pretty good, others, not so much.  As an experimental film, it is a lot of fun to see what I got for the results.  It's pretty slow, so I suggest a tripod for the best results. trippy post effects can be achieved!Here are a bunch of images from my first roll. It's certainly an odd-ball kind of film, but if you are looking for something that's really outside the norm for shooting, you should give it a try.  At less than $5/roll for 36 exposures, it's a bargain for experimenting with.  It certainly ought to make portraiture interesting."},
{"title": "Send in the Clones", "date": "Tuesday, May 05, 2020", "text": "Many people are familiar with the Diana Camera, that cheap 1960-70s plastic camera that was made to be a promotional gift/prize. However, as we now know, the camera became an icon of photographic artistry, as seen by David Featherstone's The Diana Show (1980, The Friends of Photography, ISBN 0-933286-17-1), and Nancy Rexroth’s book, Iowa (1975, reprinted 2017, University of Texas Press, ISBN 978-1-4773-1041-0).   The vignetting, aberration, and peculiarities that varied from camera to camera made the Diana a cult camera. While the Diana does feature some modest controls, its overall construction is fairly flimsy, and certainly not as well-constructed as the much-later Holga. To remedy some of the aberration from the cheap plastic lens, the film mask was made to be about 4 x 4 cm on 120 film. The bonus was that gave us 16 negatives from a roll. You’d think that such an inexpensive camera would be ignored for what it was, but instead, several companies made clones of the camera.Hong Kong was the place where all the cheap cameras were made before China opened up to the World, and the Diana and subsequent clones, made in Hong Kong, represented the then lassiez-faire attitude towards copyright and trademarks. It’s possible that the same factory turned out most of the clones, but we’ll probably never know. The Great Wall Plastics Company in Hong Kong produced the Diana at least until about 1980, and it's safe to say that the concurrent clones probably lasted into the 1980s.While not at all in the same league as the collectible fake Russian Leicas, there are a number of people that do collect the Dianas and the at least 70 named copies provide a lot to explore. Being cheap plastic, the cameras don’t sell for a whole lot. Of course, there are modern Dianas, the Diana +, made by Lomography, that took the original design and improved upon it, and these should not be confused with the Hong-Kong variants. Until the Lomography-made Diana + came out, vintage Dianas were selling for over $50. I remember an estate sale that I was helping with in 2007, and the deceased hoarder had plastic bags of unopened original Dianas that he picked up at flea markets, etc. We thought that was quite the find at the time.  A few years ago, my friend Marcy Merrill sent me a box of Diana clones that she picked up at a camera swap.     Not all of the clones are identical in performance. The Lina and the Pokey have only a shutter button, with molded plastic tabs on the lens barrel that are there only to give the appearance of other controls, taking the craptastic quality to an even lower level.The original Diana (lower center) and clones. The 21st century Lomography Diana+is right above the original.What prompted this essay was my use of a Banier camera, so similar to the Diana, that it’s pretty much an exact copy. I had started a roll of vintage Verichrome Pan on it in 2018, and pulled it out of the drawer the other day and finished shooting the rest of the film. I developed the film in D-96 for 8 minutes, and the negatives came out very well. A few examples are shown below.Bill Schwab (center), Photostock 2018Saluda, NC 2020Saluda, NC 2020Fairview, NC, 2020Saluda, NC 2020If you are out shooting with a Diana or a clone  nobody will ever take you to be a serious photographer. However, as we know, it’s all in how you use the tools, and the Diana can be used to take some quite memorable and engrossing images.  The original Dianas are even better than the Holga if you want to pursue low-fi photography. As in \"better\", I mean more aberration, light leaks, and more “atmosphere.” The Diana + is certainly a better made and more reliable camera than the original, but it lacks the craptastic plastic uniqueness of the original.There are still many of these clones on eBay, and because of the Lomography Diana + and Diana-mini (which can make 24mm square negatives on 35mm film), the prices of the clones vary greatly.  New Diana+ cameras sell for more, and the older clones and original Dianas sell from $10 and up.    To get an idea of the names of Diana  clones, check out http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Diana.In short, there is a reason to use the Diana, and the results may be something that will lead you to explore how the camera affects not only the images you take, but the subsequent interpretation of them.  It's not always clarity of image that we  seek, but clarity of ideas, and the toy cameras can lead one down a path where reality is bent and shaped by a plastic lens.Michigan State Fair, 2006Protest, 2006Black Rocks, 2007flag, 2018King Cone, 2006Greenfield Village, 2008"},
{"title": "Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day 2020", "date": "Saturday, April 25, 2020", "text": "Fostoria, OH, WPPD 2016.Tomorrow, April 26, is the last Sunday in April, also known as Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day (WPPD).  There seem to be a lot of photo events on the calendar -- 'Roid Week, Toy Camera Day, Argust Day, World Photography Day, etc.  However, WPPD is a lot more organized, as it has a web site devoted to the day. I have participated off and on over the years, and this year, I definitely will be making some pinhole photos.  Unfortunately, the pinhole community lost Eric Renner, who died on April 9.  You may not know his name, but his book - \"Pinhole Photography - Rediscovering a Historic Technique\" (Focal Press) is an amazing book, and great resource for anyone wanting to know more about pinhole and zone plate photography.  He started pioneering work with pinhole cameras in the 1970s, and from the Freestyle Photo page -\"Mr. Eric Renner is the founder and co-director of Pinhole Resource, a nonprofit organization dedicated to sharing information about pinhole photography. He is also founder and co-editor of Pinhole Journal, published three times a year, and gives educational lectures and workshops internationally. Renner has worked in pinhole photography for 32 years. Some of his recent work in assemblages are made in collaboration with his wife Nancy Spencer. His photographs are exhibited in major collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the California Museum of Photography, the National Gallery of Canada, and Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris, France. Renner is the author of \"Pinhole Photography: Rediscovering a Historic Technique\"That short summary only tells a part of the story. Mr. Renner's work  is in many museums and collections, and his pioneering work with pinhole photography wasn't just about the mechanics and technique, it was also because he could tell a story with his photographs. I know that the first time anyone uses a pinhole camera, that person is truly amazed to get an image from something so primitive and non-technological as an oatmeal box with a tiny hole.  To take it to the next level - actually making an interesting photo and not that the photo is interesting because it was taken using a pinhole is a great achievement.  To be fair, the same argument can be made for a lot of photography.  Do you like a certain photo solely because of the process used to make it, or it it because of the intrinsic qualities of the image?  Most of us like a certain image because of what we see in it, how it affects us, or that we relate to it in some way.  The mechanical process of normal photography used to make the photo is far less interesting.  The thought process leading to the making of the image, however, is often of interest to us.  With pinhole photography, there is not only the making of the image, there is the making of the camera in a way that affects the image, so the entire process from the camera design to the final image is part of the thought process. I will say that pinhole photography, because of its mechanical attributes - long exposures, great depth of field, never fully sharp, but detailed images, and the odd effects that are a result of making almost any dark container a camera, can lead us to make photographs that are unlike any other process.  In that pinhole reality, people can accomplish amazing works that transcend time and physical constraints of the normal camera with a lens.  Eric Renner took pinhole photography from the status of a clever classroom exercise to an artistic photographic genre that is still relevant and exciting.  In Renner's book you'll see the work of a number of photographers, and I think that it can inspire others to try something new.  Yes, pinhole photography can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it, and it can show a \"reality\" that is not done with any other process. Pinhole photography may be the perfect medium for this COVID-19 mess that we are in. Social distancing, shuttered stores and restaurants, closed off parks and natural areas, and those stay-at-home suggestions could result in some creative spark that a pinhole camera image is the perfect for. Good luck tomorrow, and may your pinhole images be memorable!I'll be using my Hamm Camera Pinbox camera - a cardboard camera that uses 120 roll film.  So, I'm hoping for no rain. Here's an image from my first roll from the Pinbox, using Ultrafine's Extreme 100 film."},

Definitely not an ergonomic camera, but yet, it does work pretty well.  Also, when rewinding the film, hold the film catch button down while rewinding - which takes forever, because there is no crank, just a thin knurled knob.You can watch my Photo Notes Episode 2 on D-96.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDrzi6-qfVUHere are some photos of Asheville, NC, during our COVID-19 shutdown."},

Yes, they were made on the other side of the Iron Curtain, in Dresden, East Germany.  My first brush with a Praktica was around 2001, when I  bought a Praktica TL on eBay.  I had it for a few years, and enjoyed its simplicity and the fact that it used M-42 screw-mount lenses.    My next Praktica, in 2009,  was an early model, the FX-3, which was made in the late 1950s.By the mid-1970s, SLRs were extremely popular, and with the offerings of Pentax, Canon, Minolta, Nikon, and Olympus (and many smaller brands), there was much to choose from in an SLR system.  One thing all these cameras had in common was TTL metering.  The Praktica LTL (1970-75) did have TTL stop-down metering, and I find it interesting that the LB (1972-75) and LB2 (1976-77) utilized an external Selenium meter that was uncoupled.   The price point for the LBs must have been significantly lower, and perhaps aimed at beginners.  I just don't see how such a camera would have competed against Japanese-made SLRs at the time outside of the Communist Bloc.    I tried searching for 1970s Praktica SLR prices in US magazines, and the closest I could come was a 1981 price for a Praktica LTL3 (which did have TTL metering) with a 50mm lens for $107 at Cambridge Camera.   At that time, a Nikon FE body with a 50mm 1.8 lens was $310.  A Canon AE-1 with 50mm lens was $370.  Obviously, the Praktica was much cheaper, but also lacked any automation.So, what's one to make of the Praktica LB2?  The basic features of the camera are:Vertical metal-bladed shutter with B, 1- 1/1000 sec shutter speedsISO 6 - 1600 settings for meterexternal Selenium-celled, uncouple meter with match needle window on top deckISO flash shoe on prism1/125 sec flash sync1/30 sec sync for flashbulbfront mounted shutter releasetripod socketaccepts M-42 screw mount lensesI loaded up the LB2 with some Svema FN64 (from the FPP store) and took the camera along on several outings.  The front-mounted shutter release didn't take long to get used to, as it's actually very comfortably placed, and my index finger falls naturally on it.    The shutter has a nice chunk sound when it fires, and apart from the Selenium meter, it reminds me a bit of a Minolta SRT 102.  I used several lenses, the favorite being the Starblitz 28mm f/2.8.    I tried to use the metering of the camera as much as I could, though I may have just used sunny-16 a few times.  One disadvantage of that non-TTL meter is that filter factors need to be considered when using any filter, rather than having the meter compensate for them.In the end, while the LB2 is an odd-duck SLR, it does pretty well for such a low-budget camera.  In general, the Praktica SLRs are a step up from the Russian-made Zenits, and will deliver good results.  The prices on eBay have really gone up for the Prakticas.  In their heyday, they were never common cameras in the US, and some were rebranded by Hanimex and others for the UK market and elsewhere outside the Iron Curtain.  It was only after the fall of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany that the Dresden-made SLRs really became commonly available, and by then, M-42 mount SLRs (of which there are many brands from Japan, Germany, and the Ukraine and Russia) just were not popular, so they did not sell for much in the used market.  Now that film cameras have become more popular, the prices are 2-5 times what I would have paid 10 years ago. You certainly can buy a 1970s-80s Praktica SLR and a bunch of M-42 mount lenses and have a lot of fun shooting.  The vertical metal-bladed shutters are reliable, in my opinion, better than the cloth-based horizontal shutters that are found in the Pentax Spotmatics.Photo ResultsI developed the Svema FN64 in the FPP D-96 for 8.5 min at 20°C."},

{"title": "The Argus C-3 - The Infamous Brick", "date": "Wednesday, April 01, 2020", "text": "After over 15 years of blogging with Random Camera Blog, it's hard to believe that I, a former Argus collector/shooter, have not said much about the Argus Brick.  It's more than a chunk of Bakelite and Aluminum. It represents small-town industry and innovation.  It also represents the birth and decline of American-made products in the post-WWII era.  It represents the birth of 35mm color slides and amateur slide shows, and the post-war photography boom in America.  The Argus C-3 was never a beauty pageant winner, and its rugged homeliness is a throwback to when utility was favored over aesthetics, and the science of ergonomics had yet to be invented.The Origins of the Argus C seriesWhile Ann Arbor is known as the home of the University of Michigan, I imagine most people have no idea of the industry that was there nearly a century ago.  In 1931, the International Radio Corporation (IRC) was formed by a bunch of businessmen to build small radios for the home. Since this was in the Great Depression, it seems like it was a risky venture, but in fact, it was quite successful.  Summer months were apparently a less busy time for the company, and Charles A. Vershoor, the company president, decided that they could produce a small 35mm camera with the facilities already present at the IRC in Ann Arbor.  He apparently got this idea after seeing a Leica Model A while abroad in 1934.  The result was the Argus A, a fairly simple Bakelite-bodied 35mm camera with a rim-set shutter and plain viewfinder that appeared in 1936 - with nothing in common with the Leica except that it took 35 mm film.  The resulting sales were so successful that IRC sold its radio patents to RCA, and thus the company became the International Research Corporation, later changing to Argus, Inc. in the 1940s.While the Argus A series of cameras were successful, they lacked rangefinder focusing, and much like the Contax rangefinder camera, the design for \"the brick\" has a geared focus wheel on the front of the camera that is linked to the rangefinder.  However, the first model, the Argus C (1938-39), did not have the rangefinder linked to the lens focus, and one therefore had to read the distance from the uncoupled rangefinder and then move the focus distance on the lens barrel. The Argus C-2 also appeared in 1938, and has the rangefinder wheel coupled to the lens.  There was no flash linkage on these first two models, which was addressed by the C-3, appearing in 1939, with production continuing until 1966.  That was almost a 30-year reign for a camera, which of course, is unheard of today.  Because of the C, C-2, and C-3 models having some overlap, and the lengthy production run, there are many variations in the C-3, some retrofitted C-2s, and because Argus was often cash short, there can be oddities that pop up that vex collectors. Some of those may have been modification at the factory, or by users.Argus tried to continue with some basic form of the C-3 in the Argus C-33 (1959-61), Autronic 35 (1960-62), and Autronic II (1962-65).  None of these cameras were a big success. With the availability of much better cameras from Japan and Germany, and a more discerning and prosperous market, Argus sales steeply declined.  Argus barely clung to life into the late 1970s through a series of mergers and acquisitions and it ended its run as a company in 1985.  No cameras have been made in Ann Arbor since the early 1960s, and it's safe to say that the C-3 was the most popular 35 mm camera produced in the USA, with millions produced.  Argus made many more cameras than the beloved Brick, and the best compendium on the history of Argus and its cameras is the book Argomania (2005) by Henry J. Gambino (ISBN 0-9770507-0-X).  Unfortunately, it's out of print, but you may find a copy for sale online somewhere.  My favorite Argus camera is the C-4, which has a proper 35 mm rangefinder appearance, with a metal body and ergonomics that are enjoyable after using a C-3 for any length of time.A must-have, if you are into Argus!Argus C-3 VersionsThe first version (1939-1940) of the Argus C-3 came with 10 shutter speeds plus Bulb. The second variant (1940-42) has seven shutter speeds plus B, and was the last version before WWII.  The third variant (1946) was identical to the second, but has a coated lens, standard f-stop designations, and a black shutter cocking lever.The sixth variant (1955-56) has the \"Color-Matic\" settings such that the shutter speed dial, aperture dial and rangefinder dial are color-coded to match the \"Color-Matic\" settings.  The shutter was simplified to five speeds (1/10, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100 and 1/300), which remained for the run of the camera.  Further variations are pretty much cosmetic.  The \"Harry Potter camera\" -- an Argus C-3 Matchmatic (1958-66), has a two-tone leatherette and an EVS system that was supposed to simplify operation.  It also came with an LC-3 Selenium exposure meter.The C-3 Standard was manufactured from 1958-1966, and it looks a bit more dressed up than the previous versions.  That's probably the most common Argus C-3 that people will run into these days.  The lens is recessed from the front just a bit, and the dials and button look more polished.  However, it's a C-3, and is not functionally different from the first C-3 in 1939.My only remaining C-3s - both are usersMy history with the Argus C-3I picked up my first Argus, an Argus 75 box camera in the summer of 2000 at a thrift shop in Cheboygan, MI.  I didn't know squat about Argus cameras at the time, and I later picked up an Argus A and then a C-3 in 2001.  They were simply something interesting to try out, but then I started learning more about Argus, and that the cameras were made in Ann Arbor.  Once I found the Argus Museum at the site of the original factory, I was hooked into learning more about these cameras and started collecting them. So did my daughter Marjorie, and between the two us us there were probably close to 50 Argus cameras in the house at one time.  At that time, in the early 2000s, Argus cameras were dirt cheap.  After all, with digital becoming a big thing, those old Argus cameras could not have been worth anything!  So, we managed to acquire some rare models and pretty much all the variants in the C series. All of my rare Argus cameras were sold quite a while ago, and except for a few models, I gave the remaining Argus cameras to the Argus Museum before I moved to North Carolina  in 2019.A few of the Argus C series that went to the Argus MuseumI kept two C-3s.  One is a third variant, and the other is a sixth variant.  Both work very well, and one has a 35 mm Argus Sandmar wide-angle lens instead of the standard 50mm f/3.5 Argus Cintar.What's that, a 35 mm lens?  Yes, the Argus C-3 is capable of using other lenses made for it.  It's not a quick process, but Argus sold the 35 mm Sandmar lens and a 100 mm f/4.5 Tele-Sanmar lens.  Soligor and Fuji also made lenses for the C-3.One of the wonderful things about Argus cameras is that aside from being popular in the USA, there were a number of companies that made accessories for them. Collecting such items is quite a feat by itself: close-up filters, series filter holders, flash guns, close-up kits, underwater housings, etc. can be found, though I suspect that what used to be fairly common has now become hard to find as a lot of such accessories were probably tossed in the trash.Using an Argus C-3 While I only occasionally use an Argus of any kind these days, I know that if I pick up a C-3, I can get good images from it. If the camera is in good working order, the lens clear, and the rangefinder accurate, you should be able to take very good photographs. In fact, I challenge you to find a better-US-made 35mm camera from that era that still works as well as when new. It's not going to be in the same ballpark as German-made cameras such as the Kodak Retina II, but it was far more affordable at the time.  An Argus C-3 can be ideal for long-exposures, and I have used one to take urban night shots.Mark Dalzell, holding the Giant Argus C-3 at the ArgusMuseum in Ann Arbor.

If anything, there were more errors in my film processing than in the operation of the camera. I have to say, I thought a share of the negatives were pretty good, and if you are looking for a cheap 35 mm camera with full manual control, the C-3 should be considered.A few things I wish Argus had done differently:Strap lugs.  Argus isn't alone in this, but it would have been nice to have strap lugs on the camera body, and not to have to use the leather case with a strap.  I'm not a fan of ever-ready cases. A faster lens. A maximum aperture of  f/3.5 isn't great, and f/2.8 would have been nice.  However, based upon the lens design, it would certainly have made the camera more expensive, and bulkier than it already is.A better system of attaching the back!While its easy to talk about the shortcomings of the Argus C-3 in the year 2020, one should think about just what was available to the amateur photographer in the USA in 1942.   First of all, large format and medium format was the realm of professional photographers.  The cameras that used 127 film were mostly aimed at the occasional photographer, and box cameras that used 620/120/127  in the USA were aimed at the beginners and household photographers.  The “miniature” format of 135 film was really just getting popular, but it offered more control and less to carry around.  The cameras, however, were relatively expensive.  If one wanted to pursue 35 mm, the Argus C-3 was probably the most quality at an affordable price.  The Argus A series (starting in 1936) certainly made 35 mm affordable, but it was the C-3 that gave professional results.  Once war started in Europe, the German-made cameras became much more difficult to acquire, and the Argus was the obvious choice in the USA.   It wasn't until after the war ended, that the post-war 35 mm photography boom really got going, and while there were many American camera manufacturers, none of them sold  cameras as dependable as the Argus C-3.  Kodak was the exception, and its German-made Retina series cameras were a far better, more compact, and also more expensive option.  The Kodak Pony, originally made for 828 film, became a 35 mm camera in 1950, but it lacked rangefinder focusing.  The Kodak 35 Rangefinder (1940-42, 1946-51)- perhaps the most ungainly-looking camera ever, lacked the ruggedness and simplicity of the Argus C-3.  The earliest models lacked flash synchronization, and the camera was always more expensive than the C-3.In today's dollars the C-3 would be about $675!Speaking of WWII, the American photographer, Tony Vaccaro, served as an Army Infantryman, and carried his Argus C-3 throughout his service.  His photographs were taken as a soldier, and it wasn't until 50 years after the war ended, that he exhibited them.   There is no doubt that the rugged and easily repaired C-3 served him well, and his images show the stark reality of the war from D-Day until Germany surrendered.    There is an excellent HBO documentary (2016) -  Under fire. The untold story of PFC Tony Vaccaro. It's available online now.You can still use a C-3 today.  They are great for making multiple exposures as you can cock and fire the shutter without advancing the film.  As I said above, if the camera is in good mechanical and optical condition, it will do as well as the person using that is using it.  There is something about using a 60-80-year old 35 mm camera in 2020.  While it's easy to poke a bit of fun at The Brick, it paved the way for a generation of photographers.Some sample images from my C-3 cameras over the years2008 Argus Day Meetup"},
{"title": "Twin lens reflex cameras", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2020", "text": "Twin-Lens Reflex - Why?For many film shooters, their first introduction to medium-format (120 film) was often via a Twin-Lens Reflex camera (TLR). While there are a lot of cameras that use 120 film, a TLR is certainly one of the cheapest ways to get square format negatives, if you disregard the Holga.  There is something about square format that I find attractive, and it can be a creative boost if you have never tried it.First of all, why use a TLR anyways?  TLRs have several advantages over Single-Lens Reflex cameras, especially in medium format. When you focus on your subject with a TLR, there is no momentary blackout when the shutter fires, as there is in an SLR.  With no mirror to flip out of the way, you can see if the model blinked or moved as the shutter fired.  The leaf shutter in a TLR is very quiet, as there is no mirror slap and other noises that you get with most SLRs.TLRs have a viewing lens and a taking lens.  They are optically matched so that what you see in the viewfinder matches what the taking lens covers.  Because they are square format,  the typical \"normal\" focal length is 80mm (approximately equal to 50 mm in 35 mm), though there are TLRs with 75 mm or 85 mm lenses.  Most TLRs have a fixed focal length lens, so no matter what manufacturer you choose, they will typically be in that range of 75 mm-85 mm. However, Mamiya has a removable lens system that enables the C220 and C330 models to use lenses ranging from 55 mm - 180 mm. For each focal length, the viewing and taking lenses are mounted on a lens board that snaps onto the front of the camera.  The focusing is accomplished with a bellows that racks in and out with the lenses at the front.  Since all medium-format TLRs have shutters in the taking lens, each lens unit is self-contained.  While my Mamiya C330 Pro is a wonderful TLR, it's also much heavier and bulkier than say, a Rolleicord or YashicaMat.  However, the flexibility of being able to use a wide-angle or short telephoto with a square format is a lot of fun, and much cheaper than going the route of a Hasselblad SLR.My Mamiya C330 f Professional with some lensesFilm Format - 6x6 cm on 120 film (there is no such thing as 120mm film), and in some models, also 220 film (same as 120 but with twice as much film and only paper backing on the leading and trailing ends).   There are 12 exposures per roll with square format. Since the format is square, you don't need to worry about portrait or landscape orientation.  Some US-made TLRs such as the Kodak Reflex and the Argus Argoflex use 620 film, which means that you'll have to respool 120 onto 620 spools to use those cameras.    Peter Gowland, the famous glamour photographer, designed the Gowlandflex- a beast of a TLR that took 4x5 and an even larger 8x10 model.   There are also some fine TLRs that take 127 film - The baby Rolleiflex, the Yashica 44,  and the Sawyers Mark IV.  It's unfortunate that 127 film is defunct because those cameras were, in my opinion, the best for shooting that film.  There are a few 35mm cameras that are twin-lens reflex, but the images are not square, and not germane to this discussion.TLRs became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, and while Rolleiflex is the most well-known of the TLRs, many manufacturers made them, and I'll touch on some of them later on in this post.  The Rolleiflex was one of the cameras used by a lot of news photographers, well into the 1960s, due to the larger negative. However, the advantages of 35mm SLRs with a wide lens assortment, motor drives, and ease-of -use soon had those Rolleiflexes sitting on a shelf.  For street photography, a TLR is a great camera, and of course, we have many images by Vivian Maier and Diane Arbus that prove that point.  TLRs are also excellent for portrait photography, and models such as the Mamiya C-series are perfect for studio photography.Things to watch forSimple reflex mirrorA TLR operates with a permanently fixed mirror behind the viewing lens, so while the subject will be right-side up, it will be reversed in viewing. Left is right, right is left. That can be a bit confusing at first, but you quickly adjust to it.  Older cameras, especially cheaper models, will often exhibit some loss of clarity in viewing due to several factors - mirror de-silvering, dust on the mirror, grime on the ground-glass, as well as dirt and haze in the viewing lens.  It's been my experience that the least expensive TLRs have the worst focus screens.  Outdoors, those dim screens may not be so bad, but nothing beats a quality fresnel screen and a clean mirror.Waist-Level ViewingAll TLRs have been designed to use \"waist-level\" viewing of the ground glass.  Typically, there is a pop-up hood to shield the ground-glass from ambient light. The finders usually have a pop-up magnifier attached to the bottom of the top cover that flips up for critical focusing.  Many, but not all, have the ability to be used with a \"sports finder\" where there is a small square on the back piece of the viewing hood, and the front (or top of the hood) has a push down square cutout that allows you to use the camera at eye level for subjects at infinity, and to also be able to pan a shot with a moving object.Several TLR cameras such as Rolleiflex and the Mamiya C-series have removable waist-level finders and replacement eye-level prism finders. While they are great for many situations, they make the cameras bulkier and much heavier.  Another advantage of the prisms is that they provide a clear view without ambient light reflecting off the ground-glass.Waist-level finder, Yashica Mat 124Mamiya C330 with eye-level prism finderParallax CompensationAt close distances, parallax compensation becomes an issue.  TLRs with a normal lens on the 80mm range usually do not focus closer than 3.5 feet.  There may be a slight difference due to the small difference in height of the viewing lens at the closest distance.  With a TLR such as the Mamiya C-series there is the ability to focus closer than that, with an obvious difference due to parallax.  The C330 has two ways to compensate - one is an indicator in the viewfinder of where the top of the frame will be, and the other is a device called the Paramender.  The TLR is mounted on the paramender, and when ready to fire the shutter, the paramender is adjusted so that the taking lens will be at the height of the viewing lens.  Obviously, this is not a problem with an SLR.Shutter speedsWhile any pro-level TLR will have a full range of shutter speeds from B to 1/500 sec, many low-end TLRs have a more limited range.  If your TLR has a max shutter speed of 1/200 sec, it may limit your choice of film, though to be honest, I have used 400 ISO film with no problems.    My Yashica A TLR has B, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100 and 1/300 sec.Shutter speeds on a rim-set shutter, Ciroflex TLRMaximum ApertureIt's rare to have a TLR with a wider aperture than f/3.5.  The obvious exception is the Rolleiflex 2.8.  At f/2.8, there is a noticeable difference in depth of field, but also a stop faster, which makes the Rolleiflex 2.8 quite desirable, and of course, very expensive.  Cheaper TLRs may have a f/4.5 maximum aperture.Film Winding and frame indicationLoading film in a Ciroflex TLRThe film in a TLR travels vertically, of course, moving from the lower film chamber, past the film gate and then to the take-up spool in the top of the camera. Many less-expensive TLRs use the red-window on the back to indicate the frame, but cameras with cranks such as the Rolleiflex,  YashicaMat and Mamiya C-series, use a window on the side of the camera that gives you the frame number.  It makes for a much faster and accurate film advance.The knob on the upper L is the film advance. Ciroflex TLRCrank-type film advance, Yashica Mat 124It's not a big deal to use the red window, and don't let that deter you from using cameras such as the Yashica A or the  Ciroflex and Graflex 22. In addition, if your TLR uses a red window to show the frame number, then you can usually also do multiple exposures, as the shutter is not controlled by the film advance.The red window. There is a button below it to move a cover to prevent fogging in bright sunlight.Controls The things you need to control are focusing, shutter speed and aperture.Most TLRs focus by turning a knob on the side that moves the front lens board in and out. The Minolta Autocord and Meopta TLRs use a front mounted lever that does this. Cheaper TLRs such as the Argoflex, Ricohflex, and others use geared taking and viewing lenses that move the lens helical in and out with a fixed lens board.  I don't really care for that type of focusing, but if you want to go cheap, that's what you'll get.geared helical on an Argoflexlensboard moves in and out on better TLRsAperture and shutter speed are set either by levers on either side of the taking lens (rim-set shutters), or by small geared wheels with a window above the viewing lens that is visible when you look down form the top of the camera.  The majority of TLRs do not have built-in light meters, but some have selenium light meters or CdS battery-powered light meters.  However, a hand-held meter or even sunny-16 works well with TLRs.Yashica Mat 124, just like a Rolleiflex. Also note thelight meter on the right front.Controls around the taking lens on a CiroflexSome older TLRs may require you to cock the shutter after having set the shutter speed, and others may have just a simple shutter lever that does not require cocking.  Cranking TLRs cock the shutter as you advance the film.FlashYou can't put a flash on top of a TLR like you do an SLR for obvious reasons.  If there is a flash shoe, it's mounted on the L side of the body. There may also be a PC flash socket on the front of the lensboard or around the side of the rim-set shutter.  In any case, the best way to use a flash with a TLR is to have a flash bracket that attaches to the tripod socket so that the flash sits up higher and the camera is easier to handle.  Because these cameras have leaf shutters, you can use flash at any shutter speed.AccessoriesYou'll often find lens hoods and filters and even accessory lenses available for many models, especially those that have been used professionally such as the Rolleiflex and Mamiya C-series.  Typically, they are bayonet-mount and are called Bay series.  For many other TLRs, you may find that the taking lens has no filter thread, so you'll need to find slip-on filter holders that are made for series 6 filters.  See my early posts about series filters and the adapters.Lens hoods are especially useful to prevent flare, and I highly recommend using them with TLRs.  Some are square, but round ones can also be used.  Here's examples of both types.  Typically, you'll need to find a slip-on adapter ring that's 31.5mm in diameter with series 6 or series 5 on the outer end to accept the screw on lens hoods and filter rings.Long Exposures All TLRs have a tripod socket on the bottom.  While it's pretty easy to hold a TLR with a neck strap for 1/15th sec exposures, it's a good idea to have a tripod for longer exposures.  Since these TLRs have waist-level finders, you don't have to have a tall tripod.  Additionally, a short cable-release is a good idea if your camera accepts one.  Some TLRs have T and B for long exposures, and since the shutters are leaf shutters, there is little vibration.  They are great for slower films and capturing the beauty of moving water.Some TLR RecommendationsRolleiflex - Of course.  The most common and affordable is the Automat, which was produced in several versions from 1937-1952.  Franke and Heidecke produced the first Rolleiflex in 1927, and continued manufacturing various models of the Rolleiflex until about 2014.  There are many sites devoted to Rollei, so I suggest that you start here to know more.  I owned a late-version Automat with an f/3.5 lens and still regret selling it.    The Rolleicord models were less expensive \"amateur\" models sold from the late 1930s to 1977, and very popular.     The Rolleiflex cameras are complex mechanical marvels, and repair experts can be hard to find these days.  The cameras became immediately more expensive on the used market after Rollei GMBH stopped manufacturing.Rolleiflex Automat RolleicordYashica TLRsYashica made a LOT of TLR models, and the simpler winding knob advance models such as the Yashica A are fairly inexpensive, even today.  They use a red window for frame number, and some models have more features than others.  I paid $30 for my Yashica A, and it's been a reliable and decent TLR for me.    There are many models, so I'll refer you to the TLR site for more information.The Yashica Mat 124 and 124G are highly desirable cameras with metering, crank advance, and were made into the 1980s, so they are relatively young.    My Yashica Mat 124 is relatively new to me, and I'll be shooting with it a lot this year.Minolta AutocordMinolta made several models of TLRs and all have a good reputation.  I have never used one, but I expect that the later models are pretty similar to a good Rolleiflex and the yashica Mat 124.  Meopta FlexaretThese Czech-made cameras are very good. I once had a Flexaret VII and found it easy to use and very well-made.  Argus Argoflex EIt's at the bottom of my list, but it does take 120 film.  Its Bakelite body is not too different from the Voigtlander Focusing Brilliant as well as the infamous Lubitel 66, which is a copy of the Voigtlander TLR.  Not exactly bad, but not great, either way.Argoflex E, Bakelite bodied TLR (1940-48)Of course, there are many dozens of other TLRs from various manufacturers. As a subgroup of cameras, they present an opportunity for endless eBay searches and flea market finds.  Of those, the Ricohflexes are probably among the cheap end and will still give relatively good results, even though they are not the best of the lot.another geared focus TLRThe American-made Ciroflex TLRThe Ciroflex TLR is quite possibly the best example of an American-made TLR.  The Ciro Co. started in Detroit, and began manufacturing the cameras in Detroit, MI in late 1940.  Of course, the first model was the Ciroflex A.  With WW II, manufacturing slowed to a halt until after the war, and Ciroflex relocated to Delaware, OH in late 1946, early 1947.  The first ads for the new Ciroflex D and E appeared in November 1948.  The Ciroflex F, the ultimate model, appeared in late 1949.  In 1952, Graflex acquired Ciro, and moved the manufacturing to Rochester, NY.  The new cameras were called the Graflex 22, and the designation 200 meant that was the maximum shutter speed, essentially the same as the Ciroflex D.  The Graflex 22-400 was the same as the Ciroflex F, with a 1/400 sec  max. shutter speed, and flash shoe on the side. The end of the Graflex TLR came in 1957. That means any Ciroflex or Graflex TLR is going to be over from 62-75 years old.  So, finding one in pristine condition is going to be difficult.Ciro also made the DeJur Reflex, which was essentially a Ciroflex D.  The Ciroflexes are generally well-constructed and originally sold for less than $70 - which was certainly not a cheap camera, but was definitely cheaper than a Rolleiflex.  They have metal bodies, take 120 film (a definite plus over the majority of the Argoflexes) and are generally quite reliable, despite being over 60 years old.Ciroflex DThe models are fairly similar (A,B,C,D,E, F), the main difference being the shutter.  All have a focus knob that moves the lensboard in and out. There is a red window on the back to determine what frame your exposure is on. Cameras with Wollensak Alphax shutters have speeds up to 1/200 sec and the shutter does not need to be cocked to fire.  Cameras with Rapax shutter have a maximum of 1/400 sec. And there is a separate cocking lever and firing lever.  A separate remote release connection is on the side of the shutter. The taking lens is almost always an 85mm f/3.5 Velostigmat lens, except for the Model F, which has an 85mm f/3.2.Use 120 filmThe most common problems with these older TLR are with the mirror becoming either oxidized or tarnished, which can be remedied by replacing it with a new first-surface mirror of the same thickness.  In general, the Alpax and Rapax shutters are reliable, though the shutters may have problems at slower speeds, but generally, 1/25 and faster are going to be okay.  The groundglass may also need cleaning after so many years.    With a bit of a tune-up, these TLRS may perform just great for years to come. My Graflex 22 has a fresnel groundglass, which might have been installed later.While the Ansco Automatic Reflex was the most technically brilliant American-made TLR, it was also very expensive and not entirely reliable.  The Argus Argoflexes were fairly crude but usable TLRs that mainly accepted only 620 film. The exception is that the Argoflex E does accept 120 film.The Ciroflex remains the winner here.  It is a reliable, durable, and accessible TLR.  Prices online vary a great deal, but a common model such as the Ciroflex D can often be had for less than $60.  The Ciroflex F, with its flash-synced shutter and subtle changes, go for much more.   The Graflex 22 models generally sell for between $35 and $75. With the gray leatherette, they are quite attractive cameras, and of course, the “newest.”  For more on the American-made TLRs, check out Rick Oleson’s site.Pseudo TLRsKodak Duaflex seriesYou have obviously seen them - The Argus 75, the Kodak Duaflex, Anscoflex, etc., and they look like a TLR camera. However, consider them to be box cameras with a reflex viewer. There is no focus linkage between the taking and viewing lenses.  Even a cheap Ricohflex with geared coupling between the lenses will be better than these box cameras.  However, that doesn't mean that you can't get some interesting photos with them - they will give you whatever one would get with a box camera, and some of these models have additional settings that will give you the ability to control your exposures.  I think that the ability to take square images is what sets them apart from the other crappy cameras of their time. The Argoflex 40 or Argus 40 is one such model, though it does demand 620 spools.  Some of the pseudo-TLRs take 127 film, but most of them are 620 film cameras.  Collecting them can be a quest all by itself, as there are quite a few different models, and they usually are fairly inexpensive. Here are a few examples.  The Argus 75 has been reviewed by me years ago, and remains  my most viewed blog post!127 film - crappy Clix-o-flexAnscoflex I and IIArgus 40 with adjustable aperture, shutter speeds andzone focus.Argus 40 brilliant viewfinderThe crappy Insta FlashThe lovely Bolsey-Flex.

{"title": "Some Thoughts at a Strange Time", "date": "Thursday, March 19, 2020", "text": "First Day of Spring, 2020Well, today marks the vernal equinox, and it is my first spring in Western North Carolina. Due to the COVID-19 virus, this has to be the oddest spring that I can remember. Of course, here at my house, we are pretty much keeping to ourselves as we usually do.  Retirement is the perfect time to be able to not have to do anything, but I feel for those that have kids home from school, the people who have to work, and endure the anxiety and uncertainty that this pandemic has caused. It really is unprecedented in the modern era. The rapidity of how things have gone topsy-turvy has amazed me.  No more eating out or going to a bar for a pint in the afternoon (which of course, is a minor thing to us, but no so much for the restaurant industry). The tailspin of our financial markets doesn't surprise me in the least, as I have felt that it's a house of cards for the past 3 years. I am not sure where this will all end up, but I can only hope that efforts to reduce the impact of the virus will have the desired effect, and that the lock-down of our society is only a short hiccup.  However, I do think that the ramifications of what's transpired over the past month (and in future months)  will remain with us for some time - the fragility of our health care system, the gutting of our governmental acuity and the lack of resources to those that need it the most.  It's hard to not have dark thoughts these days, and art isn't immune to these events -- it's often a mirror of the time.It's a bit trite to say \"go lose yourself in what you love to do in these times.\" I do get it it -- \"go do photography and forget about the troubles of the world.\"  Except that it's not that easy when the troubles are everywhere, not somewhere else.   So, while I can't ignore the current state of affairs, I can try and at least do what I love, and buffer the events a bit.  I generally don't write about current events in RCB, but I think we are all a bit overwhelmed by it all.So, what about photography?What I have been doing of late is going back and scanning in b&w negatives from 2008 and earlier.  I'm working on another issue of Monochrome Mania, and I found that I had some really good images that were from rolls that were never scanned in, save for a couple of frames.  One thing that I have found is that you should never think that the scans you did a long time ago are going to be satisfactory later on. This is due partly to better scanners and software, but also due to changing attitudes and how we view our work over time.  In the museum world, it's a fact that changing technologies mean that digital images will be replaced with better versions every decade.  However, that's only part of the story.From my own experience, I know how easy it is to see a fresh set of images where I connect with the immediacy of the day that I took them.  It doesn't matter whether they are digital-borne or scanned from a freshly developed set of negatives, there is a connection to the event of the making of the images.  That connection often influences our evaluation of the images.  Do you remember when you shot your first roll of film and developed it yourself?  I know I was in high school, and though by my standards today, they were not very good images, at the time, I thought they were great.  It can also be the reverse - in 2008, I shot a lot of film while on a trip to Sleeping Dear Dunes with my buddy Marc Akemann.  We were attending our first Photostock event in Emmet Co., MI, and we took a day to go to Ghost Forest of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.  I shot several rolls of film there that day. One of the rolls was Kodak Technical Pan film, and I don't remember how I developed it - though I suspect is was in Technidol developer.  The negatives were thin and there were lots of spots on them.  I don't think I thought they were very good, and I had other rolls shot from there on APX 100 that I liked much better. Anyhow, I know that at the time, my scanner was not as good as I have now (Epson Perfection V700 Photo), and after scanning in the Tech Pan negatives, I saw many that were really very good images.  After spending a few minutes cleaning up this one negative, I love how the ghost forest looked ghostly.The ghostly ghost forest. Lensbaby lens, N8008, Kodak TechPan. 2008.I'll have to have this one printed digitally, as a traditional optical print would be one big pain in the ass to spot and clean up.A quite different image. Nikon FE, APX 100 film. 2008.Going back to these older sheets of negatives has allowed me to go on a bit of memory lane as well, and also drove home that I have a LOT of sheets of negatives that I haven't looked at in some time.  If I estimate that on average, I shot a minimum of 100 rolls per year for the past 20 years, that's 2000 sheets of negatives.  Of course, not all of those are worthy of rescanning, but there are lots that I need to look at for material for upcoming zines!So, to summarize:It's a good thing to go back and look at images you shot long enough ago that there is no longer an emotional connection to the event of shooting the image. If an image is good, it transcends that connection, and creates a new one - an appreciation of the image itself, not of the event it's associated with.Review your old work and learn from it.Re-scanning with better tools and software is a good thing when you can do it.Our perception of our own work changes with time, and we can get motivated by looking at earlier work we've done.  Maybe it was the camera, the film, the lens, or your vision that helped make an image something truly special.  How has that changed?Be well, be safe, and document this crazy world.  I hope that you can look at images from 2020 in 2025 and find some images that showed what made the year so special."},
{"title": "The Wirgin Edinex  - so many Wirgins!", "date": "Thursday, March 12, 2020", "text": "Germany produced many different camera manufacturers and it's just amazing that so many interesting cameras were designed and manufactured there before and after WWII.   Apart from popular names like Leitz and Zeiss, there were many manufacturers that produced quite good photographic equipment.  Many of the companies started in the 1920s, and had mixed success after the end of WWII.  With the creation of East and West Germany,  things became even more complicated with naming and branding. With VEB Pentacon in Dresden and Zeiss moving to Stuttgart, there became two major productions of Zeiss-named cameras.  However, the Zeiss in Jena became Pentacon to avoid trademark infringements in the West.  Zeiss Ikon became the West German manufacturer.  On top of all that Zeiss Ikon incorporated a bunch of other companies in the late 1920s, such as Ernemann, Goerz and Ica.  It's a confusing mess without some sort of guide.  However, it bears repeating that if you want to delve into collecting German cameras, restricting yourself to Leitz is pretty boring, if not expensive.Wirgin Edinex (0)Some German companies, such as Agfa, produced films as well as cameras.  Some, such as Voigtlander go back to the early days of photography (i.e., the Petzval lens was designed in 1840), and the names have outlived the German factories that made the photographic equipment.  The myriad of cameras that were produced in Germany in the 20th century is astounding, and if you look through a tome such as McKeown's Cameras (at over 1200 pages), you could spend a long time just looking at German-made cameras.  You'll see Adox, Agfa, Balda, Beier, Bentzin, Bilora, Braun, Bulter, Certo, Contessa, Dacora, Diax, Eho-Altissa, Erka-Kamerewerk, Ernemann, Finneta-Werk, Foitzik, Foth, Foto-Quelle, Franka-Werk, Futura Kamerawerk, Genos, Gerlach, Glunz, Goerz, Goldammer, Huttig, ICA, Ihagee, Iloca, Kamera Werkstatten, Kenngott, Kochmann, Krauss, Krugener, Kunik, K.W., Leidolf, Leitz, Linhof, Lippische, Mentor, Merkel, Mimosa, Minox, Montanus, Nagel, Neithold, Nettel, Orionwerk, Pentacon, Plaubel, Porst, Regula, Rietschel, Robot, Rodenstock, Rollei, Ruberg & Renner, Steinheil, Voigtlander, Vredeborch, Welta, Wirgin, Wunsche, Zeh, Zeiss,  and Zeiss-Ikon.  Some of them you have undoubtedly heard of, but others are  relatively obscure names outside of Europe.    The manufacturers Balda, Ihagee, Pentacon, Voigtlander, Welta, Wirgin, and Zeiss-Ikon produced a dizzying array of different cameras. Wirgin began in Wiesbaden, Germany  in the 1920s and started producing cameras in the 1930s.  To escape the Nazi persecution of Jews, the Wirgin brothers fled Germany to the US  around 1938.  The factory was largely destroyed during the war, and camera production restarted in 1948, after Henry Wirgin returned to Germany and restarted the company.  The company went bankrupt in 1968.  Wirgin made about 150 different camera models, with a confusing number of similarly-named 35mm rangefinders and SLRs.  The company also made 16 mm subminiature cameras, 120 folding cameras, plate cameras, stereo cameras, as well as a number of zone-focus 35 mm cameras, such as the Edinex, which I am reviewing here. The Wirgin Edinex (0)McKeown's lists the early basic Edinex models as type 0, as there are typically no distinguishing names on the models until the Edinex 1 was produced in 1951.  The Edinex cameras are surprisingly small due to the telescoping lens tube, rim-set leaf shutters, and compact metal body that opens from the bottom for film loading.   They lacked a built-in rangefinder until the Edinex III appeared.  There is a tubular post on the top deck of the camera that accepts an accessory rangefinder.   My Edinex probably dates from about 1948-1950, as it has a 5 cm Schneider Radionar f/2.9 lens set in a Compur-Rapid rim-set shutter with T, B, 1 - 1/500 sec.   Focus is made by turning the front lens cell, which focuses from 3.5 feet to infinity.  The viewfinder is tiny, and not ideal for anyone wearing glasses.Using the cameraFirst, to load film in the camera, you rotate the release on the bottom plate, which comes all the way off. There is not much space between the pressure plate and the film transport, so you have to carefully load the film.  I had to tape the film leader into the metal removable -take-up spool and carefully guide it all into place.  To advance the film you must turn a small rotating disk to the left edge of the film winding knob. The arrow shows the proper direction, and once the film starts winding, release the small advance wheel, and the film will wind properly.  I found that the frame spacing is very generous, and varies from 4-6 mm vs. about 2 mm for typical 35 mm cameras.  The frame counter on the top is manually set. Since there is no rangefinder in the viewfinder, I just estimated the distance and set the focus on the lens.  I could have brought a rangefinder, but I didn't.  I used sunny-16 for my exposure guide.  To shoot, you must pull out the lens away from the body, and the two very obvious metal knobs on each side of the front assembly are grasped for this.  Pull it out until it stops and rotate just a bit clock-wise.  Cock the shutter by moving the cocking lever (upper arm) until it catches.  The shutter release is the lower arm on the edge of the front assembly.  There is also a cable-release port.    It really wasn't that hard to operate, and is certainly much better than using an Argus A camera.    The full range of shutter speeds makes the camera far more usable with modern films.    I loaded the camera with a roll of Ilford Pan-F, rated at ISO 50.   To rewind the film, turn the small rotating wheel in the direction indicated  (R, clockwise) and turn the rewind knob.  There is no double-exposure prevention, so yes, the camera could be used for multiple exposures.negative sheet - note the wide frame spacingI  developed the Pan-F, and I am actually quite pleased with the results.  Despite being a bit awkward to use, the camera's shutter was accurate, and my focus was never off.  I shot it at the Biltmore Estate, and I think this 70-year old camera performed as good as new.   Perhaps there really is something to be said for simplicity.  No doubt that this camera is compact, and while it isn't going to win the award for elegance, it handles pretty well.  To me, the biggest deal-breaker is the bottom loading and the cumbersome film advance sequence.    However, the camera obviously beats the US-made Argus A series which use a similar lens arrangement and focus scheme.   It's remarkably smaller and lighter  than the Kodak Retina-1, which is of similar vintage.  The lens and shutter assembly of my Edinex and a Retina -1 are very similar. The Retina-1 likewise lacks a rangefinder, but does also have an accessory shoe for one.  Note that the Retina-1 was built by Nagel Kamerwek, so is also a German camera. I think if you really want a rabbit hole to chase down, take a look at Wirgin Edixa SLR models.  So many different models, so many Wirgins!!RESULTING IMAGES"},
{"title": "One Roll Review - Tasma Mikrat 200 - The Slow Meow", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2020", "text": "Back in February, I purchased three rolls of Tasma Mikrat 200 - an expired document copy film, from Eric (aka conspiracy.of.cartographers).  The film, cleverly named  by Eric as \"The Slow Meow,\" is  nominally a 6-12 ISO film, on acetate stock, and without an anti-halation layer.   How do I know it does not have an anti-halation later?  Read on, dear reader!First of all, by now you know that I love playing with slow films, and the Tasma Mikrat 200 is one that I had not had an opportunity to test out before now.  With any of the films from Tasma, it is likely that they are old stock, but given what I know about Russian and Ukraine film companies, it's safe to say that we don't ever really know what the actual story is.  I have tried many Svema films, as well as Tasma Mikrat Ortho and Tasma NKII film (sold by the FPP). However, The Tasma Mikrat 200 is one that stands out because I have seen very few examples of results from this film online.   When I saw that Eric was selling this film in 3-roll packs, I immediately placed an order.  It arrived very quickly, and the film cassetes were packed inside a black plastic ziploc bag.  I transferred them to black canisters, and made sure that I didn't leave them out in the light for too long.  Since I now know that the film is on an acetate base and not a polyester base, light-piping was not a problem.I loaded the first roll into a Nikon FM2N, since the lowest ISO setting is 12.  I used it with a series E 35mm f/2.5 lens (just for the hell of it, I suppose).  I shot the first few frames on an overcast day, and used a tripod.  The photos of the sheep at the Biltmore Estate were about 1/8 sec exposures (March 4).  The rest of the roll I shot on a sunny afternoon of March 8  along Depot Street in the River Arts District of Asheville.  Those were all hand-held, and I shot at 1/30 sec, meaning most were shot at f/8.  There were 34 exposures on that roll.  Today, I developed the roll in Rodinal at 1:50 for 12 minutes, per samples that Eric had posted online.After drying, the film has a very slight cupping, but nothing like Kodak Tri-X or old Agfa APX 400.  It scanned very well, and my initial reaction is that in a full sun situation, I could have shot the film at ISO 25.  For cloudy overcast conditions, I'd say that 12 was right on.    Due to the sunny conditions on the 8th, the film exhibited a \"blooming effect\" when bright reflections are in the frame, which I have seen with Lucky films, and with Polypan-F.   That indicates there the film has no anti-halation layer.  It would be far worse if the camera has a chrome or textured chrome film pressure plate.Overall, I am very pleased with this film and developer combination.  A bit contrasty in full sun, which is fine, but also very fine-grained.  Kudos to Eric for taking the risk of buying a big-ass roll of this film to share with the film-shooting community.  I'm glad that I purchased three rolls!RESULTSAt Biltmore Estate, overcast daylate in the day, setting sun.

{"title": "Cameras I Have Known", "date": "Friday, March 06, 2020", "text": "I was going through some of my older photos last night, and realized that I had enough material for a new post. The title, \"Cameras I have known\" is a lot better than \"cameras I have owned\" because some cameras have only been in my hands for a short while as they were parts of estates that I was selling.  Those estate sale cameras were interesting, varied, and it was a lot of fun to have met their acquaintance. Parting with some cameras brings backs memories of how I acquired them, and in some cases, the stories about how they came my way are more interesting than the camera.RARITIESThe Argoflex IIBack in the early 2000s, I visited a camera collector that was selling off a lot of cameras that he was no longer interested in.  I think I bought about a half-dozen cameras, and paid somewhere around $70.  It was early in my infatuation with Argus cameras, and one of the cameras I bought was an Argoflex TLR.  At the time, I did not realize what a rare thing I had purchased.  Upon some research and incredulous moments, I found that that I had one of a handful of examples of the Argoflex II twin-lens reflex.  In addition, it was different from other known Argoflex II models. First of all, you may wonder what was so darn special about the Argoflex II?My Argoflex IIThe only known examples of the Argoflex IIThe Argoflex II was supposed to be introduced in 1947, and it was meant to be an upgraded version of the Argoflex, with a metal body, and most notably, an automatic film wind that stopped at the proper space for each frame, just like a Rolleiflex would, even though the red window remained on the back of the camera.  According to Henry J. Gambino, author of \"Argomania,\" only about 300 cameras were produced, and the film wind did not work properly, so they were recalled and destroyed. It turns out that a handful survived, and of that handful, the one I owned had a different script logo on the front - perhaps it was the protoype.  The camera was designed by Harley Earl, and it's certainly possible that the camera came from someplace in Detroit, perhaps Earl's studio?  In any case, I had a unique model, which I soon had people offereing to purchase it from me.  In 2011, I was trying to get enough cash for a down-payment on a house for my daughter, and serendipitously received an offer to purchase the Argoflex II for a sum that was over $1000.  The timing was perfect, and I carefully packed that unique camera and it was on its way to a new home.  I don't regret selling it, as I had it for as long as I really wanted, and who know if the value would have gone down later on?The Black Argus C-4My Argus C-4This is another rare Argus camera, which has only a handful of known examples.  The body has a black anodized finish instead of the typical chrome. Chrome Argus C-4s are relatively plentiful, and of the few known black examples, it was rumored that they may have been made to attract a military contract (they were made from 1951-57, so maybe for the Korean War?), or perhaps they made some all-black models to make the camera look more appealing and stand out. For whatever reason, only a few were made, and of course, they are extremely collectible.  How I got mine was just dumb luck of the most amazing sort.  A woman had dropped off a box of cameras for the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, and Mike Myers, the club president brought the box to our meeting.  It was a matter of anytone reaching in and taking a camera.  I reached in and saw a black camera, and took it, and then... could not believe that what I was holding was one of the most sought-after American-made cameras.  A black Argus C-4.  I was dumbstruck.  While the camera could have used a CLA to make it operable, it was too rare to take out and about, anyways.  Again, in 2011 I sold it to the same collector that bought the Argoflex II, and received a very nice price for it.  How odd it was for me to have such amazing Argus luck -- twice!Now, the rest of the cameras that follow, are not necessarily rare, but they remain wonderful cameras, and some fall into \"why did I sell it?\" category. Others are ones that I had a brief fling with before they went on the market - also called testing before selling, as they were part of camera estates that I have sold over the past 15 years.The Kodak Medalist IIMy Kodak Medalist II came from the George O'Neal estate.  His family asked me to sell off his extensive camera collection after his death, and among the cameras that George owned was this Medalist II with all of the extra backs and accessories. George did collect a lot of Kodaks, and some Argus cameras.  Among his rarities was one of the earliest roll-film Kodak box cameras, the No. 2 Kodak Camera from the late 1890s, as well as a Number 1 Panoram Kodak camera (1900-1901).My Kodak Medalist IIThe Medalist II was produced post-WWII, and what is immediately obvious is the large helicoid tube on the front for focusing.  The camera is a rangefinder, and takes 620 film (more about that later).  The lens is a 5-element 100mm f/3.5 Ektar lens with a Kodak Supermatic shutter.  Parallax-correction and double-exposure prevention were additional features.  While there was only the one lens, one could use the camera for close-up work with the close-up extension backs that were sold separately. That was definitely an odd way to accomplish close-ups, but they allowed one to use 2.25 x 3.25\" sheet film, so I suspect that it was mostly for studio work.Matthaei Botanical gardens, Medalist IIUsing the Medalist II meant that I had to re-roll 120 onto 620 spools because the metal body was precisely machined for Kodak's 620 film spools.  Since I wear glasses, the tiny rangefinder focus window was really a pain to use, though the helical was easy to focus.  The camera is a wonderful piece of machinery, though as I realized, we were never meant to last in our relationship.  The large negative size was great, but the camera's ergonomics and peculiarities just meant that I rarely used it.  I briefly considered sending it off to get the camera modified to take 120 spools, but the money was better spent on a camera that replaced it... a Hasselblad 500c.  So, I sold the Medalist and its accessories.  It falls in the \"sorta regretted\" column, because it is a such a notable camera from Kodak.Rolleiflex AutomatMy Rolleiflex Automat 3.5In 2002, I was at a camera swap in SE Michigan, and saw one vendor hauling in boxes of cameras. He had not priced anything yet, and I saw this Rolleiflex among the many cameras he had just loaded onto the table.  I picked up the camera, which looked a bit beat-up on the outside. On close inspection, the glass was clear, the shutter speeds worked, and the interior was very clean. He said it hadn't been tested yet, but I could have it for $75.  SOLD!  I loved that camera, and I still don't know WHY I sold it in 2014.  At the time, I had just acquired a Mamiya C330 and lenses, I already had a Yashica A TLR, and a Hasselblad.  I probably should have sold the Yashica A (which I still use!).  If you have ever used a Rolleiflex, you know how smooth they are to operate.  I took quite a few rolls of film through that camera, and I now have a YashicaMat 124 that works pretty similarly to the Rollei Automat, except that it has a meter, which I find to be useful.  So, the moral of the story is...keep the Rolleiflex.The Hasselblad 500cMy Hasselblad 500c and the basic kitI suppose this is the camera that many, many photographers think of when you say \"medium format.\"  I really did enjoy shooting with the 500c, and I had several lenses for it, including the 50mm Distagon. I purchased it all when film camera prices were at the nadir because of the DSLR onslaught. People were trading them into camera dealers to buy the latest DSLRs that were popular in the mid-2000s.  Now, of course, those prices have risen a great deal due to more interest in shooting film.  My biggest problem with the Hasselblad was that it was a pain in the ass to use in cold weather.  Every control is around the lens, meaning gloves made it harder to use, etc.   Now that I live in NC, I wish I still had it at times.  I sold it all after I bought the Mamiya C330, and figured that I had too many square-format cameras.  The Mamiya C330 TLR certainly is a different camera than the 'blad, but the lenses sure are cheaper, too.  The loaned Bronica SQ-B that I used a few years ago, was possibly the perfect 'blad replacement. Alas, I have not yet purchased a Bronica.The Contax G1My mentor, Bill Brudon, gifted me a used Contax G1 with the 45mm lens in 2002. The only thing wrong with the camera was a slight bleed in the LCD panel on the top.  At the time, I was really not a rangefinder fan, as I was more into SLRs and doing close-up and macro-photography.  On top of that, the Contax G1 was a pretty posh camera, and extra lenses were beyond my means.  I took some pretty nice photos with it, and the only flaw, really, was the slow AF of the camera.  I know that I sold it sometime in the late 2000s.  I now realize that it was a foolish thing to sell it, but oh, well.Hasselblad SWCA handful of beautyUnderstandably, you may wonder why I didn't keep this absolute gem of a camera.  Alas, it was part of a large camera estate that I sold in 2014.  I shot it enough to test it and make sure everything worked as it should.  I know that it sold for a pretty hefty price, like it should have.  It's one of those cameras that you have to hold in your hand to appreciate the beauty and the genius of the camera.  The 35mm Zeiss Biogon has a 90°angle of view, and because the lens is so close to the film plane, there is no mirror box on the camera.  Very simple to operate with superb results.  However, it's a niche camera, but if that's your niche, this is the camera.Plaubel Makina 67 and 67WI used both of these cameras to test them out for an estate that I was selling in 2014.  Made in Japan, these rangefinder cameras have Nikkor lenses, and are the most compact and lightest 6x7cm cameras that I know of.  The lenses are on a short bellows and sliding tongs lock the lens into place. The 67 has an 80mm lens, and the 67W has a 55mm Nikkor lens.  While not a common camera, they seemed to be well-built, and certainly easier to travel with than a Pentax 6x7 or a Mamiya RB 67.  Had I not set my eyes on a Leica M2 in the estate, the Plaubel Makina 67W might have been my next choice.  I am pretty sure, though, that the M2 is getting more use by me than one of these interesting 6x7 camera would be getting.Great Wall DF-2simply cheesyGreat results, though!This Chinese-made camera, based upon the KW Pilot 6 medium-format SLR, is not even in the same class as any of the cameras listed above. However, its quirky design and less than stellar optics certainly make the camera memorable.  I also found that I made some remarkably beautiful images with it. I had it for just a few years, and stupidly sold it in 2013.  I have no idea why I did that. I'd buy another if the price was right, I suppose.Zeiss Magnar KameraOf all the cameras that I have sold over the years for various estates, this ranks right up there with the very rare and very odd.  Made by Zeiss, it's called the Magnar Kamera, and has an 800mm lens on a sliding brass tube.  Very few were made.  The front lens bezel is 105mm across.  Max aperture is f/10. Focal plane shutter.  I am trying to imagine shooting with this beast, and I just can't.  It was certainly fun playing with it, and I doubt many people have ever seen one in person. It was made in 1906, and like so many European cameras, it took a 9x12 cm plate.Envoy Wide AngleMason, MI, Envoy Wide AngleAnother estate sale camera, I am not sure why I didn't keep this one from getting away.  It's basically an English 6x9 box camera with a flip-up sports finder, designed for wide-angle photographs. It came with Taylor-Hobson 64mm f/6.5 fixed-focus lens with rim-set shutter from B, T, 1/25-1/125s. I was testing it out, and the images were great.  Wide-angle, and so easy to use, I don't understand why I didn't snap it up!I know that I have many more examples I could post here, but I think the above cameras are enough for now.  After handling many hundreds of cameras over the past 20 years, I think I have seen so many different cameras that there are not many I have yet to want to try out. There are certainly some \"dogs\" that I can tell you to avoid, but that's for a future post.  As far as cameras that I'd like to try out, the only ones that immediately come to mind are the Horizon, Widelux, Mamiya 7, and Fujifilm GL690 and GW690.Johan, taking up the photo shoot space!Well, what cameras do you regret selling?  What camera have you always wanted, but haven't been able to find or afford?  What cameras do you regret purchasing?  Do you have a \"holy grail\" camera?Don't end up like this guy.... sell the stuff you are not using while you are alive!"},

{"title": "Those were the days...", "date": "Saturday, February 22, 2020", "text": "I recently started scanning in some of my 35mm slides from 1980.  That was my first trip to the Southwestern US.  At the time, I was a graduate student at SUNY-ESF in Syracuse, NY, and was working on a master's degree in entomology.  Roy Norton, a professor in the department asked if I wanted to go on a two-week trip to the Sonoran Desert,  camping out along the way, and collecting insects at many locations (none from the national parks, of course).  It was a great trip in Roy's Ford Pinto station wagon, the back crammed with gear and supplies.  It's the trip where I learned to drive a manual-shift car, and my introduction to a real road trip across the USA.  We hit a lot of traditional destinations - Mesa Verde, Grand Canyon, Great Sand Dunes National Monument, Monument Valley, the Painted Desert, Flagstaff, Tuscon, Organ Pipe Cactus National Park, and Saguaro National Park. Mostly we took secondary roads once we got into Colorado, and I wish that I had kept a journal of that trip.  I did take a borrowed Pentax Spotmatic camera, which was certainly an upgarade over my old Exa Ia SLR.    There were no electronics, we navigated with road maps, and we always carried plenty of water. 1980 is the year that I think everything started to change.  I wish that I had been thinking as a photographer at the time and shot some of the town that we went through. The funky old towns hadn't yet been ravaged by Walmarts, and the uniformity we see today of chain stores and restaurants along strips had yet to happen.  Sure, we stopped at McDonald's when we were traveling, but we ate on a budget, and I have a memory of stopping somewhere in Arkansas for bread to make sandwiches (PB&J, of course), and all the store had was that awful white Wonder bread.  At the Grand Canyon, we camped at one of the campsites- and I found that the 25-cent shower was certainly a quick one.  That low-alcohol Coors sure tasted pretty good, too.The trip was a great success, and I have a fair number of slides from it.  I scanned a few slides earlier this week, and all of the scans require minutes of removing dust spots.  I shot Ektachrome and Kodachrome, and all of the slides have aged pretty well. Over 40 years, they have been moved around, and at some point in the mid-1980s, I transferred them from the slide boxes to plastic storage sheets in binders.  Now that I have more time, I'll continue to scan the slides in, and I am finding that I did pretty well with most of my shots.  It just takes some time to clean up the images after the scan.Here are a few... some have not been cleaned up.Great Sand Dunes National MonumentGreat Sand Dunes National MonumentGreat Sand Dunes National MonumentGreat Sand Dunes National Monumentnear Oak Creek Canyon, AZThe Grand Canyon, of courseArizona Snow Bowl near FlagstaffMonument Valley, converted from color slide."},
{"title": "One Roll Review - Rollei RPX 25", "date": "Saturday, February 15, 2020", "text": "It seems that this is one of the few low-ISO films that I have not tried until now.  The film came on the market in 2014, so it's been available for quite a while. I placed a big order of Rollei and other films that I had yet to try, and B&H quickly shipped them to my door.  Among the films was Rollei RPX 25, which I assumed was a sort of replacement for the old Agfa APX 25, which I definitely liked when I shot with it over a decade ago.  After doing a bit of research, the RPX 25 is a different sort of film, which is made by someone, certainly not Rollei. While the packaging and the Rollei name are licensed by Maco, the film is quite different from the Rollei Ortho 25 Plus, and is not advertised as having extended red sensitivity like the Retro 80s film. From the RPX 25 Datasheet (translated by user ashfaque on Rangefinder forum 12/2015):\"Low-sensitivity, high-resolution, panchromatic black and white film, ISO 25/15°Rollei RPX 25 is a panchromatic B&W film with a nominal sensitivity of ISO 25/15°, which is cast on a modern crystal clear, synthetic carrier.    This film is characterized by its high resolution at fine grain and high edge sharpness. Rollei RPX 25 behaves perfectly in over- or under-exposure due to its optimum sensitivity reserve of up to 2 stops. Depending on the developer, the film compensates critical lightning situations. The 5µ film - silver-rich-panchromatic sensitized Rollei RPX 25 is poured into a crystal-clear polyester carrier of 100µ. \"Main Features in BriefLow sensitive panchromatic film at ISO 25/15°Resolution Contrast Ratio 1000: 1 = 260 lines / mmRMS granularity (x1000) = 8Exposure range (between 12 and 50 ISO)Good pull-push characteristicsGood rendering of tonesVery good maximum blackness;Transparent = optimal for scanning and as slideOptimum flatness thanks to anti-curling layerI shot my roll of RPX 25 while on a trip to Dutchess Co., NY in early February.  I also traveled around the nearby CT/MA/NY area, and when I found myself at Great Falls on the Housatonic River, I knew that a low-ISO film was perfect for what I was seeing.  I loaded my Nikon FM3a with the RPX 25 and had exposures of about 2 sec maximum.  I saw no problem with long vs normal exposure times.  I developed the film in Kodak D-76 1:1 for 8 minutes at 20°C.some negatives on the light tableIn my research about this film, I found that it could have been made by Agfa, and might have been the Agfa Aviphot 80 aerial film. Which apparently, is the same as the Rollei Retro 80s.  I have shot the Retro 80s, and I like it, and it does not appear to me to be the same film.  The Polyester base does lie very flat, which to me, is a plus in scanning.   I know that the Rollei films are all rebranded from other manufacturers, and of course, it's not old-stock Agfa APX 25. What exactly is it?  Does it really matter?  It's documented that the Rollei Retro 80s is the Aviphot 80 film.   I am not buying that RPX 25 is the same film.  I am glad that the RPX 25 is available and from what I have seen thus far, an excellent film for landscapes.  I'll leave the keyboard commandos to their theories about the film's origin.One may argue that one roll isn't really testing this film.  I shot the film at the box speed, using a camera and a subject that I am familiar with in my shooting style.  Yes, I used a tripod and a cable release.  I feel that my results matched my expectations for a low-ISO panchromatic film.  Of course, I would shoot this film again.   One bit of caution - since the film is on a PET base, light-piping can occur, so keep the film in the black canister, and load in dim light. All images shot with a Nikon 35-105 zoom Nikkor, unless otherwise specified.on the way home, along I-26 N of Asheville, 50mm f/1.4 nikkoron the way home, along I-26 N of Asheville, 50mm f/1.4 nikkor"},

Besides the 50mm 1.4, I have the 28mm/3.5, 35mm /3.5, and 135mm/2.5, which is a wonderful lens.  All are in excellent condition, and make for a nice kit.  In addition, I have other M-42 lenses, such as the Helios 44 from a Zenit 12XP.If you are interested in trying any of the old M-42 SLRs, you can't wrong with the Spotmatic F.  While there are a plethora of M-42 SLR bodies out there by Ricoh, Chinon, Praktica, Mamiya, Zenit, etc., none of them have the finish and feel of a Spotmatic. Pentax Spotmatic Resouces:CameraAgxJim Grey's blogCasual PhotophileAdventures On FilmOnline Manual from ButkusHistory of PentaxA few recent images...Fomapan 400:Ilford Ortho Plus 80:"},
{"title": "The Samsung Evoca 90w Neo ", "date": "Thursday, January 23, 2020", "text": "EVOCA by SamsungTo be honest, I didn't realize that Samsung made 35mm cameras until this one showed up in a box full of point and shoots.  Samsung did, in fact produce some very good compact P&S 35mm cameras, as well as an APS P&S.  The camera's clean design, short zoom range, Schnieder lens, and LCD rear display intrigued me enough to try it out.  The Samsung Evoca lineFrom what I have found so far, Samsung sold 35mm point and shoots from at least 1990 into the early 2000s.  Shutterbug's June 1, 2002 archived page has an article by Peter K. Burian reporting on P&S cameras from the PMA show.    There were several model lines by Samsung -- Maxima, Pronta, and  Evoca. The Evoca line was apparently their top line for \"photo enthusiasts\":  \"Samsung's Evoca line now includes a model with a zoom lens that includes a true wide angle 28mm focal length. The Evoca 90W Neo QD is a fully automatic model with a 28-90mm f/4.5-11 Schneider-Kreuznach lens and diopter correction eyepiece. In spite of the moderate price ($210) this camera is said to be housed in a titanium body. Features include continuous autofocus, two Program modes, Panorama Frame mode, and a remote control unit, plus an advanced flash unit.\"It's quite possible that the Evoca cameras were the outcome of the purchase of Rollei by Samsung in 1995.  It's been suggested that the Prego cameras were the inspiration for the Evoca line, and I have to say that the lens choice may have been the result.  I have found the Prego cameras to be delicate things.  The Evoca 90 W Neo is not fragile. There are several Evoca models -70 SE, 35-70mm  Schneider-Kreuznach zoom (highly touted in 12/1999 Popular Photography as a travel camera)70 S, 35-70mm Samsung SHD lens ($129 in May 1999 Popular Photography)90w Neo, 28-90mm Schneider-Kreuznach Varioplan Zoom (Reviewed here) Zoom 115,  38-115mm, (also called Fino outside of USA)140 S QD,  38-140mm f/4.6-12.2 Schneider-Kreuznach zoom 170 Neo QD, 38-170mm Schneider-Kreuznach zoom, passive (not active) multi-point autofocus, Panorama Frame mode, and backlight compensation control The Samsung Evoca 90w Neo –At first glance, one might think this was an early digital P&S, especially since there is a small rear LCD panel which occupies the left side.   However, this 2002 camera appeared at a time when a digital P&S could not compare in image quality to 35mm.  It was however, the end of the premium compact 35mm cameras, as consumers started buying the premise that digital was the new “best thing.rear of camera zoom at 90mmThe 90 Neo is a bit unusual in that its zoom range is from 28-90mm.  There are not many short-range P&S zooms with such a good lens as the Schneider- Kreuznach Varioplan.  In use, I found myself shooting mostly at the wide end, as 28mm is a good focal length for a lot of street photography. Camera specificationsLens- 28-90mm Schneider-Kruzenenach Varioplan, f/4.5-11.  Focus – 2 ft – infinityShutter speeds – B, 1/3 – 1/400 secISO - (via DX coding) 50-3200Viewfinder – Real image, 80% coverage, adjustable diopterFocus – automatic, can be preset for infinityFilm Advance – Automatic, power rewindExposure Modes – Automatic, Bulb, ProgramFlash – Built-in, range 2 ft – 34 ft at ISO 400, 28mm, 8 sec recycle time, red-eye reductionTripod socket – yesRemote control – optionalSelf-timer – 10 secLED Info – focus, flash readyLCD Display - battery condition, date / time, film advance mode, flash mode, frame counter, program, red-eye reduction, remote control indicator, self-timer mode, zoom; Features - auto power off, autofocus lock, captions imprint, panorama mode Power – 1 CR123A 3V batteryWeight – 8.1 ouncesDimensions – 4.6 x 1.7 x 2.6 inchesOverall, a pretty good array of features that should appeal to the compact p&s crowd.  In fact, it compares very favorably with the Yashica T4 Zoom (made by Kyocera).   In hindsight, had Samsung just issued this with a 28mm f/3.5 single focal length, I think it would have been a highly desirable camera with the street shooting crowd, and would be commanding Contax T3 prices today.  Alas, the zooms were the thing in the late 1990s, but the Evoca 90w certainly is a very good camera if you can find one. I loaded the camera with a roll of Kodak T-max 100 film and took it with me to Columbia, SC.  It was easy to use, and of course, easy to goof up things without a manual.  In the course of using it, I somehow selected \"print\" with the multiple controls on the rear of the camera, and ended up having the date imprinted on most of the negatives (without having set the date and time, no less).  Subsequently, I loaded a roll of T-max P3200, and made sure that I had everything set properly. Conclusions -The Samsung Evoca 90w Neo is a great little camera.  The zoom is fast and quiet, and I liked being able to preset the camera for infinity focus and no flash.  To me, the 28mm focal length was my preferred setting.  I also liked the Panorama masking mode.  The images at 28mm had a definite panoramic look when the Panorama mode was selected via an easily-found switch on the back.  The adjustable diopter in the viewfinder was a nice feature, too.  The body of the camera feels comfortable in the hand, with nothing protruding when the camera is shut off.  It is easy to use, and apart from my mistake with the date stamp, the camera modes are easily adjusted via the mode dial on the back.  Note, I am not a fan of date-stamping an image. It has no place in serious photography, and it certainly does not indicate that one can verify when an image was made.  According to my images, I was there in 2015.This seems to be one of the less-seen models on eBay.  The 70SE 115, as well as the 170 are typically in the $5 to $60 range, but the 90 does not show up.  Given that it was sold at the end of the compact 35mm P&S era, probably not as many were sold as the earlier models.  I would say that if you were to find one, $50 would be a good price. IMAGESP3200, selfieP3200, All Souls Cathedral, Biltmore Village, NCP3200 living room lightP3200, Biltmore Village, NCP3200, Biltmore VillageColumbia, SC State House steps, Tmax 100Tmax 100, Panorama mode, Columbia SCTmax100, ca. 90mm, Columbia, SCTmax100, ca. 35mm, Columbia, SCTmax100, 28mm, panorama mode, Columbia, SCTmax 100, Columbia, SCTmax 100, Columbia, SC"},
{"title": "What Is it?", "date": "Wednesday, January 22, 2020", "text": "What is it?It is easy to take certain things for granted. Almost everything we use daily probably has a patent associated with it.  Someone had to invent something, and in doing so, wished to profit from the invention.  In the United States, the 1790 Patent Act was the first Federal patent law of the United States, although patents were granted within the colonies prior to the federal law.  If you have a patent number, it is easy to find the patent online.Any item that has been patented has a patent number and date associated with it.  So, what does this have to do with photography, and specifically, this item?  The item you see here is a small wood box with a sliding steel cover that was used to mail 2x2 photographic slides.  It was patented on June 25, 1957 by Edward Grosz, of Ann Arbor, Michigan.  I have not been able to find out much more than that his address was listed as 1704 Jackson Avenue, Ann Arbor.  However, the U.S. patent and the entry in the Patent Gazette were easily found via Google.I don't even know where I picked this item up. It may have been in a box of photography \"junk\" or maybe I found it at work, but I know that I have hung onto it for about 10 years for the sole reason that it was made by someone in Ann Arbor.Upon close examination, It's obvious that this is a hand-made item.  The box is constructed of hardwood plywood and held together with small brads.  It's been fine-sanded and lacquered and has held up for at least 60 years.  I looked up the address on Google Maps and see that Edward lived in a small bungalow on Jackson Avenue just past the little cluster of shops and gas station where Dexter road and Jackson Avenue diverge from Huron Street.  I passed by that place often, and who would have guessed that 50 years ago Mr. Grosz had a small business making and distributing these slide mailers?  \"Used the world over\" no less!Of course, Ann Arbor is no stranger to photographic industry, as Argus and later, Vokar cameras were manufactured in the city and surrounding area. Photo Systems Inc., is based in Dexter, MI, just a few miles down the road.  PSI manufactures the photographic chemicals that are used by many of us.While we rarely mail out photographic slides these days, it's interesting to note that there was a small cottage industry in Ann Arbor manufacturing slide mailers that were used the world over!"},
{"title": "Half-Frame Interlude - the Olympus PEN EE", "date": "Monday, January 13, 2020", "text": "I interrupt this typical stream of full-frame cameras with a short review of the Olympus PEN EE (Electric Eye) half-frame camera.  Olympus is well-known for its line of PEN 35mm half-frame cameras.  From the lovely PEN F SLR, to the various flavors of PEN rangefinder and zone-focus  bodies, the PEN cameras were well-built, dependable cameras with metal bodies and excellent Zuiko glass.  I think the original intent was to make these cameras as ubiquitous as a pen - carried everywhere, ready to use when needed.  The half-frame of 18 x 24mm on a roll of 35mm film allowed one to double the number of shots on a roll of film versus a full frame camera.  That kind of economy appealed to thrifty shooters, and those that used a PEN as a sort of documentary device.  Imagine going on a trip with just a few rolls of 36 exposure film -- a PEN would give you 72 images per roll. Now, imagine carrying this PEN EE with you. No batteries, no adjustments needed, just point and shoot.  With its 28mm f/3.5 lens, everything was in focus from 6 feet to infinity. Back in the day, you could shoot Kodachrome with this little camera and get your slides back, properly mounted in half-frame masks on regular 2x2 slides.The specifications for the PEN EEIntroduced 1961Lens 2.8 cm f/3.5 D.

In dim light, the shutter defaults to 1/40 sec, with the apertures ranging from f/3.5 to f/8, and in brighter conditions, 1/200 sec from f/4.5 to f/22. So, for a 200 ISO film, pretty much any normal situation.  I did test out a flash, which the camera sets the shutter speed at 1/40 sec.  The flash result seemed pretty satisfactory.Overall, the PEN EE is easy to use, as you might imagine.  Note that in half-frame cameras, the vertical (portrait) orientation is the default, and you must turn the camera 90° for horizontal (landscape) shots. Here are a series of scans from the Eastman 5222 film. It was developed in D-76, diluted 1:1 for 7.5 minutes.  I think that with half-frame, it is best to shoot as fine-grained a film as possible, and there are slower films such as T-max 100 that would be perfect for this camera.  The negatives were scanned on my Epson V700 scanner.indoors with window lightdrive-by shootingindoors with ambient lightwith external flash unitMarshall, NCMarshall, NCMarshall, NCFrench Broad River, Asheville, NCFrench Broad River, Asheville, NCFrench Broad River, Asheville, NCDoes the PEN EE live up to the idea that a camera could be as easy to use and ubiquitous as a pen?  It pretty much does. Before the age of smartphones and tiny digital p&s cameras, the PEN cameras would have been great to always have with you. Yes, the Rollei 35 was about the same size, but it is fiddly compared to the PEN EE. The PEN EE and EES (pretty much the same, but with adjustable focus and and an f/2.8 lens) would have been easily carried along, ready for a snap on a moment's notice. However, I think that you really have to have a mindset that half-frame is right for you.  For me, it's a curiosity to play with, and as I noted earlier, my Olympus Trip 35 is full-frame, and gives me results that I am happy with. I am not knocking the cameras -- they are wonderful gems.  I just am not the happy half-framer!  I think that if you want full-frame with a camera even smaller than the pen, the Olympus XA series is exactly fitting in with the idea of the PEN."},

I think a photo book about the route would be a great thing, since it passes through so many towns, and I don't know if I would do it alone, or get collaborators to photograph segments in their home states.  All on film, of course.  I'll have to give it more thought and planning and see what I come up with. cameras for me to work on...My plans for 2020 -- not quite sure as yet, but I know that I'll be doing more camera testing, film testing, and traveling.  All which should yield a lot more photographs.  I want to shoot more medium format, especially with my Mamiya C330, and use Ilford Ortho film with it.  I have a road trip to Arizona planned for April, and maybe one to New York in February.   I'll be starting out the year with a couple of days in Columbia, SC. So, as we finish out this year, I hope that film photography continues to be as popular as it has been the past few years.  I am not exaggerating when I say that film sales have been phenomenal.  I wish you all the best for 2020!Route 11, Harrisonburg, Va.

{"title": "Developing High-Contrast Films with POTA ", "date": "Monday, November 25, 2019", "text": "old TechPan, POTA, Nikkormat ELOctober 2019Over the course of the past 20 years, I have been trying to become a better photographer.  When I started on this journey, my mentor, William Brudon (1921-2009) was instrumental in extolling the virtues of various films that he used.  One of the films that he absolutely loved was Kodak's Technical Pan film.  Not only was Bill a photographer, but he was also a well-known natural history and medical illustrator as well as a painter of some wonderful landscapes.   For him, Technical Pan was one of those wonder films that could be used for high-contrast black and white reproduction, as well as superb pictorial work and copy work that required a great tonal scale.  As a result, I too, realized what a wonderful film TechPan was for landscapes photography.  TechPan's drawback was that it was (a) a very slow film of ISO 25, and (b) it required the special Kodak Technidol developer to achieve that wonderful tonal scale.  Its advantage is that the film is virtually grainless, making 35mm negatives capable of producing very large prints.  It was also available in 120 and 4x5 sheet film.   As my supply of TechPan and Technidol developer diminished, I figured that it was the end of working with that film.However, in the past 8 years, I acquired a supply of TechPan, both in 35mm and a small amount of 120.  I had ordered some TD-3 from Photographer's Formulary, and realized that it had a short shelf life, even if unopened.  Stand processing in 1/100 Rodinal just didn't do it for me, and I am not a fan of really thin negatives.   I had seen POTA listed as a developer to be used with high contrast films, but didn't know much about it.  POTA? What the hell is that?my home-rolled TechPanEarlier this year, I read up on POTA, and it seemed like a good candidate for developing TechPan as well as other high-contrast films.  I had to put that research away for a bit, as we moved from Ann Arbor, MI to just outside Asheville NC  in late July.    In the past 2 months, I have been developing several high-contrast films with POTA, and am realizing just how good a developer it is.First of all, what is POTA? According to The Film Developing Cookbook (Anchell & Troop, 1998, Focal Press, 165 pp. ISBN-13: 978-0-240-80277-0), POTA  was developed by Martin Levy and the formula published in 1967.  The acronym POTA stands for Photo-Optics Technical Area at the Ft. Monmouth military installation where Levy was employed.  A weird thing to name a developer after a place, but oh, well.  The purpose of POTA was to use high-resolution document films such as Kodak Technical Pan, Agfa Ortho, and Macophot ORT25 as normal photographic films.  The why is quite obvious.  When properly processed, these ultra fine-grained films can rival large format results using 35mm film.One thing to keep in mind is that these document films have a limited contrast range, and highlights may be blown out, so they tend to work better in low-contrast situations.  Some negatives with one film, Eastman 2378 bears this out. Developers such as Technidol and TD-3 can provide an increased contrast range (up to 12 stops, according to Anchell and Troop), but generally, document films will have impaired highlight rendition in typical daylight scenes.So, what to do?  Anchell and Troop recommend the following developers with document films: XTOL 1:5, POTA, Kodak Technidol-LC, and Photographer's Formulary TD-3.   Technidol is no longer manufactured, and TD-3 is also a special developer that has to be ordered. XTOL 1:5 produces thin negatives (at least in my experience).  POTA, however, consists of only 2 compounds, and is easy to make yourself.  Anchell & Troop state that \"POTA-type developers produce exceptionally even density growth over their useful range but have an abrupt shoulder after 8 zones. No further highlight detail is available above that point.\"  expired TechPan, POTA, Oct. 2019My original objective was to use POTA to test a bunch of bulk-loaded TechPan that I acquired  some time ago.  I had planned on hand-rolling it and selling the film after I tested it.  It turns out that someone had opened the bulk loader to see what was inside, and that was enough to fog the film through the overlapping sprocket holes, as well as the edges of the frame.  Plus, the film expiration date was 1990, so there is some small amount of base fog.  I can still use it, but no way that I could sell it like that.  Using POTA gave me the urge to test it with other document, high-contrast and ortho films to see how they would fare as traditional pictorial films. I seem to have an inexhaustible supply of Kodak's Kodalith, as well as some other oddball films that the Film Photography Project has made available.TechPan, shot in 2008, developed in POTA, 2019. Mamiya 645The formula for POTA does remind me of D-23 in the sense that it is a 2-compound developer.The components to make 1 liter of POTA:Sodium Sulfite Anhydrous - 30 gPhenidone 1.5gDissolve the dry chemicals in 750 ml water at 35°C, then add water to make 1 liter.  Not all of the Phenidone will dissolve, but don't worry about it.Use the POTA developer as soon as the temperature cools to 24°C.  The developer oxidizes quickly after mixing, and typically it's recommend that you use it within an hour.   I recommend that you read Anchell and Troop's book for more information on the chemistry of POTA, and how to modify the formula for longevity and less fogging.I have plenty of Phenidone and many pounds of Sodium Suflite, so POTA seems to me to be a good alternative to TD-3 and XTOL.  I weigh out the dry ingredients for each 1 liter batch and put them in a ziplock bag so that I can mix them when I need them.  If you have to order the chemicals, ArtCraft Chemicals Inc. has them, as well as many other raw photo chemicals.  50 g of Phenidone is $12, and 1 lb of Sodium Sulfite is $6.50.  That's enough to make 33 liters of developer, which would develop up to 132 rolls of film, for a cost per roll of less than 15 cents.  That's pretty damn cheap!  Of course, you can use POTA for normal contrast films, but your results may not be optimal.Anchell and Troop also provide another formula for a low-contrast developer called TDLC-103:Metol - 1gSodium sulfite - 5gSodium Bicarbonate (baking soda) - 10gdissolve to make 1 literThis doesn't have the problems with Phenidone that POTA has, and I am going to give it a try soon. Anchell and Troop stated that TDLC-103 is more likely to give good results with document films, and as an extreme low contrast developer for normal contrast films. I think development times are 10-15 minutes with minimal agitation - 10 seconds every 3 minutes to suppress highlight development.  I am assuming that the development temp is 20° C.My latest adventure with POTA was developing some long outdated Kodalith Otho Type 3 6556 film.  I shot the film in my Nikon F100, rated it at ISO 12, and developed in POTA for 11 minutes.  To say I was blown away with my results is an understatement.  I did not expect the rich tonal scale that I saw on the negatives.  I have never seen such good results with Kodalith before.   I am going to shoot some more later this with some different subject matter and see how it goes.Kodalith Ortho, Nikon F100, POTA, Nov. 2019POTA Development TIMES (all at 24°C)Kodak Technical Pan - 12 minutesEastman 5363 - 12 minutesKodak 2378 - 11 minutesKodalith Ortho Type 3  – 11 minutesEastman 5363, POTA, Nikon FA, October 2019.Kodak 2378, POTA, Canon AE-1P, October, 2019Kodalith Ortho, POTA, Nikon F100, November 2019Kodalith Ortho, POTA, Nikon F100, November 2019Kodalith Ortho, POTA, Nikon F100, November 2019"},

Three of them were Rollei-branded films, Ortho 25 Plus, RPX 25, Retro 80 S; Catlabs X Film 80, and Bergger Pancro 400.  I have previously reported on the Bergger film.  On top of that, I have an order of the Ilford Ortho Plus 80 coming to me.  All of these are b&w films, and I am totally amazed at the number of film stocks now on sale.  Even accounting for the re-branding of films by Kosmo, etc., it's obvious that we have more b&w film stocks available now than I can remember in the past 20 years.  The Darkroom has put up a handy guide to films that should be useful to the typical person shooting film.  The chart there shows 46 films, and those are all ones that The Darkroom can process.  It's obviously missing the Kodak Vision films (ECN-2 process), the odd emulsions that require special developers, and many of the b&w films that the Film Photography Project has brought to market.  So, when anyone asks \"Can you still buy film?\"  You can tell that person that there are over 50 different films available now.We don't have the plethora of  positive color films that existed 20 years ago, and that can easily be explained by the fact that pro shooters accounted for the majority of E-6 and Kodachrome sales that were quickly taken over by the digital onslaught.  For the publishing industry, digital was a real boon, as the workflow no longer involved the darkroom as being the intermediate step.  For the art photographer, it was a more personal choice.  However, the mere fact that Kodak released Ektachrome once again last year is a good sign that a major gap was being filled. As far as C-41 films, there are enough choices out there to make most people happy.  While I shoot color film, it still represents a minority of my film usage.  I do use digital for a majority of my color work -- and my Nikon Df is one hell of a camera.   My first choice is b&w film, for a lot of reasons.  I like the moods that I can get with different films, I like being able to experiment with using low-ISO films and odd emulsions, and I like the way b&w film shows the world that I photograph.  In addition, film grain - the lack of, as well as the presence of, can really add another dimension to an image.  I think back to some early shots that I did with Kodak's high speed recording film - it had grain like nothing else, and I wish that I had used it in the right situations to make that grainy stuff work as an asset to the image.  On the other end of the grain scale, Ilford Pan-F and Kodak Tmax 100 are really excellent films.   To me, the allure of so many different films is that a film stock becomes part of my creative process. One other thing to note, is that I am working on a zine devoted to monochrome shooting.  I'll say more about it as I get closer to a final product, but I hope to have it ready by January 2020.  The first issue will focus on low-ISO films. As these November days move into December days, I am very happy that I moved to western North Carolina.  We have far more sunny days than cloudy ones this time of year, and those low sun angles represent more opportunities for shooting b&w film!"},
{"title": "The Ricoh XR-M SLR", "date": "Sunday, November 03, 2019", "text": "By the mid-1980s, camera manufacturers were moving towards more plastic in the bodies of 35mm SLR cameras. Point and shoots had already achieved this, as the ABS plastic was found to be excellent for camera bodies.  The consumer-level SLRs such as the Canon T50 and T70, Nikon N2000, and Pentax P30 featured plastic bodies with internal metal chassis, or in some cases, more ABS plastic.  Ricoh introduced its XR-M SLR in 1987, and this manual-focus auto-wind camera features design elements that remind me of both the Canon T70 and a  Minolta Maxxum 7000.The Ricoh XR-M has a bunch of features that place this camera as being quite advanced and I am surprised that it didn't get more attention.Fairly good control layout!  Looks much like a 1990s SLRThere is an optical frame counter - no IR for you.clean designFeatures and SpecificationsTop-deck LCD display panelProgram modes - P, A, M, SISO setting via DX or manually entered from 12-6400Auto film loading, film auto-advance and rewindfilm loaded windowViewfinder with the following functions visible:AE lock indicatorSubtractive film counterExposure CompensationOver/under exposure indicatorShutter speedProgram mode (PASM)Shutter speedFlash readyApertureAuto backlight indicatorSpot metering indicatorAveraged metering indicatorFill Flash indicator Obviously presaging cameras such as a Nikon N50, based upon the above specs!Viewfinder - 91% coverage, the XR-M has an angled split image focus spot and microprism focus collar, as well as a matte screen to aid in focus.  In use, I found the split image focus spot to be very easy to see and use.Depth of Field Preview button!Self-timer with variable time settingsProgrammed flash photography with Ricoh SpeedlightsTV mode - for photographing TV screen, set at 1/30 sec.Center-weighted metering and spot metering modesInterval timer- set to fire shutter 1 sec to 1 hour for time-lapseSingle frame shooting to continuous, as well as multiple exposuresAE lock!Exposure Compensation +/- 4 stops in 1/3 stop incrementsBulb settingLeft hand-shutter release can be programmedPower- Requires 4 AA cellsShutter - vertical focal plane shutter 30 sec - 1/2000 sec, plus B- 1 sec to 1 hourLens mount - Ricoh system R-K mount.  You can use other K-mount lenses with this camera, but I do not think all will work in Program mode.Tripod socketWeight with 50mm lens and 4 AA cells is 1 lb 11 oz.Have yet to test out the flash and the zoom lens.Available accessories:Super Data Back 4Data back 3Interchangeable viewfinder screensSpeedlight PXXR Speedlight 300P, as well as other speedlightsOverall, a staggering amount of options and control for a 1987 off-brand SLR.This camera came to me with the control button cover missing. That's just a small piece of plastic that covers the 4 orange control button on the left top of the camera.  You really do need the the manual to get the most out of this camera. However, once you figure out the system, it's pretty easy to use in most of its operation.I found that the right-hand grip (which contains the 4 AA cells, much like a Minolta Maxxum 7000) makes the camera very easy to hold, with my index finger falling directly over the shutter button.  There is no screw-in cable release, but a small remote socket on the rear of the body, which looks a lot like that of a Canon rebel's simple remote socket.The interval timer is pretty cool. I set it to shoot a frame every two seconds and had fun standing in front of the camera and letting it fire away. It went through a 24 exposure roll of Kentmere 400 in less than a minute.I took the camera out to the River Arts District of Asheville on a nice day in late October and shot a couple of rolls of film.  The auto-advance of the film combined with shooting it in P mode, made it act like a P&S SLR - much like a Canon AE-1P, but with auto-wind. I really like the way in feels in the hand, and it was easy to shoot with.I'm not sure why this camera hasn't gotten more love.  Maybe it was just a bit ahead of its time, and maybe if it had autofocus, it might have been a bigger deal. In any event, I found it very easy to shoot with, though perhaps at the time it came out, not having dials and traditional SLR-style controls was considered to be too gimmicky.  The controls certainly would have been right there with 1990s cameras, though.I say that the camera reminds me a lot of the Canon T-70, and it really does have a similar look and feel to that camera, right down to the gray plastic body.  However, the Ricoh XR-M has far more modes and control options than the Canon T-70. Perhaps if the camera had a Pentax logo on it, it may have fared better.  It certainly seems better made than a lot of the Pentax plastic-bodied SLRs from that era.This camera came with the 35-70 zoom as well as the 50mm f/2 Rikenon lens (which I used), as well as the Ricoh XR 300P speedlight (which I did not use).  The overall package is one that would be quite usable by any photographer.Now some sample photos, of course! These are all on Tmax 100."},
{"title": "Trippin' with that Lomochrome Purple!", "date": "Wednesday, October 30, 2019", "text": "Last year, I reported on using my one and only roll of Lomochrome Purple XR 100-400.  In the fall, I immediately placed an order for 5 rolls when Lomo announced they were accepting pre-orders for a new batch.  The film arrived back in May, I think, but due to the whole moving thing, my rolls were tucked away until things were settled here in North Carolina.  In August, I finally shot the first of my Lomochrome Purple in my Olympus Trip 35.  I sent the roll to The Darkroom earlier this month, and they processed the film.    I scanned the negatives in my Epson V700 scanner, and of course, I am really liking the results.  I shot the film at ISO 200, and the Trip 35 is the perfect camera for these wacky films.  I am not tying up an SLR with an unusual film, and as the Trip 35 takes up so little space in my bag, I can carry it with me on multiple photo shoots and it's there when I see something that I think would look good in that alternate reality world of Lomochrome Purple.Here are a few images from the roll.  Most of them are on my Flickr page, as well.  I think the 200 ISO rating gives some nice results, and it's like a faux color infra-red film.  I know that I'll get the best results in full sun, so I try to go with that when I can.  I really enjoy using the Olympus Trip 35, and it remains one of my favorite little cameras.Sierra Nevada Brewery, Mills River, NCThese flowers are really yellow and orange. Bridge over reed Creek, UNC Botanical GardenUNC Botanical GardenUNC Botanical GardenKudzu, of course.

{"title": "Ilford's New Ortho Plus!", "date": "Friday, October 25, 2019", "text": "image from Ilford PhotoIlford Photo has been teasing us for the past week or so, with references to something new.  Alas, they revealed their new products  on 10/24 at the Photo Plus Expo in New York City.  Reports are that analog photography has a much bigger presence at Photo Plus this year, which is a great sign.  Ilford has introduced two new products -- their Multigrade V RC paper, and a new film in 35mm and 120 format.  Ilford Ortho Plus is an Orthochromatic film with a daylight ISO of 80.  What's an Orthochromatic film, you ask?  Ortho films are insensitive to red, and that means you can develop them by inspection UNDER A DARK RED SAFELIGHT.  Amber  (OC)  safelights will fog the film. Ortho films are great for landscapes and architecture, as they tend to have finer grain than panchromatic films, and are contrastier, with red/oranges  being dark.   The Ilford Ortho Plus is a good sign that Ilford is listening to the photo community, as it is a bit of a niche film.  The faster speed is nice.  The problem with other ortho films is that they are usually very slow, and too contrasty without a special developer.   While Kodak's Kodalith (of course, no longer made) is an ortho film, it's not a good pictorial film, as it's made to do high-contrast (i.e., pure black and white) images.  There are examples out there of other ortho films, most of which I have tried, and all are special-purpose emulsions that don't usually work well for pictorial use.  So, I am excited about the Ilford Ortho Plus.   I know the Ortho Plus film has been available as sheet film for some time, so it's good that us roll-film users get a chance to also shoot with it.The Ilford Ortho Plus spec sheet gives developer information as well as how to adjust for reciprocity for exposures longer than 1 second.  That's important, because this film would be great for photographing waterfalls. Also, note that if you use it under tungsten lighting, the ISO rating is 40.Anyhow, I look forward to testing a roll or two and see how it performs."},
{"title": "The Ricoh  FF3-AF Point & Shoot", "date": "Wednesday, October 23, 2019", "text": "Back in the early 1980s, we were being treated to a  plethora of small, plastic-bodied 35mm point and shoot cameras.  Few attained the cult-like status of the Olympus XA (1979), which I think set the bar for design, ease of use, and image quality. Of course, the XA isn't a true point and shoot, but the XA2 that followed it is. Incorporating a flash always made for a larger camera, and because of that, the XA series with the separate flash module always were smaller than the cameras that incorporated a flash in the body.  Ricoh, while not a household name at the time, produced some interesting cameras, and probably made cameras for other brands.  The Ricoh FF-3 AF was introduced in 1983, and while it does not exactly stand out in the crowd, it doesn't try to do too much, and that is a good thing.The Ricoh FF3-AF is an autofocus camera with a 5 element 35mm f/3.2 lens.  The lens cover slides back and forth across the front of the camera.  Uncovered, the camera is ready to go.  You set the ASA (ISO) by rotating a dial to the L of the lens, and film speeds range from 25 to 1000.  This was 1983, remember?  The film advance and rewind are motorized.  The self-timer is 10 seconds, and I think the close-focus distance is about 1 meter,  There is a window on the film door, so I don't recommend the camera for IR film.  A green light shows up on the L side of the top deck to indicate that the film is winding properly.  Just below it, a light indicates the self-timer is operating. You manually select the flash (a good idea) by pushing a tab to the L on the front of the camera. Best of all, the camera needs only 2 AA batteries to operate.  There is a tripod socket on the bottom.  No fiddly controls, and everything makes this autofocus point and shoot a bargain buy if you find one.  I especially like the fixed focal length of 35mm, making it a good candidate as a street camera.  As I said, there are no truly outstanding features, but the sum total is a compact, easy to use camera with a very good lens.I did something I rarely do with a new camera -- I loaded a long-expired roll of b&w film. I used a roll of 1988 dated Agfapan 400.  Because of its age, I set the ISO at 100 on the front of the camera. There is no DX sensor inside to set film speed, which I really appreciate.Loaded up with film, the camera weighs 12.8 ounces.  It fits into a pocket on my photo vest (which is a vest from Duluth Trading).  I took it around with me on several outings, and shot the roll of old Agfapan 400.  While there was some base fog, the scans came out pretty well.  In fact, I am quite pleased with the results from this old film!My conclusion -- it's an underrated point and shoot camera that isn't particularly common.  I think if you find one for less than $10, pick it up.  It fits into a coat pocket quite easily, and the images from it will be just fine.Now, some of the images..."},
{"title": "OVER ONE MILLION VIEWS!  ", "date": "Wednesday, October 16, 2019", "text": "Whew!  I checked my stats this morning and saw this:When I started Random Camera Blog back in 2004, blogging had become popular, and little did I anticipate that I would still be writing about cameras and photography in the same venue 15 years later.  I started Random Camera Blog in mid-October 2004, as well as joined Flickr at the same time.  With almost 700 blog posts and over 13,000 images on Flickr since then, I guess I can say that I have some staying power.   For me, photography is a huge part of my life, and making photos is what really drives me.  While I have done my share of digitally-based images, film is where my head is, and where I enjoy the process the most.The older I get, the more I acknowledge that someday this will all end.  At 62, I think I have about a decade or so to really immerse myself into what I love.  Perhaps, like Imogen Cunningham, I'll be wielding a camera into my 90s, but who knows what the future holds.  So, I am out shooting a bit almost every day, and now that I am in North Carolina, there are many places that I'd like to photograph that are within just a few hours of driving. I live very close to Asheville, and it's a great place to take a quick drive and test out cameras and film, but also has many photographic subjects that will keep my attention. You will see more camera and film stock reviews ahead, as well as more of my photography. I am as enthused by photography as I was 20 years ago, but now, with the mantle of experience, I can write  about a lot more than I could then.  I know that you CAN teach an old dog new tricks, as I have recently become unafraid of disassembling lenses to clean them, and I owe my thanks to those helpful people that put up the YouTube videos. I had a well-used, 85mm f/1.8 Nikkor-H portrait non-AI lens that had a big blob of fungus dead center.  After viewing some online videos, I knew that I could easily fix the problem.  Once I got the lens apart, the fungus was removed from the back of the forward lens group and the front of the rear lens group.  I used ammonia solution, wiped it with lens tissue and cotton swabs, then used Isopropyl alcohol for a final clean, dusted, and put everything back together.  The lens now looks fantastic. It had been AI-modified, so I'll be using it on one of my Nikons to give it a good workout.The 85mm disassembled lens. Minolta X-570, Ilford Delta 100 filmSpeaking of fixing things, last week I replaced the faulty capacitor in my Minolta X-700.  I last used the camera in May or June, and it had been reliable at the time.  I took it out to test some film, and realized that things were not good.  I had a box of Minolta X-370s, and an X-570 that also needed the fix, so I finally ordered 100 of the 220 microfarad 4v capacitors from Digi-Key.  At less than 15 cents each per hundred, it was worth buying enough to last for whatever repairs may lie  ahead.  Anyhow, only one of the repaired Minoltas still had a problem, but it was not capacitor-related.  The rest are all working great.  Aside from the desoldering/soldering aspect, it's an easy repair.  My next repair project is getting several Canon QL-17s working - at least in manual mode.So, what's next?More of the same, with film and camera reviews. Personal insights, examples of my work, and of course, whatever photographically-related topics that may come up.By the way, if you have not yet seen the documentary about Jay Maisel titled \"Jay Myself\" -- you should.  It's on Amazon video, and the rental is $3.99. It's a glorious movie about Jay's long career and the selling of his home and studio that was housed in an old bank building in the Bowery district of New York City.  It's hard to fathom all of the things Jay collected, and why, but there is no doubt of his success as a commercial photographer.  I think you'll find some things that resonate as he describes his career and his thought process about shooting.  It's great that he allowed himself to be the subject of the documentary, and I laughed a lot as he interacted with the cinematographers. Finally, I'd like to say thank you to all of you that have followed  Random Camera Blog, and I hope that you have found it to contain some useful information over the years!"},
{"title": "Creativity with the Nikon 1V1", "date": "Sunday, October 13, 2019", "text": "With all the hoopla about the new mirrorless Nikon Z system, I just shrug my shoulders and say \"meh.\"   I have enough glass and bodies for 35mm Nikons that I can't get all caught up in the ever-expensive staircase to the \"next\" system.  I already own one Nikon mirrorless camera and lens system, and it's the Nikon 1.  What? That piece of crap?  Those cameras made for \"soccer moms\"?I purchased a Nikon 1J1 and 1V1 and lenses back in 2013.  I liked the small size, the ability to change lenses, and the ability to adapt other lenses to these pocketable cameras.  Yes, these cameras have their quirks, and Nikon has a reputation for dumbing-down consumer-level cameras.  However, I love using the Nikon 1 cameras with a c-mount adapter, as the image circle is perfect for the sensor size.  C-mount lenses are usually fairly cheap, and can come from 16mm movie cameras as well as older video camera systems.  I have several favorites that I enjoy using for certain types of photography, such as the examples that will follow.  Of course, with any lens that does not electronically connect to the Nikon 1 body, one can only use manual mode.  As one gets used to a lens, it becomes pretty easy to gauge the exposure, and you also have immediate feedback.  The small size of the camera makes it quite easy to carry, and I like the 1V1 because it has an electronic viewfinder as well as rear LCD screen.   You'll note that I taped over the camera info on the front, as well as the mode select wheel on the back.  Taping that over keeps me from accidentally changing the mode. Ten megapixels is fine.  I have made and sold some nice prints from this camera.Today we went to the North Carolina Arboretum to see the Bonsai Show, and it was fantastic.  The camera allowed me to photograph the trees not as they are, but as something a bit more isolated from the surroundings.  I shot in b&w because that's how I wanted them to be seen.   The grounds of the Arboretum are also really nice, and today was just a bit wet, so that the water gave things a bit of a sheen."},
{"title": "Holga Week 2019!", "date": "Monday, September 30, 2019", "text": "Well, Holga Week is almost upon us, as October 1-7 is Holga Week, meaning that it starts tomorrow!    It was not too long ago that we thought the Holga was dead.  In 2015, we were told that it was no longer going to being manufactured, but alas, in late 2016, we were told that no, the 120N was going to be manufactured again, but in a different factory, thanks to Freestyle Photo. I have been using the basic Holga since about 2002.  In the beginning, they were very inexpensive, and as cameras go, they still are relatively cheap to own. I recall buying one new for $15, but now the 120N sells for about $40.  It's still my favorite low-fi camera for a lot of reasons, and I own a half-dozen of the 120 models.   I have owned the Holga 120 wide pinhole, and still have the Holga 135 pan and Holga 135.  Their plastic construction and plastic lens is about as basic as you can get. Yet, the images made with them can be jaw-dropping beautiful.  Just take a look at the Holga images from Michael Kenna, and you'll see what I mean.  Yes, people have maligned the Holga for its cheapness, but I say it's because they don't understand that it's just a tool.  I have exhibited Holga images at several shows over the years, and still feel that the Holga is a camera that lets one be creative and it just takes a while to figure out how to make it work its magic. Tall Ships, Marquette, MI 2016Kalamazoo, MI,  2016Fishtown, Leland, MI, 2016 Fishtown, Leland, MI, 2016 Amenia, NY 2016Letchworth State Park, NY, 2016The Holga 120N is easily modded, and a quick web search will reveal a lot of ways that it's been modified by people. This summer I modified one my Holgas to have a hexagonal image mask.  I am doing a long-term project with it, and hope to have some interesting results to share later this year.  A lot of people have asked if the Holga is a good introduction to medium format photography.  My answer is no.  Your expectation of medium format is a larger, more detailed negative -- and you'll get that with a twin-lens reflex as the entry to medium format.  The Holga and the Diana and similar low-fi 120 cameras will give you something, but you need to know the limitations and make them work for you in composition, lighting, and subject. Holga Pinhole 120W, Ann Arbor, 2015Another point is that because the Holga has limited adjustments for exposure, you can easily tape a colored orange, yellow, or red gel over the lens to compensate in b&w film, or use a Neutral density filter for color (and yes, it works for b&w, too).   You can also use an external flash for poorly lit situations, or use the B setting while on a sturdy tripod for long exposures.  An adapter allows you to use studio strobes for anyone wishing to do so. Mason, MI, 2014While the Holga is basically a box camera, it is far easier to use than a Kodak Brownie, easily modified, and takes readily available 120 film.  In bright daylight, 100 ISO film is fine, bit 400 ISO film will be fine in most situations.  If you haven't used a Holga before, don't sweat it.  Before long, you'll appreciate its quirky features, and think less about the use, and more about the image.  Light leaks?  I just use artist's black masking tape or gaffer tape.  My biggest fear is that the back will come loose, so I use gaffer tape over the metal clasp on each side to avoid that.So, get out that Holga, whatever type it is, and shoot away this week!Holga 135 Pan,  Sharon Twp., MI 2012"},
{"title": "Batteries and Cameras!", "date": "Thursday, September 19, 2019", "text": "I thought it might be useful to publish a post with useful information about film cameras and batteries.  After handling many hundreds of cameras over the course of years of  selling estates and getting cameras ready for the FPP School Donation Program, as well as doing my own thing with my own photography, I find that it's been an overlooked topic, so I hope that you find this a helpful resource.A typical manual SLR needs just  1.5 - 3V to run the exposure systemOne of the things about using film vs digital cameras, is that in general, film cameras need far less power than their digital counterparts. Don't forget that that digital wonder is basically a small computer with a viewing screen, operating an auto-focus system.  All that takes a considerable amount of stored energy in a battery such that digital cameras usually operate with rechargeable Lithium-ion (Li-on) or Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries.  Since film cameras usually need far less power, they typically use small button or penlight cells. In fact, film cameras that lack meters or any electrical operation do not need any battery power at all. A Nikon F only needs a couple of button cells to operate the Photomic head with a meter.  It can easily be used without any battery power whatsoever. An Argus C3 doesn't need a battery, nor does a Leica M3.  Most SLR cameras that were sold before the late 1970s only need a battery to power the light meter, and lacking that, work just fine without power, although you may need an external light meter or maybe you just want to use Sunny-16 or the Black Cat Exposure Chart.  Once the 1980s kicked in, cameras became more sophisticated, and required more power, especially if the camera is an auto-focus model.  All those little motors in the lenses, film winding/rewinding, exposure systems, and flashes require more power, which led to larger batteries or battery packs in the camera bodies.  In many SLR systems, an external winder may use 4-8 AA cells, which of course adds significant weight.  As manufacturers refined the winding systems, by the time auto-focus SLRs became available, the power to run them was contained in a 6V battery, or 2 3V batteries that fit easily into the grip.Adding automation requires more computing/battery power.Light meters have typically required one or two button cells in a camera. Before the 1980s, cameras that required power for the light meter almost always used Mercury cells.  The reason is that Mercury cells gave out a continuous 1.35 V and lasted a long time, and when they went dead, that was it. There was no slow decline in voltage that would give bad meter readings. Then, Mercury compounds were found to leach into the waste systems in landfills, etc., and the Mercury cells were banned.  Probably far more cells were used in those light-up sneakers that kids wore than all the cameras ever made. Anyhow, that was the end of them, and older cameras that used those cells were often replaced with newer models by the owners, or the owners scoured the stores for old stock Mercury cells. Old stock cells were still available online until at least 2002.Cell versus BatteryPeople often call 1.5 v cells batteries, but technically, they are not. A battery is a group of cells producing a larger output of power than a single cell.  Button cells, AA, AAA, C, D cells are not batteries.  A 9V transistor battery IS a battery, as are any of the batteries that are more than 1.35 or 1.5V. Your 12 volt car battery contains a bunch of lead-acid powered cells that when joined together, provides 12 volts. Generally, we just lump these power sources under the term battery in common usage, but it's good to know the difference.Button CellsButton cells are extremely common in film cameras, especially SLRs, where they typically power the meter and some electronics.  They are ubiquitous, and their compact size and 1.5V output usually has them installed in cameras in pairs, so that they provide a 3V output.  The most common size is the Alkaline LR-44 cell, followed by the 76S - which is identical in size to the LR-44, but is a Silver-Oxide cell that provides 1.55V with a longer life than the LR-44. A less common button cell in later cameras is the PX-625A. It's now mostly used to replace the PX-625 Mercury cells, but it has a higher voltage than the cell it replaces which may cause meters to be a stop or so off in the readout.AAA and AA cellsYes, these are what us old-timers call penlight batteries.  They are most typically used to power flashes, and in many older point-and shoots, they provide all the power for the camera functions.  Some auto-focus SLRs used them too. The Nikon F100, N90, N8008, and the N2000 all use AA cells as they provide enough power for many rolls of film before they poop out.  In addition, the AA and AAA cells are easy to find, unlike some of the esoteric batteries that I will now discuss.Lithium batteries.These batteries use more modern technology to deliver lots of power yet, remain compact enough to use in a camera. The late 1980s saw these start to be used in a variety of caameras, but most notably in consumer-level auto-focus SLR cameras. There are a bewildering number of battery types out there, and sometimes you'll find an oddball battery that may cost as much as your $15 Nikon that you found at the thrift shop.Nickel Metal Hydride - NiMH BatteriesTypically, these are rechargeable cells, such as AA and AAA.  They can be used in place of the Alkaline cells of the same size, and the prices are very low.  They make a lot of sense for power-hungry flash units, and can usually be recharged a at least a hundred times before they need to be replaced.Oddball Alkaline batteries The first one that comes to mind is the 6V 4LR44 battery which is used in the Canon AE-1 and AE-1 Program, as well as the Pentax 6x7.  Another is the 6V PX27G.  In some cases you can take 4 LR-44 cells and tape them together to replace a 4LR44 battery (which seems to be the reason for that designation).  If you have a Yashica rangefinder camera, you'll also be looking for oddball cells, so look at http://yashica-guy.com/document/chrono2.html for more information on your Yashica rangefinder camera.Nickel-Cadmium cellsNiCds were popular in the 1970-80s for rechargeable battery packs, especially in professional cameras such as the Hasselblad EL, the Rolleiflex SLX, and in various flash units.  They fell out of favor when Lithium-ion and Ni-MH cells became more common and cheaper in the 1990s.  NiCds also have fewer recharge cycles than the newer technologies.  However, in some of the cameras that required them, you can still source re-built NiCd packs.  Cadmium is a toxic metal, and the old cells need to be disposed of safely.  Some cameras that took AA alkaline cells warn against using NiCd cells because they typically only provide 1.2V each.What about those cameras (and light meters) that used Mercury Cells?There are a few solutions:1. Replace the cell(s) with an Alkaline equivalent.  The PX-625A is going to be the most common replacement.  Of course, it will provide 1.5, not 1.3 volts, and may affect your meter reading.  Some cameras use a circuit that the higher voltage still gives an accurate reading. You can compensate with the cameras that are affected by setting your ISO dial to a one stop lower setting.  That is, if you are using ISO 400 film, set the dial to ISO 200.  To be honest, with C-41 films and most black and white films, there is enough latitude that it won't make a huge difference.  You can check it against sunny-16 using a gray card and see what your meter reads. If it's off, you'll know what direction to change it.2. Replace with a Wein cell - these are basically a modified Zinc-air hearing aid cell with an adaptor to fit the PX-625 chamber.3. Replace with an appropriate-sized Zinc-air hearing aid cell, and use a spacer to keep the cell in place in the battery chamber. The Duracell 675 hearing aid battery will work in many of the cameras and light meters that require a mercury cell. You may have to shim it in place to not move around.4. Purchase an MR-9 adapter (http://www.criscam.com/) and use a 76S or LR-44 cell.  The MR-9 adapter contains a diode that drops the voltage to 1.3V, and while it may seem a bit pricey, it can be moved from camera to camera as needed.  It's the best solution if you want to use a Luna Pro light meter.5. You can use the camera without powering the light meter, and use an external meter instead.  However, some cameras, such as the Nikon FE, require power to fire the shutter at any speed because the aperture-priority mode requires power, whereas the Nikon FM is fully manual, and the shutter can work without power. The Pentax K1000 and the Pentax Spotmatics are also fine without using a battery for the meter, as are most M42-mount SLRs.  Many of the older Canon  SLRs such as the FTb work fine battery-less.  You just have to use an external meter.NOT ALL CAMERAS NEEDED BATTERIES FOR METER POWERThere are numerous cameras that used solar cells to power the exposure system.  The Olympus Trip 35, Konica EYE, and the Canon DEMI are good examples.  Most of the examples date from the 1960s and 70s.  A ring of cells around the front of the lens is a sure bet that the camera is powered by a Selenium meter.STORAGEIt makes good sense to store your camera without the cells or battery in it if you are not going to use it for awhile.  This holds especially true for cameras that use AA aand AAA cells - which will leak over time and ruin the camera.  I can't stress this enough. I have seen far too many contacts ruined to the point of no-return by leaking AA cells.  Whether it's a camera or a flash unit, remove the cells before you put it away for any length of time.  Button cells seem much less likely to cause problems in storage, nor do Lithium batteries.  The real culprits are the AA and AAA cells which can do the damage when they leak over time.You can store fresh batteries in in the fridge if you wish to prolong their storage life, but I have never tried it to see if it makes a difference.  Certainly high-heat will degrade them, since chemical reactions are accelerated by higher temperatures.BUYING BATTERIESWith the advent of digital photography, the market for camera batteries shifted to rechargeables, and the prices for non-rechargeable camera batteries have gone up.  If you look for a CR123A battery at your local store, be prepared for sticker shock.  I buy most of my button cells and Lithium batteries online, either via Amazon or eBay.  A pack of 100 LR-44 cells can be had for less than $15 online.  There are plenty of online sources for batteries, but I still buy my AA and AAA cells  locally.BATTERY CROSS-REFERENCE CHART - Not all manufacturers use the same numeric designation for a particular size, but this chart will be helpful.CAMERAS AND POWER SOURCES (obviously NOT a complete list, but it's a starting point)PX-625 Mercury cells:NIKON - F Photomic prism, Nikkormat FT, FTN;CANON- QL-17, EXEE, F-1, FT QL, FTb, FX, Canonet 28, TL, TLb, TXOLYMPUS - OM-1LEICA - CLMINOLTA - SR-T series, Hi-Matic 7, 7S, 7SII, 9;PETRI - Color 35,KONICA - Auto S, Auto S2, Auto S3, Autoreflex T, Autoreflex TC, C35, FP,KOWA SE, SET; ROLLEI 35,  YASHICA TL-Electro-X,PX-400 Mercury cells A great number of Pentax Spotmatics used this size Mercury cell.  However, you can use a silver-oxide cell without fear of affecting the exposure accuracy.  The Spotmatics use a bridge circuit so that whether the source is 1.35V or 1.5V, you'll get the same result.  I recommend using a 392 (LR-41) silver-oxide cell for the Spotmatic SP series, and a PX625A for the Spotmatic F.PX-27 Mercury batteries (5.6V)MINOX LX, Minox 35 series;ROLLEI 35 TE, ROLLEI 35 SE, ROLLEI 35 LEDLR-44 or S-76 cells (1.5V) (Typically there are 2 in series, for 3V total.

{"title": "One Roll Review- Dubblefilm's Moonstruck", "date": "Tuesday, September 10, 2019", "text": "It's hard to keep up with what's going on in the altered film market, with so many new releases from at least four sources.  Altered films are standard color C-41 films produced by Kodak and Fuji that are then subjected to either a chemical process or modified with laser or other light to become something altogether different from the standard emulsion.  Companies such as Dubblefilm, Yodica, Revolog, and Kono!, have brought these to market to bring some fun, serendipity, and zaniness to film shooters.  Perhaps you are looking for something different to change up your shooting, and one of the altered films may be just the thing.  First of all, none of these companies actually manufacture film. They are treating ho-hum everyday color films such as Kodak Gold 200 with whatever process they are using to give you something different.  Color shifts, weird patterns, or bands of color may be the result. Maybe that unpredictability isn't your thing, but I can bet that it will appeal to people that are looking for something fun and different.I have only tried Revolog's Tesla film prior to using the Dubblefilm. It was for a film-swap event with the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, and I was really surprised and pleased with the results.  Redscale is a popular way to shoot color differently, but the film has not been altered, just re-spooled so that the light passes through the film base before reaching the emulsion. Dubblefilm is owned by Adam Scott, and the film is shipped from Europe.  Expect to pay far more than you would for a standard roll of C-41 color film.  Like I said, it's not for everyone.  Any of the altered films range from $10-$15/roll US. Considering that the film has been pre-treated, etc., I think that the price is reasonable.  I purchased my roll of \"Moonstruck\" at Camera Mall in Ann Arbor, and shot it in late May 2019.  Dubblefilms are available at the FPP store as well as Freestyle Photo.I loaded the film into my Canon AE-1 Program, and shot it on the streets of Yspilanti and Ann Arbor MI.  I sent it out to The Darkroom for developing, and I scanned the negatives in just this morning. Overall, I really didn't know what to expect, since I hadn't looked at any other results online until today.Dubblefilm's lineup has changed, and Moonstruck is no longer available.  Like any of these altered films, how you expose it, your choice of subject, and the light source may give different results compared to what others have achieved.  It uses standard C-41 processing, and you may want to scan it yourself to avoid machine scans that try to \"normalize\" the results.Here is a sample of the images that I got from my scans.  I did do minor brightness/contrast adjustments, but no color adjustments.Overall, I think the results are interesting, with red hues really popping.  The images do give me a different look than conventional color film, and since the production of the altered films involve repeatable processes, I can see where someone may want to order a batch of any particular film and be assured of getting similar results as they shoot it. Also, since these films are produced in small batches, you may not be able to get more of a certain type of effect if it is sold out.  So, my suggestion is to buy a few rolls if you like a certain effect. Almost all of the altered films have examples on Flickr. Are altered films just a fad or are they here to stay?  So long as there is a market for them, I suppose the sellers will keep making them.  But, as with any of these operations, they are just a few people (or only one) doing all the work to get something magical in your camera.  Expect that any particular film may not be available in a year from now.   I find that they are fun, and certainly can add something different to your photography."},
{"title": "Trees...", "date": "Saturday, September 07, 2019", "text": "I have always  been fascinated with trees -- their form, the shadows that result from them, and the fantastic moods that they can create, along with whatever weather is impacting them. Of course, as we now head towards autumn later this month -- the autumnal equinox, many trees are starting to exhibit that change towards the fall colors that we so love to see.   I grew up in the Adirondacks of New York, and even as a child, I loved the big sugar maples along our driveway blazing forth with brilliant oranges and reds.  In the northeast, fall was a glorious time of year with crisp mornings and slightly warm afternoons, until heavy frosts took their toll and the leaves dropped like snowflakes.  When my wife and I moved to Michigan in 1981, fall color was a bit of a disappointment in the lower part of the state, as the predominant oak-hickory forest was more subtle in its colors.  One really needs to travel north in Michigan to see the wonderful climax of color that's found in aspen-birch-maple forests.  Now, we are living in the mountains of Western North Carolina, and this will be our first fall and winter in the South.  I know that we will get some good color here in late October, and I look forward to shooting it and traveling around the nearby Appalachians.\"A woodland in full color is awesome as a forest fire, in magnitude at least, but a single tree is like a dancing tongue of flame to warm the heart.\" -- Hal BorlandHowever, trees are more than just color. Think of the myriad of forms and the different times of the year that a deciduous tree can look so different, and the arrangement of branches makes a species identifiable in the field.  When I was a forestry student, we had to identify at least 75 species of trees and shrubs by their leaves, fruit, buds, bark, etc., and of course also know their Latin names.  That course was a lot of fun, and also quite challenging.  I have never regretted any of those hands-on field classes in botany and zoology. All have been a part of my world since, and while I may not always know what a plant or an insect is, I know how to find out.   My point is, that you have two eyes, yet many people don't know how to look.  As a photographer, you should be seeing more than just the forest -- you also need to pick out the trees.  Seeing and understanding what you are seeing makes for a better image.  Deciphering the scene before you press the shutter button can result in a more  meaningful image.  I'm not saying I do that all the time, but when I do, I know that I am more in control of the final result on film or the sensor.Sometimes, the shapes of the trees just resonate with me, and it's just using my intuition and imagination that propels me through the creative process.  I immerse myself in the little world of that place and time, and sometimes, I come away with some great images.  But it's not all about the image -- being in the woods -- in the moment -- with nature, is a refreshing connection with the earth.  I always felt some connection, and it's taken me years to appreciate just how essential that connection is to well-being and to creativity.\"To really feel a forest canopy one must use different senses, and often the most useful one is the sense of imagination.\" -- Joan Maloof Lately, I have been more captivated with trees and their shapes, and here in North Carolina, the trees in the mountains can exhibit some fantastic shapes.  I hope to get a portfolio together in the next year or two and see where that obsession goes.\"I often lay on that bench looking up into the tree, past the trunk and up into the branches. It was particularly fine at night with the stars above the tree.\" -- Georgia O'KeeffeHere is a small selection of my images that showcase trees.  I hope that you enjoy them."},
{"title": "The Minolta AF-C compact P&S", "date": "Tuesday, August 27, 2019", "text": "I did not know about this camera until several months ago, when I was working on cataloging cameras from an estate.  I ended up with it, and due to the move to North Carolina, I had put any reviews on hold. Finally, I have been able to develop the roll that I shot with it early in the summer, and here goes my review.The Minolta AF-C -- an automatic P&S, looks a bit like an Olympus XA and a Lomo LCA.  In truth, it's more like a Nikon 35AF, as there are no real controls of the exposure.  It's a compact 35mm camera with a detachable flash that is very similar in operation to the flashes on Olympus XA series of cameras. In use, it reminds me a bit of a Lomo LCA with the lens cover sliding up and down to cover the lens.  The only thing you can adjust is the ISO setting and the use of the flash unit.  The camera uses active infra-red for the autofocus, and the exposure is completely automatic. Considering the many compact P&S cameras that were produced in the early 1980s by the likes of Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Ricoh, and others, this camera stands out from all of them with its distinctive styling and compact form factor (only slightly larger than an Olympus XA).  The 35mm f/2.8 lens is a 6 element Minolta lens with good contrast and sharp optics.  It focuses from just under a meter to infinity.The shutter is made by Seikosha, and has a range of 1/8 sec to 1/430 sec.  There is no bulb or time exposure.  The film speed is set manually, and goes from an ISO 25 to 400.  The exposure is automated, and operates from EV 6 to EV 17, or 1/8 sec. at f/2.8, TO 1/430 sec at f/17.A thumb wheel advances the film, making the camera more compact and there is no auto-rewind, but a manual rewind crank, as with the XA series and Lomo LCA. My version had a Quartz Data Back, which I have not tried using as yet.  I'm not a fan of dates on negatives.  The databack makes the camera less svelte and more blocky. The camera is powered by 4 LR-44 cells, or 2 1/3 N cells.  They fit much better than the Lomo LCA arrangement of 4 stacked cells. To operate the camera, you push the front cover down, which uncovers the lens and viewfinder.  Advancing the film cocks the shutter, and if you have enough light you get a green LED in the viewfinder when you press the shutter button halfway -- which also sets the autofocus. If there is low light, you'll get a red LED if a flash is needed.  The flash screws onto the left side of the camera.  It requires 2 AA cells to operate. The self timer is on the front of the camera, and a red light flashes in front when in use.Using the Minolta AF-C was easy, of course, and the lens cover design makes it a pretty rugged little camera. I shot a test roll on Ilford HP-5+ black and white film, and developed it in D-76. One thing I noted that in some of the frames there is a vertical light stripe about 3/4 across the frame.  That must be some sort of light leak, so I should go and check where new foam will be required. That's not unusual for a camera that's over 35 years old.  The camera has a tripod socket, so using it in low light on 400 ISO film is not a problem, though it is limited to 1/8 sec.This camera was a freebie, which I really appreciate, as the ones on ebay  are going from $50 to $155 in working order.  It's not an Olympus XA, but certainly works very well as a fully automatic camera.  It's far better than an often-unreliable Lomo LCA, and it's more compact than the Nikon and Canon offerings from the same time.  I think the camera has a very cool appearance, and does not feel cheap or fragile. Here are some samples from the test roll, all shot in June, 2019."},
{"title": "It's starting to feel like home.", "date": "Saturday, August 17, 2019", "text": "One of the hardest things about moving to someplace that is entirely new is the disruption in my typical routines and activities.  Of course, I would rather be off with my camera somewhere, but there have been many things around the house that need to be done, as well as trips to visit stores for needed items, and I have seen way to much of a Lowe's lately.  In fact, if I don't have to go inside one for another month, I would be a happy man.  However, we are getting our home to fit our needs, and eventually, all that stuff will be behind us.  We are getting to know our neighbors, and in fact, our neighbor Rachel was pleased to see that I had a manual typewriter. So much so, that she dropped off the book Uncommon Type by Tom Hanks.  I have to say that people here are friendlier and more approachable than in Michigan.  The local food scene is wonderful, and there are lots of great local beers.  The weather has been wonderful, and the mountain skies are always interesting.  Do I miss Ann Arbor? No.  It's easy for us to get around and into town, and every day we find new things.  It's really good that we decided to move here, as it has given us a kick in the pants to not be in a rut, and I feel fortunate that we have been able to do this.Reed Creek will be great for some future pinhole workIn the past week, I have been doing some photography in downtown Asheville and Weaverville, and found a lovely place to visit at the Univ. of North Carolina Botanical Gardens, about 10 minutes from our house.  Reed Creek runs through the gardens, and the terrain is quite interesting.  Getting out for some \"me\" time is important, as I need to explore the area, and think about the type of photography that I want to do. I'm away from all of my old photo friends in Ann Arbor, and it will take a while to have that same film user community here that I had back in Michigan.   Lance King, from Tennessee, contacted me a couple of weeks ago and told me about a cool place in Marshall, NC and gave me some contact information.  I contacted the owner of the Makers Circle, Susan Patrice, and yesterday I drove over to meet her and see what the place was all about.  It's only about a 25 minute drive from my house, and it's in the lush mountains NE of Marshall.Susan Patrice with one of her modded cameras for doingcircular negatives.Susan Patrice runs the Makers Circle, and it's an amazing place with an alt-process darkroom, regular darkroom, a big digital work space, and room to house people that want to do a residency there. She's extremely knowledgeable and is a fantastic working photographer.  Her work is immediately notable in that most of her images are circular. We spent almost 3 hours talking photography, and it was such a great visit for me.  I may end up using the darkroom there until mine gets set up. It is amazing  that there is such a great resource just a short drive from my house!  I learned a bit about local resources too, and my next visit will be to Ball Photo in Asheville, where they apparently have LOTS of film cameras and accessories. Today, we finally went to the North Asheville Tailgate Market, which is a farmer's market that sets up on Saturdays on the UNC Asheville campus. One word- fantastic - describes the market.   It really was a feast for all the senses.  It reminded me of the Farmer's Market that I went to in Portland, OR, though not as extensive.  We bought some produce, some bread and cheese, some things to plant, and I spent $3.50 to buy a huge bell pepper that Weston would have envied.  Now I need to set up some lighting and space to photograph it on 6x7.  Then, we'll eat it.So, yes, this is starting to feel like home, and I am looking forward to many new adventures."},

The cool thing is that the driver's license is good for 8 years!  In any case, I have been way too busy with things other than photography, though I have shot a bit when I have had the chance.  Last week a particularly foggy morning gave me the idea to go into Weaverville and visit the Lake Louise park where I not only got some nice foggy photos, but also discovered there is a nice waterfall not far from the road.  As we get more settled in, I'll be able to do more photography, and I look forward to that.  We get our washer and dryer delivered Saturday, which will be a welcome event!  It will be many months...maybe a year before I have a darkroom constructed, but in the meantime, I can develop film in the bathroom in the basement. A year ago, the idea of moving out of Michigan to NC was still somewhat abstract.  The reality is that I am now here, and I am embracing the the change.  Sometimes it takes a major event to change your life, and it can be a positive or a negative thing.  I am fortunate that this is a positive change, but it doesn't mean that it is easy.  Eventually, all my stuff will be where it should be, and I'll be doing some good work with the cameras.   I do love these mountains in NC, and the people we have met have been very welcoming and very nice.  We look forward to many new adventures!"},

I sure have a lot of binders filled with negatives, and after we arrive, I plan on going through the last 10 years worth and doing some printing as well as posting online.  I boxed up much of the RC and fiber-based printing paper that was in my darkroom -- it will get used down the road, and I am sure some of it will be given away when I am in NC.  My film fridge will get emptied the day before we move, and the film put into a cooler that I'll transport.  Most of my cameras are already in locked  plastic totes that will be handled by the movers.  I'll be driving down with a couple of camera bags, as well. Overall, things have gone smoothly.

{"title": "Looking Back and Moving On", "date": "Monday, July 01, 2019", "text": "In two days, it will a year since my best friend, Marc Akemann, left this earth.  I still think of him, and he's still a part of my life.  I have been helping Coleen with Marc's photographic estate, and since I am moving soon, I won't be able to be as helpful as I would have liked to be, but I think my buddy Bill will be able to pick up where I left off.  Lately, I have had some time to scan in a bunch of film that Marc shot but never developed.  The Darkroom developed the C-41 and E-6 film, and I am slowly working on the B&W.  Now that all of my darkroom stuff is packed away, further work will have to wait until after we move. One roll of film was shot in 2013, and the roll appears to have shots from two of our trips on it.  I think the following photos were taken at a motel in Mackinaw City or Munising. I think it's the latter, because we both are dressed for cooler weather, and one trip was in June (not cold), and the other, late October.  Any how, Marc had set up his Nikon FA to do self-timer shots of the two of us.  The actual sequence is a bit bizarre, considering that Marc is no longer with us. I know that it looks like I am talking to a ghostly Marc, but it's because he was not situated when the shutter fired.  Nonetheless, I think Marc would have agreed that he looks non-corporeal. We will be moving to Weaverville, NC on July 20, assuming all goes as planned with the closing on the new house.  We also had great news this evening, as it looks like our house has an offer that will be acceptable to us.  So, I have been busy boxing things up during the past week.  The darkroom is empty, all cleaned up, and is clean enough to wash a baby in.  I still have many books to box up, and oh yeah, the rest of the house needs to be packed.  Our movers arrive on  7/18, and should be done on the 19th.  It's nice to not have to pack in a rush, and get things done in an orderly manner. Many Nikon lenses packed up. These are just the negatives/slides from 2016-2019The darkroom, back in early March.The now empty darkroomTaken a few weeks ago. Most of the shelves on the sides are now empty.I am looking forward to moving.  Our new house is only 10 minutes from Asheville, and a mile from Weaverville.  After all this packing/moving/unpacking is over, it will be time for a well-deserved vacation!    We'll miss our friends, of course, as well as some things about Ann Arbor.  It will take a while getting used to our new state, and while I'll miss the beauty of the Michigan lake shores, I'll find new vistas and lots of nature in North Carolina to fill up my viewfinder."},

If you see one, buy it.", "date": "Friday, June 28, 2019", "text": "I thought I'd seen all of the compact 35mm cameras made, until I picked up this Pentax UC-1.  I didn't know Pentax  made a camera so small, with such elegance and such a sharp wide-angle lens.  I suppose UC-1 means \"Ultra Compact 1.\" but I could be wrong.  Maybe it means \"Utterly Cute\" or maybe it stands for \"Use Continuously.\"  I was eager to put a test roll of film through this little beauty, also known as the Espio Mini outside of North America. The UC-1 is a clam-shell front camera, much like the Olympus Stylus Epic.  It's really a surprise to me that Pentax produced the UC-1, as it is so different than the typical Pentax P&S cameras that I have seen.  While it compares well with the Olympus Stylus Epic, it's really an even better camera in my opinion.Strong Points of the UC-1Compact size and ergonomics - at only 4.2 x 2.3 x 1.4 inches,  and 6 ounces, this camera is truly ultra-compact.  It fits easily in the hand and the controls are easy to see and engage.Wide-ish lens - the 32 mm f/3.5 lens is deadly sharp.  Certainly wider than a 35 - 38mm seen on many compacts.ISO Range - DX coded 35 mm cassettes from 25- 3200.  Non-DX cassettes are assigned an ISO of 25.Focus Range - 1 foot to infinity!Panoramic Mask Function - not for everyone, but nice in a wide-angle camera.Power - 1 CR123A 3v cell. Shutter Speeds - Programmed AE electric shutter with speed approx. l/400sec. -2 sec, Bulb: l/2 sec.- 5 min., Electromagnetic release  The Infrared remote is an option, but with it you can easily shoot in B mode on a tripod for long exposures.  Up to 5 minutes means you could easily use this camera for night skies.  Flash Control - Built-in auto flash with red-eye reduction mode, Automatic flash emission in low luminance or a backlight situation, Flash-ON:Daylight-Synchro/Slow-Shutter-Speed Synchro (up to 2 sec.), Flash-OFF:Flash override, Bulb Synchro: l/2 sec.- 5 min.Auto film loading, winding, and rewinding at end of roll.Lots of control and informationWeak PointsThe LCD on mine is only partly operational.The chrome finish is attractive, but it does wear off.  Not a common model, which means prices on eBay are quite high -- over $100 for working cameras, higher for mint, and don't forget to search under Espio Mini! That's a debatable weak point if you are a seller.ResultsBack in December I loaded a roll of Fuji Superia 200 in the camera  and went downtown to shoot the roll.  I forgot about the roll, and it sat with others until a batch went to The Darkroom for developing. I have to say that I am impressed with the results.  This is certainly a camera that could be easily carried in a pocket and taken out in a moment's notice to shoot with.  Right now, the camera is packed away for my move to NC, but I will certainly be using it more in the future.  The sharp lens, excellent exposure control, compactness and ergonomics make this camera a real treasure. If UC-1, buy it!"},
{"title": "Strange Films from Film Washi - Film F and Film S", "date": "Monday, June 24, 2019", "text": "shot with Washi SA few months ago I received two rolls of film to test for the Film Photography Project-- Film Washi's \"newest\" films - Washi F and Washi S.   Now, you already know that I am someone that likes to play with oddball film stocks, and these two films certainly fit that description.  First, let me acquaint you with them from the information furnished by Film Washi.Film Washi touts itself as the world's smallest film company.  Based in France, Film Washi first came to our attention with the hand-coated Washi films that were produced on thin Washi paper.  From the Film Washi site:   \"Founded in 2013 by Lomig Perrotin in a closet of his Parisian flat, Film Washi grew up while staying a one-man-business. The company’s facilities are now located in Saint-Nazaire, on the western coast of France.The company’s ethos is based on values of innovation, simplicity and ecology. The adopted processes link it to the Maker and DIY movements: recycling takes an important part in the making of films, and many production tools (including 120 rollers, 135-cartridge loader, or IR glasses) have been made out of recycled parts.With more than 25.000 films sold since it was created, Film Washi stays a relatively minor player on the analog photography market. It does not try to compete against major film makers, but to complement them instead, offering photographers a different, novel approach to analog photography.\"Back to the films...Both of these film stocks are emulsions originally produced for a far different purpose than conventional pictorial photography. Film Washi describes them as:shot with Washi SF- Film F is a special fluorographic x-ray film used for mass lung disease diagnoses. Being coated without anti-halation layer, this unique film offers a high diffusion effect and beautiful grain.  The suggested ISO for this film is 100, and it is an orthochromatic film that is insensitive to red.S - Film S is used for motion picture sound recording which needs ultra high definition guaranteed by an anti-halation layer between the film base and the emulsion layer.  The film has almost no grain with high contrast, and while it is panchromatic, it is not completely red sensitive, topping out at 620 nm.  The recommended ISO is 50, and because of light piping, you should load the film in dim light and advance a few frames before shooting with it.Now, for my reviews...Film SI shot Film S on May 1, using my Nikon N2000 with a 28mm Nikkor lens. It was an overcast day in Ann Arbor with diffuse lighting.  Many of my photos featured architectural subjects with lots of detail. I figured that if the film was fine-grained and high contrast, I would probably be giving it a good test.  The film was developed by The Darkroom so that they could test their developer with this oddball film.  The film was developed in clip tests, with times set as 6.5 minutes, 7 minutes, and 8.5 minutes.  On the light table, I would say that the longer development time yielded the best overall results.   The Darkroom used Ilfotec DD at 1:4 dilution for their developing.  The Ilfotec DD RS is equivalent to Kodak's T-max RS developer.I have to say that I am absolutely thrilled with the sharp, contrasty and nearly grainless images from the Film S.  It reminds me of Kodak's Technical pan film, but without having to use a special developer. The architecture subjects were perfect for this film.  The ISO of 50 isn't all that slow, and the shots were all done hand-held.  The film's strengths really showed in the images that are crisp and highly detailed, with really good tonal separation.Film FOn May 3, I shot the Film F in Chelsea, Michigan, also with the N2000 camera but with with the Lensbaby Velvet 56 lens.  The sky was  bright overcast.  The film was also developed by The Darkroom as before, with times of 7.5 minutes, 8.5 minutes, and 10 minutes.  Based upon the film on the light table, I'd say that all of the times ended up similarly, though the 10 min. time was certainly denser.  I can see that the film certainly has a similar response to sunlight as the Polypan F film that also lacks an anti-halation layer.marks on top from film clip testnote the flare from the white surfaces, what I call blooming diffusionFilm F is more of an \"atmospheric\" film -- there is of course, grain, and the blooming diffusion, especially when you have a white subject, is quite noticeable, as well as the low-contrast.  Now, that does not mean it's a bad thing, and if that is the look you wish to go for, by all means give the film a try.  The lack of an antihalation layer means you'll want to make sure that you use shorter exposures, if possible.  Longer exposures will cause more diffused results, but maybe that's not a bad thing if you are going for that look.  I used the Lensbaby Velvet 56 lens, which also may have contributed to the overall look in the results.  I'll bet the film would be an interesting one to use with models.Finally --This is the beauty of shooting with film.  There is a film for whatever look you want, and not every film will give you the same result.  My takeaway from using these two films from Film Washi is that Lomig Perrotin should be commended for bring interesting and unique film stocks to market.  I don't expect every film to be to my taste and subject matter, and only you can appreciate what these films can do when you try them.  I certainly adore the Washi S film, and want to try more in the future with other subjects and conditions.  [Note:  I fixed the developer information on 6/25, as soon as I found out from The Darkroom]"},
{"title": "The Canon AE-1 Program - just shoot!", "date": "Saturday, June 01, 2019", "text": "Even though I am a committed Nikon user, I do enjoy testing and shooting with  other camera systems. About a decade ago, I somehow got on a Canon SLR kick, and shot a number of Canon SLRs from the 1960s-70s - Canon FTb QL, Canon TL, Canon AV-1, Canon EF, Canon AL-1, Canon T70, Canon Pellix, the A-1, and the F-1.  I really liked the A-1, and it was every equivalent of the Nikon FA, but lacking in the simple control system and metering ability of the Nikon.  I never used a Canon AE-1, as popular as they were, but I recently acquired a Canon AE-1 Program.  I have been shooting with it quite a bit in the past month, and I want to share my thoughts on the camera.  This won't be a complete review of the camera's specifications, history, and operation, as they are easily found elsewhere.First of all, the Canon AE-1 Program (or AE-1P) appeared in 1981, as a successor to the very popular AE-1 that came out in 1976. At the time, few cameras had full automation, or Program mode, which made the AE-1P an improvement over the AE-1, which, like many Canon SLRs, were shutter-priority in the automated mode.  The AE-1P also has manual and shutter-priority too, but I'll bet most users shot in full program mode, with the camera choosing the right shutter speed/aperture setting, allowing you to focus solely on your subject. For frame of reference, the Nikon FE2 came out in 1983, and it replaced the Nikon FE that appeared in 1978. Both of those cameras are Aperture-Priority and Manual mode cameras that are among my favorite manual Nikons. The user still had to select an aperture, and the camera the shutter speed.  The Canon AE-1P basically did away with that user choice thing, because dammit, the metering is VERY good, and in full program mode, I have found every exposure to be what I wanted.This particular example of the AE-1P is all black, making it look like a sleek and professional camera.  It uses FD lenses, and I shot it with a Canon 50mm f/1.8, Canon 85mm f/1.8, and a Canon 24mm f/2.8 lens, as well as a crazy Sigma 16mm semi-fisheye lens.  When the Canon AE-1P was new, it was selling for around $300 in the US. I bought a Pentax MG around 1983 at a Service merchandise store, and had I chosen a Canon AE-1P instead (or a Nikon FE2), I wonder what directions my photography may have gone.  While the Pentax SLR was a pretty competent beginner SLR, it was aperture priority only, with no real manual control, except at 1/100 sec.  It's obvious to me now that the AE-1P was a game-changing SLR, coming out at a time when competitors were also exploring automation, but not all at the same level of excellence.Initially, I found that I was overthinking when I shot with this camera.  Without reading the manual,I assumed that the S setting was for Shutter-priority, but then realized it was for the Self-timer.  I was always wondering if it was working properly, of course.  The shutter has just a bit of a wheeze, but seems to work just fine.  I see the aperture reading but not the shutter speed in the readout in the viewfinder, which was initially disconcerting.  After I developed the first roll of b&w film, my fears were laid to rest, and I just composed and shot with the camera in full Program mode.Viewfinder - The viewfinder of the AE-1P is bright and the center focus area is easily used, with the split image rangefinder surrounded by a microprism rangefinder.  That's a good thing in a camera that has been designed to move the attention to the composition, and not the controls.Handling - I can't find fault with the camera's ergonomics, as the right-hand grip is well-placed and not too big. The film advance lever is smooth and easy to operate, and the shutter button is well-placed.Controls - Everything is where it needs to be. However, the S setting on the top deck still wants me to think that it's not for self-timer. Usually, the self-timer is located on the front of an SLR, but of course, Canon likes to confound people by moving things around.  The A-1 also had the same feature with controls around the advance lever.  The stop-down lever on the front is rather awkward in use, and I'll bet few people actually used it. If there is a control that is missing, it would be exposure compensation. I can see why this camera was so popular. Put in a roll of 35mm film, select the ISO setting, and start shooting.  Compose and shoot.  While this camera's Nikon equivalent is the tiny Nikon EM, the EM did not have any sort of useful manual mode.  The Canon AE-1P is heftier, and in most aspects, a far better camera.  The Canon AE-1P was made for those that want to shoot images with great results, and I have to say that the camera achieved that.  I am no Canon fanboy -- Canon was awful in flash technology, and could never be consistent with control design and placement, even in the EOS film era. However, with the AE-1 and AE-1P, Canon hit a price point and performance point that was ahead of Nikon's offerings - at least in the consumer market.   In the end, though, Canon's complexity was a problem, and cameras like the AE-1 and AE-1P suffer from the effect of age on electronic components, and squealing shutters.  I believe that Canon should have gone with the well-proven and very reliable Copal-Square vertical metal shutters (used on the Canon EF!) that Nikon used.  It wasn't until the T series that Canon abandoned the horizontal cloth shutters for good.    Overall, the Canon AE-1P is a great SLR, and if you find one that works well, buy it.  It's a great street and travel camera, since all you have to do is focus and press the the shutter button to get the shot.  Is it a good learning tool for a class? No.  A Canon FTb QL is a great camera to learn on.  However, it's a great camera to give a kid to shoot with, as the learning curve is very short.I hope to shoot more with this body, and with some Ektachrome later on.  I'll be busier than ever in the coming weeks as we prepare for our move to NC, so it may be a while before the AE-1P gets any use. I'll probably not be blogging a whole lot either, but we shall see!"},
{"title": "TechPan Test with Highly dilute Rodinal", "date": "Thursday, May 23, 2019", "text": "If you have looked through this blog, you'll see that I have long been a fan of Kodak Technical Pan 2415 film.  A few years ago, I acquired a bulk roll of Kodak Technical Pan film that was already in a bulk loader. It has sat around in my basement since then.  Two months ago, I rolled it all up into individual 35mm cassettes, with the intention of selling it on eBay.  But before I can do so, I need to test the film. The expiration date was March, 1990.  So, that film is 30 years old at the very least.  My experience has been that films like TechPan and Kodalith keep pretty well. The low ISO and low grain really helps.  But, unless one develops the films in a low-contrast developer such as POTA, you'll end up with high-contrast black and white negatives with little gradation of gray tones.  In the case of TechPan, I always used the Technidol developer which gave me lovely tonality at ISO 25, with no discernible grain.  Since I have packed up most of my chemicals for an impending move, how could I go about testing the film?  Earlier this week I decided to go ahead and shoot a test roll in my Canon T60, and today, I finally developed the film.  To achieve a low-contrast and keep the gray tones, I used Rodinal.  I used 2 ml of Rodinal in 498ml of water.  I developed for 13 minutes, agitating every minute.  I used a water stop, and fixed in FPP fixer, and the usual water and FPP Archival Wash after fixing. As I opened the developing tank, I could see that yes! I did get images.  As I figured, the negatives were \"thin\", but I knew they should scan pretty well.  This wasn't a stand development, which has been suggested for TechPan in Rodinal.  I wanted to mainly see if the dilution would give me a negative I could scan, and also to see how the film has aged. The negatives were scanned on my Epson V700 Photo flatbed scanner, and in post, I was was able to clean the images up and tweak them in my go-to editing software, Corel Paint Shop Pro.As you can see, these are not too bad, given the TechPan quirks.  I detect some grain, but still, very low. What I do note is some edge fogging, which could be due to the development, my handling, or at worst, the entire roll is like this.  I'll do some more tests to see what is going on.  I think I'll test another roll using Caffenol as a developer, and shoot it with the idea that I want to have a high-contrast negative.   If I find that the next roll is without any problems, I'll probably just sell or trade them direct from here. Kodak's Technical Pan Brochure is here.The Photographer's Formulary sells Developer TD-3, which is a replacement for Kodak's Technidol developer. It does not contain Phenidone.The formula for POTA is:Sodium Sulfite - 30 gramsPhenidone  - 1.5 gramsDistilled water to make 1 liter     - heat the water to 30°C to make the Phenidone dissolve.Develop the TechPan at 20°C  Develop time is 15 minutes, with 5 seconds of agitation every 30 seconds.  Use water stop bath, and typical fixer.  The suggested ISO is 25, but an ISO of 50 may give acceptable results. POTA should be used as soon as possible, and make a new batch each time you want to develop film.Be careful with TechPan film, as it is a thin emulsion on a Polyester base.  Light piping will occur, so load the film indoors and store in black plastic cans.   TechPan can be an amazing pictorial film, and I hope that I'll be able to make the film available to others."},
{"title": "Comrade, Can I Interest You in a Zenit?", "date": "Saturday, May 04, 2019", "text": "Shooting with the Zenit 12XPOver the years, I have owned a few Zenits.  My introduction to this line of Russian SLRs was with the Zenit E (made in the 1970s), which came in a leather never-ready case that smelled fairly awful. That was around 2001.  I probably paid less than $20 for it.  The viewfinder was a bit strange as well.  I later had a Zenit EM (made in the 1970s-80s), and then a more modern, but plasticky Zenit 122 (1990s).  That Zenit was certainly not as ruggedly built as its metal-bodied counterparts. The Zenit 12 XP that I have is now my only M42-mount camera.  I bought it at an antique store in Negaunee, MI for $20 about 5 years ago.  It came with a Helios 44M-4 58mm f/2 lens which is one of those lenses that seem to have a special endearing quality.The Zenit E - my first Zenit, ca. 2002My second Zenith, the Zenit EM, ca. 2006Feature-wise, the Zenits are certainly not innovative, by any means.  The 12XP features B, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, and 1/500 sec shutter speeds.  It might be the Volkswagen of 35mm SLR cameras.  It does feature a standard hot-shoe as well as a PC socket, self-timer, and a meter with diode indicators in the viewfinder.  Metering is stop-down style -- a partial press of the shutter release will activate the meter and actuate the aperture.  If the two diodes are lit simultaneously, then you probably have a correct exposure. The flash sync is at 1/30 sec!   ISO ranges are from 16 to 500.  The all-metal construction of the camera makes it tank-like, but even so, it’s easy to use. The 12XP was manufactured from 1983-1992, and over a million units were produced.Back to the lens -- since the Helios 44M in its various incarnations was put on the Zenits, it may be the most common “normal” lens from a manufacturer out there, at least in M42 mount (made from 1958-1992).  Renowned for its interesting swirly bokeh, rugged construction and affordability, it’s a copy of the Zeiss Biotar 58mm f/2 lens.  Many users praise the lens for it’s buttery bokeh on closeups, and for portraiture.  At 58mm, it’s certainly less wide than a 40mm.    The close-focus of the lens is 18”, and it’s a real pleasure to use. This lens is multicoated (MC), but early versions of the lens may be uncoated or single-coated.My take on the Zenit 12XP is that it’s a no-frills camera with a  great lens that will allow you to concentrate on your subject.  The basic controls are very basic, and with the limited shutter speed selection, it may seem a bit antiquated.  Everything is fully manual, and it also makes it a great camera to learn photography with.  Given the price of Pentax K1000s, a Zenit 12XP ought to be a bargain of you are looking for a basic SLR.  The M42 screw mount has a huge number of lenses available for it, and they usually go for far less than other mounts.Today, the prices on eBay are all over the place.  A 12XP with the Helios 44M lens in very good condition will range from $20 - $90.  The body only for a Zenit TTL - 12 series runs from $15-$40. All excluding shipping, of course. I figure that I did well for what I paid! Since it was made in Russia, it's going to be a more common camera in Europe than the USA.  Some Zenit Es were re-badged under the Kalimar label as the Kalimar SR200.ZENIT Resources:Soviet and Russian CamerasZenit KamerasZenit User manualsUSSR PhotoImages!  I really do like the results from this camera and lens combination.Polypan 50Polypan 50Polypan 50Polypan 50Fuji 200 colorFuji 200 colorFuji 200 colorSvema 125 colorSvema 125 ColorSvema 125 ColorSvema 125 Color Svema 125 ColorDerevPan 100, flashDerevPan 100DerevPan 100"},
{"title": "Using Vintage Cameras.  Some Tips to Follow.", "date": "Saturday, April 20, 2019", "text": "So, you have acquired a bunch of old film cameras from an estate, an attic, or some basement.  Perhaps you know their history of ownership, or perhaps you are totally clueless when and where they came from and how they were stored, and for how long.   You are curious about using them again.  Before you start, five  main factors have to be addressed when using older cameras that might have been sitting unused for a lengthy period of time.ShuttersLight-tightnessBatteries (if needed)FilmOverall conditionThe old Kodak ball-bearing shutters seem tolast forever!1.  Shutters.  Shutters might be as simple as a sector shutter found on a box camera, or as complex as a focal-plane shutter on a single lens reflex camera.  Any camera that hasn't been used in a long while, especially those with between the lens leaf shutters, may need some TLC to get them working acceptably.  Sometimes all that is needed is to repeatedly fire the shutter at a moderate setting, and work the slower shutter speeds in gradually until the shutter appears to be working appropriately.  On  medium-format folding cameras, you can usually unscrew a front lens element to reach the aperture blades  and the shutter,  and a drop of lighter fluid (Ronsonol) or white naphtha will help get things moving. Remember that old rule -- DON'T FORCE ANYTHING!   Brute force will often render a camera useless.  Look for repair examples online, as many people have encountered the same problems, and there may be a step-by-step repair guide available.  Cameras that have sat unused for many years can't be expected to suddenly be fired up without some hesitation. SLRs with focal plane shutters are usually very reliable, but some models that have rubberized silk curtains in the shutter may have problems as they are now getting upwards of 60 years old. I have seen Exaktas with the rubberized curtains in tatters.  In contrast, the focal-plane shutters of 100-year old Graflex large-format SLRs are often just fine.  It all depends on the storage conditions and usage history of the camera. The 35mm SLRs with copal-square shutters are typically less prone to problems over time.  However, if a camera requires batteries for the shutter to function, that provides another avenue of failure. See Number 3.Cloth focal plane shutter, AsahiflexThis is a lovely Nikon SP rangefinder...with a hole in the shutter! Caused by leaving it in the sun withthe f/16 aperture allowing the sun to burn hole through it.Bellows need to be checked on all folding cameras.2. Light-tightness.  Light-tightness is important, or you'll have light leaks on your film.  Bellows cameras should be examined for pinholes.   Shine an LED light into the bellows area in a dark room and see if you can detect any pinholes. Black electrical tape can cover holes in bellows, but it's only a temporary fix. You can dab some black liquid rubber (sold for coating tool handles) or black fabric paint into the bellows material to fix small pinholes.  While I have never done a bellows replacement, there are people that make replacement bellows for old folding cameras and large format view cameras.  If you like origami, you might try to tackle it yourself, as there are online resources for DIY bellows.Cameras with foam in the seals should be checked and the foam replaced if it has hardened or turned into a gummy mess! You can buy adhesive-backed felt or black foam at craft stores, and the thinner the material the better.  Black electrical tape can cover gaps in the back of a camera, but avoid it if possible. Black gaffer's tape is preferable, as it does not leave a sticky residue.  Light seal material for the backs of cameras can easily be made from adhesive backed black felt or thin black foam from the craft store.  Some old cameras merely need a strip of black yarn in a groove. Remove old gummy foam with lighter fluid on the end of a cotton swab and a toothpick, scraping the material away.   Make sure you cover the shutter or lens with a small piece of cardboard taped over the film gate while the back of the camera is open. You don't want residue or tools in there.3. Batteries. Batteries are often the culprit in preventing the use of some older cameras.  Many cameras from the 60s and 70s used mercury cells, which are no longer sold.  The PX-625, for example, was used in many 35mm cameras and light meters,  and supplied a constant 1.35v.   The modern replacement is a PX-625A or LR-9.  Using modern-day cells provide 1.5 volts, which in many cameras, will give inaccurate meter readings.  PX-27 cells delivered 5.6 V, and the modern replacement is a PX-27A or 4LR43, which delivers 6v. With color print or b&w film, you can usually be “close enough” in your exposure that the voltage difference is not significant. You can use the zinc-air hearing aid batteries to use the camera meters, or, better yet, if the camera is going to be used a lot, C.R.I.S. (online) sells an adapter that allows the use of silver batteries.  Their MR-9 adapter might seem pricey, but if you buy one, you can really extend the life of these older, fine cameras.  It also pays to buy the LR-44 1.5v cells online in bulk.  There are other oddball battery types from the past that have no current alkaline or lithium equivalent.   You may have to clean battery contacts that have become oxidized or corroded.  A pencil eraser may not be enough to clean the contacts.  A swab dipped in vinegar and rubbed on the contacts will loosen the crud.  Wipe off the vinegar with another swab and clean with isopropyl alcohol.With the X-700 and related models, a dead capacitor will incapacitatethe camera, even with new batteries.A film haul from 2007. I wish I had saved the Minolta 16 film!4. Film.  35mm film isn't a problem, but many old cameras use sizes no longer being manufactured - 828, 116, 620, 616, 126 etc.  You can sometimes use 120 in 620 roll-film cameras, as the films are the same size, only the spools are slightly different.  How you do it depends on the camera.  Most people re-spool 120 onto 620 spools, and some cameras allow 120 spools in the supply chamber, but 620 for the take-up spool.   120 film is easily purchased at a real camera store or online, and 620 (respooled) can be found at the Film Photography Project online store.  The FPP Store also sells the Camerahack adapters for roll-film cameras, allowing you to use 120 in a 122 film camera,  35mm in a 126 cartridge, etc.  There are no manufacturers currently making 126 film, 127 film, APS film, or Kodak Disc film.  Lomography and the FPP Store are currently selling 110 film, so there is a mini-resurgence in 110 shooting.  If you are relegated to shooting old, outdated film in your camera, remember that most films lose a stop of effective sensitivity every decade.  So, that roll of 400 ISO Kodak Max from 2009 is now rated at ISO 200. Black and white slow to moderate speed films age far better.  I have shot 40 year old Verichrome Pan in box cameras with good results.  Panatomic-X that expired in the 1980s works great now at ISO 25. However,  high-speed color films do not fare as well.Typical Graflex RB - it may work fine, but look for one thattakes currently available film sizes!Polaroid Cameras - at this point I will suggest to only obtain Polaroid 600-series and Time-Zero series (as in the SX-70) cameras.  Any old pre-packfilm cameras are going to be doorstops, and now that Fuji is no longer making the pack film, cameras such as the Polaroid Land 100 and up are not going to be usable. Kodak Instant cameras (not Instamatic) have been filmless for over 20 years. Polaroid Swingers are objects of curiosity, and not usable.  Cameras such as the Polaroid 80A are not usable.5. Overall condition. I have had hundreds of old cameras pass through my hands over the years. It's always unfortunate to see an example of some rare camera beset with grime and crud, mold, cigarette smoke, or rust.  Sometimes it may just need a good exterior cleaning.  However, a camera with lots of dents, mold, and oxidation may indicate that it not worth your time.  It might have been rescued from a lake, a flooded basement, or maybe it was carried off by a tornado.Other potential problems are fungus growing on lenses, corroded battery contacts, mildew on the camera leather, and of course, user unfamiliarity with a camera.  Sometimes not knowing how something works will leave you feeling like it's broken, but in reality, you may just need to know more about the camera.  Mike Butkus has manuals available online and they can be a great help!  Google is also your friend when it comes to these things.  Don't be afraid to search for help that way -- you'll be surprised at how many sources of information are out there.This Ermanox was a rare find and cleaned up wellExterior cleaning -- I use a soft rag with isopropyl alcohol to clean the exterior.  Large cotton-tipped swabs are also useful for hard to reach spots, such as around knobs and dials.  Tape residue or other gooey substances can be removed with \"Goof-Off\".  An old soft toothbrush is useful for \"scrubbing\" the leatherette.  For mold on the camera body or on the lens, vinegar or windex can be used to clean the surface.  Old dirty Bakelite can be scrubbed with a paste of baking soda and a soft toothbrush, and rinsed off with water. For old cameras with real leather on the body or with leather cases, you can use Lexol, a leather cleaning solution easily found in the hardware store.  Rub it in with a soft cloth in an inconspicuous spot first to see how it affects the item you are cleaning.Lastly -- sometimes a camera is just plain broken and not worth fixing, or perhaps it's no longer usable because the film isn't available.  Many old metal-bodied Polaroid cameras fall into the latter category. The classic and even not-so-classic cameras are sometimes art objects on their own, and can be used to decorate, or to create something useful from them.  I have seen Kodak Brownies with their flash units turned into night lights.  The distinctive appearance of old film cameras are something that today's look-alike digital models just don't have."},
{"title": "Derev Pan 400 - A fine-grained, high speed film with great tonality", "date": "Thursday, April 11, 2019", "text": "It's great to have so many 35mm film stocks to choose from these days.  If you are not aware, The Film Photography Project Store started offering some new b&w films very recently.  In mid-March, Mike Raso released three new films, all fresh from Ukraine, that were originally produced for scientific and aerial survey work.  The new films are Derev Pan 100, Derev Pan 200, and Derev Pan 400.  Much to my liking, they are in 36 exposure rolls. The naming of the film, according to Mike, is for the forests of Ukraine, the film's country of origin. All of the films are on a thin Mylar base, and all are fine-grained, with each film having different characteristics.   I have so far only tried the Derev Pan 400, which I am reviewing here.photo courtesy of the FPPRoll one -- Started in January when I  put the cassette into my Canon T60  on a snowy day. I finished it a few weeks later in downtown Ann Arbor, fittingly, while I was there to watch the Garry Winogrand documentary at the Michigan Theater, All Things Are Photographable.  It was definitely a fine movie, and worth seeing if it arrives in your area or is on Netflix.I developed the roll in D-76, diluted 1:1 for 10.5 minutes at 20°C. Roll 2  was loaded into my Leica R4 SLR while at  Lake Lure, NC, and finished also in Ann Arbor.  Development was in straight D-76 for 8 minutes at 20°C.First thing -- Mike advises that because the film is on a thin polyester (Mylar) base, light piping is possible.  On roll 1 it wasn't noticeable because I loaded indoors in subdued light.   Roll 2 was loaded outdoors, and the first 4 frames were impacted by light piping.  It's not like this is only going to happen with this film, but any Mylar-base film will have similar characteristics regarding light piping. So, when Mike says to keep the cassettes in black film cans and load in subdued light, you should!   The film loads fine in my Jobo reels, but it does take some care to get it started.Second thing -- I love the films that lie absolutely flat in the scanner holder, and the Derev Pan 400 (and I assume the others, as well) lies flat and is easy to scan. Third thing -- Thin Mylar-base films are notoriously hard to place in Printfile negative sheets.  Make sure you wear a rubber glove or white cotton glove so that you can gradually work the negative strip into the plastic protective sheet. Fourth thing -- I love the tonality and fine grain of this film.  I was more pleased with the results with straight D-76 at 8 minutes than the divided D-76 at 10.5.  I feel that the divided time might be closer to 12 minutes, but have yet to test it at that time. Photos! All negatives were scanned in my Epson perfection V700 scanner.roll1 roll 1roll 1roll 1roll 1roll 2roll 2roll 2roll 2roll 2I am glad that the FPP is supplying this film in 36 exposure rolls!  I can burn through a roll pretty quickly, and even though I do my own processing, it saves me time to develop fewer rolls.  I advise you to always load in subdued light indoors, if possible.  The fine-grain is excellent, and I hope to do some print making in the darkroom once I am moved to a new place.  For now, the scanning negatives works fine.  Give this film a try!!"},
{"title": "Revisiting 110 film with the Pentax Auto 110", "date": "Wednesday, April 03, 2019", "text": "My Pentax Auto 110 SLR!It's been over a decade since I have shot any 110 film.   My first 110 camera was most likely an Estes Astrocam 110, which I managed to launch enough times in the mid-1980s to get the entire roll exposed without losing the rocket or crashing it.   In this post I am also incorporating some images from my long-defunct 110 photography web pages from 2004 that used to be hosted at the University of Michigan.A shot from my Astrocam. Today it would be a drone that would get that shot. It was a thrill to get a photo from a model rocket. At one time, in the early 2000s, I had a bunch of 110 cameras that I played with,  and I especially enjoyed using the Minolta 110 Autozoom. When the supply of the film became unreliable, I sold them all off on ebay in 20009. Tiny and kinda crappy, but oh so pretty.The Ektralite series from Kodak had an electronic flashWhen it was introduced by Kodak in 1972, the 110 Instamatic was designed to be a sleek pocket camera that was basically a miniaturized 126 camera. Using 16mm film, the negatives are 13 x 17mm, with the single sprocket registration similar to the 126 cartridge design.  Because it was 16mm wide, existing equipment could be used for developing.  Kodak's 110 cameras, much like their 126 cameras are mostly small box cameras with few adjustable controls.  Many cheap plastic designs by others were on the market, and the Argus Mini-Palmatic is a good example of an inexpensive 110 camera.  The worst 110 cameras, in terms of quality are the tiny keychain cameras that basically just wrapped around a 110 cartridge.  They still turn up on eBay.  I have used them, and you could call them the \"Diana of the 110 cameras,\"  until Lomography brought out a Baby 110 Diana, that is.An assortment of 110 cameras from the cheap keychain 110 to the MinoltaAutopak 470. All sold in 2009.When Kodak introduced the Pocket Instamatic in 1972, it also released a bunch of film stocks for it - Kodachrome 64, Ektachrome X, Kodacolor II, and Verichrome Pan film. While I don't recall ever seeing any slide films in 110 (Kodak ended the Kodachrome 64 in 110 in 1982), Kodak did make a slide projector for the format (the Pocket Carousel Projector), and they turn up every now and then. Standard 35mm slide holders also had 110 format masks.  For the average snapshooter, it was color and then b&w negative film.  It is rumored that Lomography's Orca 110 b&w film is Verichrome Pan. I have no documentation for that. Fuji made 110 Superia 200 film until 2009, and that's when I sold my lot of 110 stuff.The Minolta Autozoom 110 - The Hamburger 110The excellent Minolta Autopak 450EThe Minolta Autopak 470 with its detachable flash unit. With a small negative size, it's imperative that better-quality optics are in front of the film, and for that reason, it pays to go with a more expensive 110 body.  I really enjoyed using the Minolta Autopak cameras, and the results from them are quite good.  Rollei, Canon, Pentax,and of course, Minolta made 110 cameras that very good.  I really liked using the Minolta Autozoom 110  SLR, and fitted with a close-up lens and external flash, I could achieve some pretty nice close-ups of flowers with it.  Alas, I sold all of my 110 cameras off and left the format behind.  When it was resurrected by Lomography in 2011, I just said, \"meh.\"  I left it for others to have fun with it.  I was not interested in a Diana 110.There was no problem getting great images from the Minolta 110 Autozoom SLRIn January, Mike Raso passed along a Pentax Auto 110 camera to me.  I had never owned one of them, and of course, after recent FPP podcasts on subminiature cameras, I felt it was time to revisit the format.  I always thought the Pentax Auto 110 was a lovely little SLR.  It was a complete system with different lenses, flashes, and other accessories.  While the Minolta 110 Auto-zoom was also an SLR, it was held more like a hamburger than a SLR, and is larger than the Pentax Auto 110. I was pretty excited to try it out, and after putting in fresh button cells, I loaded a Lomography Orca 100 b&w cartridge and gave the camera a try.  I had to remind myself that two strokes advance the film and cock the shutter, but it is a real, albeit tiny, SLR!The biggest and smallest Pentax film camerasThe 24mm f/2.8 lens is the \"normal\" lens for this format, and I love using it.  As a \"street camera\" it's so small and toy-like that nobody will take it as a serious camera.  It's small enough that it might be mistaken for a digicam. In fact, it's not too different in size from the Pentax Q mirrorless ILC. I had the flash on for some indoor shots, and it worked great.  On the street, I like how it fits in my hand and basically have it set it at infinity and shoot. I'm not going to go into more detail on the Pentax Auto 110, as the wikipedia page has all of the information.After I finished the roll, I had planned on developing it myself, but as I am in the process of getting our house ready to sell, I have packed away the 16mm reel in a box somewhere.  So, I sent the film to The Darkroom, and asked for enhanced scans and prints.  After all, I want to see the prints from this camera.  That all adds up, of course, and I plan on eventually doing it all myself.Results - Many of my images had odd speckles in them, and I think that's due to the paper backing letting in light.  I have put black tape over the window for the remaining frames on the current roll of Orca 110. The images were good otherwise, and most of my street shots looked great.  I am looking forward to shooting more with this little gem of a camera.So, are you ready to go out and shoot some 110 film?  A few years ago, I would have said good luck finding film for it. Now, with Lomography's 110 film offerings, and The Film Photography Project Store's new Fukkatsu B&W 100 and Fukkatsu Color 400  110 films, you can get out your 110 camera and shoot fresh film with it.  No more lurking in the eBay fringes, grabbing some long-expired Walgreens-branded 110, or some ancient Kodak Gold 100.  Now, you have more options for 110 than in 2004.Lomography 110 films:Orca 100 monochrome, standard b&w developingColor 200 - C-41 processRed Scale 200 - C-41 processColor Slide 200 - C-41 and E6 processFilm Photography Project 110 film- Just released (04/03/2018) - The FPP purchased a huge lot of the only known enigmatic Fukkatsu (in Japanese, meaning revival) film stocks!  Now available ONLY at the FPP store.Fukkatsu 100 monochrome - standard b&w processFukkatsu 400 color - C-41 processcourtesy of the FPPI plan on trying out the Fukkatsu films as soon as possible, and will report on them.  Read the FPP link above to find out more about the amazing story of the Fukkatsu film!"},
{"title": "The Nikon Pronea 6i SLR - my last tango with APS film.", "date": "Friday, March 22, 2019", "text": "I'll be honest with you.  I liked the APS format  (the official format name is IX-240) and the cameras that used the film.  Back in 2001-2004, I shot quite a bit of APS film with a couple of pocket cameras and the Minolta Vectis S-1 SLR.  I thought the varying output print formats to be very useful, and those 4 x 11\" prints in panorama mode were generally fantastic.  The only downside was the cost of processing, and also the fact that no traditional b&w films were available that could be home-processed. In fact, home-processing was out of the question for APS film.  I stopped using APS film when it became harder to find, and, as I was doing other things with my photography, APS was just a little side trip.In January, I acquired a very nice Nikon Pronea 6i APS SLR with two zoom lenses and manual; plus a couple of rolls of APS film -- all for free. First, a little about the Pronea 6iIn my opinion, the Pronea 6i was a pretty audacious camera. It was introduced in 1996, not too long before the digital onslaught.  In fact, a version of the camera was sold by Kodak as the digital DCS 315 in 1998, and updated in 1999 as the DCS-330. The DCS 330 had a 3MP sensor with a 1.9x conversion factor for lens focal length. The museum where I used to work had a DCS-330, which cost over $6000 when new. Back to the Pronea 6i that I have:First of all, the 6i features pretty much all the control that you would expect from a Nikon AF SLR.  It's most similar in features to the then contemporary N70 35mm SLR.  It features a \"Basic\" mode where it pretty much sets you up in Program mode, uses the DX code on the APS cassette.  \"Advanced\" mode gives you full control of the camera's functions and features.  If you have been using any AF SLR, the advanced mode is the way to go.Here are the key features of the Pronea 6i (from the Nikon site)Advanced Photo System Single-Lens Reflex[BASIC] and [ADVANCED] modes3D Matrix Metering features an 8-segment Matrix SensorAccepts a wide selection of AF Nikkor lenses, and IX-Nikkor lenses made especially for PRONEA seriesSimilar specs to the N70 (1994); IX240 benefits include Mag.

I will bet that when the sell-off of the Pronea cameras was going on, the kits included the 20-60 and the 60-180mm IX-Nikkors.  I used my 18-70mm AFS Nikkor G ED DX lens for about 2/3 of the roll and my 35mm f/1.8 AFS G DX lens for the remainder. Because APS cameras allow you to choose the print format, images taken in \"C\" mode will be the same as an APS-C sized sensor, so the 18mm end of the lens will not show vignetting.  In the scans, which are all at the maximum frame size, or APS-H,you can see some vignetting in the corners at 18mm. Back in the early 2000s, Bill Brudon used a Pronea S with a 14mm Nikkor lens and got great results.  WARNING - DO NOT attach those IX-Nikkor lenses to your 35mm or digital SLR - they will not allow your mirror to operate! The Pronea 6i feels great in the hand, and the contours of the camera provide a perfect grip.  The viewfinder is bright and 100% coverage, and the settings appear at the bottom of the viewfinder, just like all other Nikon AF SLRs.  The rear LCD screen, while certainly not the same as a DSLR screen, is easy to read and fairly easy to navigate once you get used to the control functions.  As with most Nikon bodies, the controls are where they should be, and while the Pronea 6i was intended to be a sort of dumbed-down SLR, users in advanced mode can control a great deal using the buttons on the back that border the LCD. There is no Depth of Field preview button. A great combo with the 18-70mm Nikkor DX lensIt's really unfortunate that the appearance of APS was not long before digital started coming out. Once that ball started rolling, the digital sales kicked APS's ass first, due in part to the many pocket cameras that were similar in size to APS.  However, here's a thought.  If you put images side-by-side from a Nikon Pronea 6i and those from the Kodak DCS 330, which were 3.0 megapixels in size... the APS image would be better by far.  It's actually too bad that Nikon didn't adopt the body shape of the Pronea 6i for its early consumer-level DSLRs.  They had the makings of a proto-digicam right there.After I finished the roll, I sent it to Thedarkroom.com and had it processed and scanned. The scans showed that the film had lost some contrast - so I bumped up the contrast in post-processing and the images looked great.  I will be shooting with it again soon.  It's a fun SLR that cam make use of some excellent Nikon glass on an orphaned film format.  I better shoot all the APS that I can before it all gets too old.the scans before adjustmentsI mentioned the Pronea S above, which while an SLR using the same lenses as the Pronea 6i, is pretty much a completely different camera with far fewer controls of the image-making.  Since I have not tried one, that's all I'll say about it, but I think S stands for Simple.I tried to find out the original list price for the Pronea 6i, and by searching back issues of Popular Photography magazines via Google Books, the best that could do was January 1999, when the Pronea 6i body was selling for about $350, and with the 20-60mm  lens, over $400. Today, you can find them on eBay for $10-$60, though some sellers are asking $249. Good luck with that.  Now for the photos!"},
{"title": "Agfa Copex Rapid 50 film - One Roll Review", "date": "Thursday, March 14, 2019", "text": "I was going through some files today and realized that although I had shot this film in 2017, and noted it in my article of the pre-assembled Caffenol mix, I did not really review the film! So, here is my recollection of the Agfa Copex Rapid 35mm film.I bought a roll of the 35mm Agfa Copex Rapid film from Freestyle to try it out. It sat in my fridge for many months before I decided to give it a try.  My delay was probably more about the development of the film than the shooting of it. At 50 ISO, it's not as slow as a lot of the strange films that I have tested, and it certainly is a stop faster than Kodak's TechPan film.  Since it's basically a microfilm, it will be inherently contrasty.  Not as much as something like Kodalith, but I assumed it was going to be more like a Technical pan type of film.Here is Freestyle's online description of this film:Agfa Copex Rapid 50 is a low-speed panchromatic black and white film with a nominal sensitivity of ISO 50/18°. Featuring excellent resolution, very fine grain and excellent acutance. The emulsion is coated on a transparent synthetic base providing excellent long-term and dimensional stability.Features:Traditional Black and White Film35mm x 36 exp.50 ISOManufactured to ISO specifications for archival useFor optimal results use: Spur Modular UR AB DeveloperNote: Film has to be loaded and unloaded in subdued light and exposed film should be stored in a light tight film container.When Copex is developed with Spur Modular UR developer, sharpness, fine-grain, exposure latitude, tonal values, speed utilization are all retained. The Parts 'A' and 'B' are needed for the absolutely streak-free development of the SPUR DSX/Agfa Copex Rapid roll film; Part 'C' is no longer needed as previously.This film can also be processed using a black and white reversal process (SCALA) to make black and white slides (positives) with a neutral black tone, a middle graduation, very fine grain, a very high sharpness and detail resolution when processed as a black and white slide.Black and White Reversal process expose to:35mm: ISO 50-64120 Medium Format: ISO 64-80Development time: 4 minutes-------------------------------------------------------------------What deterred me from shooting it for so long was the specialty developer.  I like to use what I have, and I am assuming that the aforementioned developer tames the contrast.  Nevertheless, World-wide Pinhole Day was approaching, and I wanted to shoot the film in an SLR while also doing the pinhole stuff that day.  For some reason, I chose my Minolta X-370 SLR and took it along for the day.  I shot the film at 50 ISO, and used a tripod, as it was an overcast and chilly day. Some of my exposures were set at f/16, which meant shutter speeds long enough to blur motion.  As my link at top shows, I developed the film in the Labeauratoire Caffenol Concoction  for 15 minutes.  I figured, what the hell, just go for it and see what happens!Developed in the Caffenol, the film looks a lot like some of the specialty microfilms that I have used -- though it was certainly faster.  I'll take ISO 50 over ISO 6 any day.Here are some sample images.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the results.  The film is on a PET base, so it does lie flat and scans easily. I had to do some tweaking in Corel Paint Shop Pro to get the look I wanted from the scans from the Epson V700.  I guess if I were to seriously try this film again, I would try the SPUR developer. However, the Caffenol did a pretty good job,and of course, I could also try Technidol to see how that works with the Copex rapid 50 film.The beauty of shooting film is that there are so many different approaches you can take with any particular film.  In this case, I took a chance with a non-traditional developer and it worked pretty well.  Your results may vary when using the Copex Rapid 50, but it certainly is fine-grained and may be just the solution to what you are looking for in a film.  Missing TechPan?  Give this film a try."},
{"title": "There's always something!", "date": "Monday, March 11, 2019", "text": "I recently sold a small estate of photo gear on eBay for a client.  In the midst of all this, of course, I have been getting things going on home improvements and contractors, etc.   So, I was greatly relieved when all the eBay items had sold and shipped off to the buyers.  After over a week past the sales, I did all the accounting, paid off the fees, etc., the client, and took my small percentage.  Then, over the weekend, I received an eBay message from a buyer that he was not happy with how his lens arrived.  Thankfully, he sent me photos.This is the Leitz Hektor 135mm lens with bakelite case that I shipped.It was in excellent condition as seen here, and this was the condition that it was in when it left my hands.This is the condition it was in when he received it.OUCH.In addition, the lens focusing helical was jammed up.What happened?It's my fault, pure and simple.  In my rush to get things done, I left the lens inside the Bakelite tube without adding any padding to the top end.  No matter that the entire thing was encased in bubble wrap.  There was obviously enough play inside, that when the package was in transit, all it needed was a nice flat drop on the wrong end to provide enough kinetic energy to the lens to smash the end of the Bakelite tube and ruin a perfectly good lens.  I should have known better. Bakelite is actually a very fragile material and does not resist impact very well if it has aged a long time.  It's not forgiving at all, with little resiliency.  I should have packed the lens separately from the Bakelite tube and all would have been fine.  Do you ever get those nagging little feelings that you should have done something a bit better? That was it, for me.  I knew there was some play inside, but never thought about the worst-case scenario.  I have been selling photo stuff on ebay for many years, without a problem, and this was a case of a bit of sloppiness on my part. I gave him a full refund, and thankfully, the Hektor lens was only $46. A relatively cheap lesson for me."},
{"title": "My Darkroom", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2019", "text": "I thought I would share some thoughts about my darkroom, and what I hope for in its next reincarnation, as in a few short months it will have to be packed up for wherever its next home will be.We purchased our current home in December 2002, from  Bill and Margaret Brudon.  It was a private sale, and it all came about because Bill had been a great mentor in photography to me, and we always enjoyed their home.  We moved a mile and sold the home we had purchased in 1984 and in the span of a few days, closed on two home transactions, cleaned the old house, and moved into our current home, which, because it did not go on the open market, was much like moving into your parent's old house.  My wife and I did a lot of cleaning and decluttering, and we never missed our old home once.  This house is a mid-century home with real plaster walls, cove ceiling in the living and dining rooms, red oak flooring (which is just now being refinished this week).  It also came with a 5x7 darkroom in the basement, fully furnished, since Bill was leaving that behind.  This darkroom allowed me to explore b&w photography as much as I wished, and I have spent many hours there developing film, listening to music, or more recently, The Film Photography Podcast, and WCBN FM, a public radio station at UM that plays an amazing variety of music.I have not printed a single b&w photo in the past 3 years, and I miss doing that.  I used to print a lot, and got fairly good results, but now I only print if I am doing a show.  That  seems a bit stupid in hindsight, but I really didn't want to be inundated with prints without a purpose.  I hope to change that in the coming years, and wherever our new home will be, it will have to have space for my new expanded darkroom.   I am torn as to take the darkroom sink with me, or leave it.  It's perfect for the space that it is now.  I'll have to wait and see how I feel as a real move approaches.  The walls on one side are paneling, and as you can see, cassette wrappers are stuck to it.  The other sides are masonite peg board, which had been painted black by Bill.  My new space will have no black walls.  This is a comfortable one-person darkroom. Put two people in there, and it's awfully close.  I want to be able to do film photography workshops in the future, so more space would be desirable.This darkroom has performed well for two different photographers, and I very much doubt the next owner of the house will want it used.  Maybe it will make a good space for something other than photography, but I suppose it will get torn out someday.    A lot of \"me time\" has been spent there, developing, thinking, and isolated from whatever is going on outside in the world.   Those of you that have a darkroom will know what I mean.   It's not so much that one is isolated, but free from distraction to print and to ponder, to develop that next roll of film and still feel the magic that is inherent in the process, and to think about new projects and continuing old ones.So, sometime in the next few months, I will be boxing all of the stuff up to take to a new adventure.  I have already divested myself of materials and equipment that I don't need or use, and while there will still be some junk to be tossed, everything else goes to NC with us."},

Things I am not necessarily needing to access until we are settled.  While boxing some items,  I found a bunch of CD's with photos on them, and yes, they are all labelled with the pertinent information.  I pulled one out, and it was from The Darkroom, and it contains scans from a September 2014 road trip that Marc Akemann and I took to Monroe, MI and places around it, including Luna Pier.  All of the following were taken with a Konica FS-1 that I had, and I have no idea when I sold it or gave it away, but I think I divested myself of all Konica stuff in 2015.  All these images were on Hawkeye Surveillance Film, a nice C-41 color film from Kodak.  I wish that I had bought about 4 100 ft. rolls when I had the chance! Some of these have been cropped from the 35mm frame to square format. As I recall, I liked the FS-1.  It was the first 35mm SLR to have a built-in motor drive in 1979.  It had a weakness with the battery holder, though, and that was a sore point with an otherwise nice camera.  It's fun finding some things that I have not looked at for a while, but I better keep packing, as the contractors are coming Monday to refinish all the wood floors!  I'll see you again in a month or so!Mark"},
{"title": "Shooting with a Leica IIIa - One roll review", "date": "Friday, February 15, 2019", "text": "Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of the Barnack Leicas (all models that predate the M series) for glasses wearers.  In my humble opinion, the viewfinders are not a whole lot better than that of an Argus C3.  I feel quite differently about the M series.  This particular Leica IIIa came my way as part of an estate to auction off.  I try to test cameras as much as possible before selling them, and sometimes that includes running a roll of film through them.  Now, onto the camera...This Leica IIIa was made in 1937, according to its serial number and online data records.  So, here is a 35mm camera that's over 80 years old, looking pretty much like it was made yesterday.  That's not going to be the case with most cameras, including Leicas.  However, it's jewel-like appearance invited me to take it out and test it.  I suppose the ever-ready leather case kept it looking so good all these years.  It's as if a time machine dropped the camera into my lap. Okay, it looks great, but how does it work?  One of the pitfalls of using the Barnack Leicas (and the Ukraine-Russian copies) is that you must trim the film leader to the right shape so that when you blind load the film from the bottom, it does not bind up with the gears.  Once you have that accomplished, you are ready to shoot.  It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it.The weather has not been conducive to going out and testing a camera such as this, but finally I had an opportunity to do so last week.  I loaded up an expired roll of Plus-X pan and used my \"sunny-16\" mojo for estimating the exposures.  One nice feature of the IIIa is that you can set the rangefinder viewer to infinity for quicker street shooting. In full afternoon sun, making an exposure is pretty simple. I won't get into the differences between the different Leica models, as I am not a Leica historian, and you can look it up elsewhere.  However, the operational differences between the IIIa and a more recent IIIf are not many, the main differences being flash synchronization and a self-timer on the IIIf.  Both have a front slow shutter speed dial for speeds below 1/20 second.  It wasn't until the modern Leicas - the M series that all the shutter speeds from B- 1/1000 were on one dial.I have to say, the Barnack Leicas are simply wonderful pieces of craftsmanship and are relatively easy to use. They are very compact, use no batteries, and with a lens such as the collapsible Elmar f/3.5 lens, can easily be carried in a coat pocket or a small pouch. You have to make sure that the collapsible lens is fully extended before shooting. So long as you can be comfortable with the tiny viewfinders they are really worth investigating if you want to shoot with a Leica.  The prices are far lower than the M-series, except for rare models or those of historical importance.The Leica IIIa performed well, and I did get some decent images from it. The expired Plus-X Pan was very curly and cupped after developing and drying, and I had to weigh the sheet of negatives down for a few days to get them flat enough to scan properly. I wish I had used a roll of Iflord FP4 or Ultrafine Xtreme 400 instead!I was able to test the camera thoroughly, and it's now up on eBay.  I hope that whoever buys it takes it out to shoot and does not let it just sit in a display case.  These cameras are wonderful tools, and should be used!"},
{"title": "Street Candy ATM 400 - One Roll Review", "date": "Sunday, February 10, 2019", "text": "There has certainly been an explosion of boutique-branded 35mm films of late.  Some of them are new emulsions, such as the Ferrania P30 and the Bergger Pancro 400 b&w films. Others, such as Kosmo Foto Mono 100, Lomography’s Berlin Kino and Lady Grey films are merely repackaged and relabeled films from the OFM (Original Film Manufacturer) that are standard well-known film stocks.  On the other hand, we have the JCH Street Pan, and now the Street Candy ATM 400 films that are non-standard emulsions from OFMs that were designed for other purposes but have found their way into our 35mm still cameras due to the enthusiasm and diligence of the people that brought them to market.  Add to that list the new films from the Film Photography Project under the Derev Pan label.  Mike Raso gave me a roll of the Street Candy ATM film to test, and finally, after over a month of delay, I have finished the roll and developed it.  Of course, you can buy this film at the FPP Store!What is it?  Vincent Moschetti  introduced this film  in 2018, and the original use for it was in surveillance cameras in ATM machines.  Because of that, the OFM produced the emulsion on a thin polyester base so that more film could be loaded into a reel  for the ATM cameras. I did not test this earlier version of Street Candy, but I suspect that it was similar in handling to some of the thin base films from Svema.  The Street Candy ATM 400 that I tested is on a thicker polyester base, and is easy to handle.  Vincent makes the case that the Street Candy ATM 400 gives a \"gritty\" look to street scenes, and yet delivers a good range of tonality.  The data sheet for the film gives some standard processing times, and he recommends that the developers and times for Ilford’s HP-5+ can be applied to the Street Candy ATM 400 film.  So, as to the identity of the OFM, maybe it’s Ilford?  In any case, it’s good to see an emulsion that does not require me to test for the best developer/time combination to get usable results or require some strange developer that I don’t normally use.    I love the 80s-look of the branding, and Street Candy implies some slightly illicit activity.My resultsI originally loaded the roll into my Nikon FA when I was in NJ for the FPP recording sessions.  I shot about a dozen frames in NJ, and about a month later I took the FA out to shoot, and when I went to take some photos I realized that the batteries had died.  I shot a couple of frames using the manual 1/250 sec and came home.  I decided not to trust the FA in cold weather, so I rewound the roll and loaded it into my very trust-worthy Nikon FM.  Therefore, the remainder of the roll was shot yesterday in downtown Ann Arbor.I developed the Street Candy ATM 400 in D76 1:1 at 20C for 11 minutes.  Standard agitation, and a water rinse to stop, and then 8 minutes in fixer, followed by a 1 minute water rinse, archival wash, another 1 minute rinse, then a final soak in distilled water with Photoflo to avoid spots from the Ann Arbor water.  I hung the film to dry overnight and scanned it this morning.The film has a slight cupping to it, and does not lie perfectly flat like I would have expected.  Once I cut the film into strips to fit the scanner holder, the remaining film still hanging curled up like a spring.  That too, was unexpected.  So, perhaps I am wrong about the backing being polyester. The film scanned fine, and I did not have to tweak the scans to achieve a proper \"look\".  I am presenting the scans here without any post-processing other than to remove dust spots and stray cat hairs (!!!!).I find the overall results to be quite satisfactory, and the film’s grain is not detrimental to the images, and is in fact, very nice. I shot the film under a variety of conditions,  and I certainly find it to be better for me than the results that I got with JCH Street Pan.  It’s a bit different of a look than I get with my go-to film Ultrafine Xtreme 400, but not too punchy.  If you are looking to try something different, I think you’ll like Street Candy ATM 400.  For me, I’ll stick with a film that I already know and love, and that would be either Ilford HP-5+ or Ultrafine Xtreme 400.   The slight cupping and spiraling of the film after it dried was unexpected, and is a minus for me.  I like my film to lie perfectly flat, and that's what I get from my favorite films.  Still, after all is said and done, the Street Candy ATM 400 is worth a try, and you may like the look that it gives to your images."},
{"title": "Some Iced Coffee... my last rolls of Mr. Brown", "date": "Thursday, January 31, 2019", "text": "A few years ago, I did a one-roll review of the Mr. Brown film from the Film Photography Project Store.  Over the past month, I have managed to shoot my last two rolls.  The first roll was shot at ISO 6, and developed in my caffenol recipe for 15 minutes at 20°C.  It was quickly apparent to me that the negatives were overdeveloped, as they were quite dense.  Well, one fix for that was to try the second, and last roll at a higher ISO and cut a smidge off the development time in caffenol.  Since Mr. Brown is now out of stock, you may wonder why I am publishing this now.  Well, I imagine that there are some users that have yet to shoot all that they purchased and have some rolls left.  Also, film photography is also about experimenting and sharing results, so here we go.First of all, here is the Caffenol recipe that I use:450 ml water27 grams Sodium Carbonate8 grams Ascorbic Acid20 grams Instant coffee5 grams Iodized saltMix in 30°C water and let cool to 20°C before using.  Development times can be from 10-15 minutes, depending on film, so experiment to see what works for you.Roll 1: Mr. Brown at ISO 6, shot with Nikon N80, 15 min development time. The negatives were very dense, so I had to adjust the curves in the scans to get a normal-looking image: You can tell that the highlights are blown out.  So, after that, I decided that in Caffenol, Mr. Brown could be rated at ISO 12-25, perhaps even higher. Roll 2.  Shot in my Nikon F2S, 105mm Nikkor, I rated the film at ISO 25.  Quite different subject, with the high contrast ice and dark water, but I also figured that I would develop it for 1 minute less in the caffenol, for 14 minutes.  I still had to do some adjustments in the scans, but still very good for this type of subject, which is about as contrasty as I could get. These are all along Mill Creek in Dexter, MI.Overall, very good.  So, this tells me that Mr. Brown is certainly a film worth trying in Caffenol, with the added benefit of being able to shoot at a higher ISO than 6!   Of course, you may want to also try this recipe with other low-ISO films to see what you get.  I'd be happy to hear about your results."},
{"title": "Review of Kodak's NEW Ektachrome E100", "date": "Wednesday, January 23, 2019", "text": "Last October, I received my five 35mm rolls of the new E100 Ektachrome that I had ordered from the FPP store.  Of course, I was elated to see Kodak Alaris finally ship their product after what seemed to be a long wait (not anywhere as long as Film Ferrania!).  Considering that this new E-6 film had some hurdles to overcome in the digital hegemony, I am pleased that Kodak Alaris took a chance on bringing it forth.  I have been shooting slide film since the mid-1970s, and while I don't shoot it as often as I did over a decade ago, I still find it relevant to my photography. Since Kodak pulled out of the E-6 market in 2012, we have been left with only one E-6 emulsion manufacturer -- Fujifilm.  I'll admit that I have been shooting fresh Provia and some fresh and expired Velvia in the last few years, and there is nothing wrong with either film.  However, given Fujifilm's penchant for dropping well-liked film stocks, who knows how long before they are gone?As a long-time user of film from Eastman Kodak, I loved Ektachrome, and its varied emulsions.  For me, an ISO 100 slide film was my mainstay when shooting nature and macro.  While faster emulsions were available, I used them far less often.  Kodachrome 64 was a superb film, too, though I shot it less often than E-6 film.  Since Kodak had withdrawn form making ANY slide films, I was using old stock that had been refrigerated.  The problem there, of course, is that as films age, the results will not be optimal.  So, I was pretty excited when Kodak Alaris announced in early 2017 that it was bringing a new Ektachrome into the world.  I didn't expect it to take over a year before it was available, but it has been worth the wait.So far, I have shot two rolls of the new E100, and both were developed by The Darkroom in San Clemente, CA.  While I have an E-6 kit at home, I did not want my results tainted by personal goof-ups.  One roll was shot in my trusty Nikon N80 in Aperture-priority mode, and the other in my also trusty, full- manual Nikon FM.  I got the film back uncut, and cut it into 5-frame lengths to fit my archival print file pages.  I am not putting the film into slide mounts because it's easier scanning in strips.  I can mount it in mounts later, should I want to.  The film was scanned on my Epson V700 photo scanne at 2400 dpi. As an experienced E-6 shooter, I trusted my instincts when shooting with this film, compensating for the lighting conditions when it was appropriate.  A polarizer was used in some instances.  I am very pleased with my results, and the E100 film is everything that I had hoped for.N80, Mackinac Island, MIN80, Mackinac Island, MIN80, Mackinac Island, MIN80, Whitefish Point, MIN80, Mackinac Island, MIN80, Tacquahmenon Falls, MINikon FM, Looking Glass Creek, NCNikon FM, Bat Cave, NCNikon FM,  NCNikon FM, Bat Cave, NC Nikon FM, Chimney Rock, NCNikon FM, Chimney Rock, NC"},
{"title": "The Canon T60 SLR -   A sweet shooter!", "date": "Thursday, January 17, 2019", "text": "Last month, a friend gave me this Canon T60 that she picked up at an estate sale for $10.  I promised her that I would shoot with it.  The Canon T60 was the very last FD-mount SLR that Canon sold.  Note the emphasis on sold.  Canon didn't make it, but Cosina did.  Like a bunch of other manual cameras produced at the end of the reign of manual SLRs, The Canon T60, Nikon FM10, Olympus OM 2000, Yashica FX-7, and Konica TCX, were all made by Cosina.  Whatever is on the outside, it's Cosina inside.  Not that it is necessarily a bad thing, as you'll see.The Canon T60 appeared in 1990, well after the Canon EOS series had been introduced.  There was enough demand for cheaper alternatives using the FD-mount, that Canon contracted the camera's production with Chinon, and in the process, ended up with a traditional-looking sleek SLR that was certainly quite different from all the other FD-mount cameras, as well as the rest of the T-series.The GOODThe T60 is a lovely, all-plastic camera. It is lightweight, and coupled with a standard 50mm f/1.8 FD lens, makes for a sweet carry-around SLR. Unlike most Canon FD-mount cameras, it has a vertical Copal Square shutter, APERTURE-priority and manual control, and requires 2 LR-44 cells to operate.  The vertical metal-bladed shutter keeps it in line with the rest of the T series cameras - T50, T70, and T90.  Unlike the other T-series cameras, it has manual film advance.  Again, this is a Cosina camera, not a Canon! The controls are easy to use, and the camera has a nice feel in the hands.  The viewfinder is pretty good, and the shutter speeds show on the left side of the viewfinder. Focus is with a split-image center spot, surrounded by a microprism collar.ParticularsISO settings: 25-1600Shutter speeds: B, A mode, 1-1/1000 sec.

No PC socket. The sync speed is 1/60 sec.Shutter release: ability to use screw in cable release.Lens Mount - Canon FD and FL(?), metal lens mount.The BADBasically, it's the plastic body.  I am sure if handled properly and not abused, the T60 will be just fine. If the 2 cells lose power, there is no manual mode on the camera, so it's dead until you put in fresh LR-44s. It would make a great \"student camera\" and certainly does not suffer from the AE-1 squeak and issues with older FD-mount cameras.  As an A-mode camera, I would love it if it had a +/- compensation dial. But face it, this camera was designed for a particular price point, and in that, it succeeds.RESULTSThe feel of this camera reminded me of the Yashica FX-7 Super, which I really liked.  Its light weight and precise feel of operation really made it a fun camera.  I shot with a Sunpak Auto 311 flash and had great results.  After putting 4 rolls of film through it, I cannot find any fault with the exposures in A mode, or the flash photos at 1/60 sec.  I shot it with Ilford HP-5+, and here are a bunch of examples, including some with the FPP gang in NJ.grain silo and ladder, Chelsea, MIBBQ, Chelsea, MIAlley in Chelsea, MIMike Raso with Canon Sure-shot MaxBMW dealership, Wayne, NJObscura Darkroom, NJTick-Tock Diner, NJMat ponders the 4x5Start them young!  Obscura Darkroom Opening, NJBuying one?  This is a more recent camera than any other FD-mount Canon. The FD series of lenses are quite affordable, and typically good quality. The only factor might be the mirrorless uses that could drive up the prices on some of the lenses.  Put a 50 mm lens on it and be done.  The T60 cameras on ebay are usually in the $25-$60 range, depending on lenses, etc.  It's certainly a more ergonomic camera than the T50 and T70 cameras, and not a beast like the T90.  Its sleek, all-black finish will charm you into buying one.  Make sure that you get one that has not been mistreated."},
{"title": "The Fujica STX-1 SLR", "date": "Thursday, January 03, 2019", "text": "Of all the different cameras that I have handled over the years, I confess that I have not shot with many SLR cameras made by Fuji Photo Film.  In 2007, I briefly shot with a  Fujica ST 801, which is an M42-mount SLR with some nice features. That camera was part of an estate sale that was eventually sold, and I put one roll of film through it.  Last fall, I was going through donations of cameras for the Film Photography Project, and opened a box with a Fujica STX-1 camera and two lenses. We could not get the camera to work, so I brought it home to see if I could get it working.  I opened the bottom plate and saw that a cam was not engaging. I slipped it back into place, and now the camera works just fine!  That gave me the opportunity to shoot with the camera for a bit before it goes back into the FPP School Donation Program.Evolution of the Fuji SLRsFuji Photo Film started producing SLR cameras in 1962 with their Fujicarex leaf-shutter SLR, which was followed by the Fujicarex II in 1963.  They were innovative, with the controls for the exposure and focus made via thumbwheels on the back plate.  The cameras had other quirks, and like most leaf-shutter SLRs from the 1960s, they were limited in lenses, shutter speed, and were left behind by the focal-plane shutter SLRs.  Today, they are somewhat rare, and probably rarely work well.In the days when many SLR camera manufacturers that were not Nikon, Canon, Topcon, Miranda, Minolta, or Olympus, the M42 mount (or Praktica screw mount, or Pentax Screw Mount, or just M42) was the “other” mount.  Fuji came out with their series of ST models which used the M42 mount.  The ST701 appeared in 1971, followed by the ST 801 in 1973.  The ST 901 appeared in 1974, and featured Aperture-Priority exposure.  The ST 605 appeared in 1976, and the ST 705 came out in 1977. All of these models have cloth horizontal shutters, are well-made, and use match-needle metering visible in the finder.  The exception is the ST 801, which was the first SLR to use diodes in the finder instead of a match-needle and scale.   The Fujica AZ-1 was their last M42-mount camera, which featured Aperture-Priority, TTL auto-exposure, and was the first SLR to be sold with a zoom lens (43-75mm) as the kit lens.  Nearing the end of the 70s, the demand for more features such as full-aperture metering and easier lens mounting,  led to the abandonment by Fuji of the M42 mount and the adoption of a new mount, the Fuji X-mount (not to be confused with the x-mount of the current Fuji digital mirrorless cameras).  Fuji introduced their new system with the STX-1 in 1979.  There were a limited number of x-mount lenses available, and the STX-1 came with a 55mm f/2.2 X-Fujinon lens.  The odd thing is that the shutter speeds go from B, to ½- 1/700th sec.  Again, a cloth focal plane shutter.  Match-needle metering, visible in the viewfinder.  There is a depth of field preview button above the self-timer arm.  The camera is fully manual, and the flash sync speed is 1/60th sec.  There is a locking collar around the shutter release, preventing inadvertent releases.  The camera has a clean design – I would say that while it is not a “spectacular” SLR, it does what it does well.  The meter is engaged when you press halfway-down on the shutter, and the match needle is easy to see on the right side of the viewfinder.  On the left side of the viewfinder you can see the shutter speeds.  I like the meter markings, which are handy in adjusting the exposure.  As a full-manual camera, it is pretty much perfect.  The film advance lever is well-designed and comfortable to use.   The camera requires 2 S-76  or SR-44 cells to power the meter. The only oddball thing is that the tripod socket is not centered on the camera, and is to the left.   The camera was received with the 55mm f2.2 lens and a 28mm f/2.8 Fujinon-x lens.Clean design and controlsThrough the viewfinderThe X-mount continued with the AX series, which started with the AX-1 in 1980, followed by the AX-3 and AX-5.  These cameras all have more automation and features than the STX-1. The STX-2  was introduced in 1985, and the AX-5 Multi-Program appeared in 1985, and they were the last of the 35mm SLRs made with the Fuji X-mount.  The STX-2 was sold as the Fuji STX-2, and not Fujica.Fuji Photo Film Co. has produced some amazing cameras over the years, especially in the medium format area.  While first and foremost a film producer, they did produce some very fine lenses and cameras.  I can understand why they stopped producing 35mm SLRs in the mid-1980s.  The market was dominated by Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Minolta and Olympus.  While the Fujica SLRs were reliable, sturdy, and certainly had the typical features that one needed, I suspect that Fuji felt they could produce  cameras where there was less competition – and so we had some excellent medium format cameras and lenses.  In using the STX-1, I found the camera to handle very well, but certainly not much different than any other compact SLRs from the early 1980s.   The 1/700th sec shutter speed is odd, and that was   rectified by the STX-2 with a max shutter speed of 1/1000 sec.  Had Fuji adopted the Copal Square vertical shutter rather than the horizontal cloth shutter, they might have had a longer run with 35mm, but by the mid-1980s, it was pretty much Nikon, Pentax, Canon, or Minolta for people looking to buy a 35mm SLR as a system camera.You could do far worse than the Fujica 35mm SLRs.  If you are looking for an inexpensive manual 35mm SLR, the ST 801 or the STX-1 are certainly worthwhile purchases.  The X-mount lenses were only produced for about 6 years, so there are fewer of them out there.   The advantage of the ST 801 might be the plethora of M42-mount lenses that are available.   One review makes the case for the ST 801 as the best M-42 mount SLR available. I have to agree, based upon what I have seen over the years.You should be able to find an STX-1 on ebay for less than $50.Here are a few samples taken with the STX-1 on Ultrafine Xtreme 400 film.A few more examples from Kodak T400 CN film (expired) (added 06/27/19)."},

Johan, my furrybuddy, seems to think that is the best place to be.  It makes typinga bit awkward, but he's not been feeling well the past few days, soI'll put up with it. Eventually, he moves around behind me on the seat, which probably helps my sitting posture.Last year seems likeonly yesterday, and it was quite a year. My first year of retirementwas filled with lots of travel, lots of photography, and personally,was quite good.  I still think about my friend Marc, and wish I couldshare some of my adventures with him.  I think my film photographywas extremely prolific, with at least 120 rolls shot.  Betweentesting new films, old cameras, and travel, I was also doing a lot offilm developing.  Of course, I scan my negatives, and while I have mydarkroom and enlarger, I rarely print just for the sake of printing. I only make prints if I have a project in mind.  Film photography isgaining more press and more traction, and I think most of would agreethat the variety of film stocks  (especially in b&w) keepsincreasing.  I hope that 2019 sees some great new products on themarket.Speaking ofdarkrooms… my most important acquisition has been the sous videheater for doing C-41, ECN-2,  and E-6 developing.  It's been anincredible water and time saver, not to mention, giving me greatuniformity in my developing process.  While I bought mine on Amazonfor about $70, The FPP is selling one for about $50.   Of course, ifyou are doing stand development in regular b&w chemistry, theunit is even more desirable, especially if your workspace is chilly. This year will seesome big changes in my life, as we are preparing to sell our home andmove to the Asheville, NC area.  As we look at houses, it will beimportant for me to have darkroom and studio space.   Analogphotography processes will be an important aspect of my life, and Iwill continue to be advocating for traditional processes.  We willhave lived in Michigan for 38 years this May, and while we havegreatly enjoyed Michigan, Adrienne and I are looking forward to newadventures elsewhere.  She retired from her job yesterday, and nowboth of us are “pensioners.”   We both grew up in New York State,and miss the terrain, but not the long winters, so the Appalachiansare calling to us, and Asheville is a good fit.  We probably won't bemoving until mid-year, and in the interim, I have lots to do. Due to the impendingmove I'll probably be selling some of my camera gear on eBay that Iam not using.  Just look for argusmaniac on eBay, and you can see myauctions. Moving a household is filled with making decisions on whatto move.

{"title": "Minolta Hi-Matic AF2 - Review", "date": "Friday, December 14, 2018", "text": "It’s interesting how one changes an opinion about a camera over time.  What was once considered a modest point and shoot camera that was neither full-featured nor extremely compact, now is a desirable camera that has a good lens, and is possibly a “sleeper” in terms of being a street photography camera.  Such is the case with the Minolta Hi-Matic AF2!  I had one of these cameras come my way over 20 years ago, and did not think much of it.  It certainly was not as good as my SLR, and I wanted a camera that would allow me to have CONTROL over what I was doing.  Point and Shoot was not what I was looking for at the time. Now, it’s 2018, and cameras like the Minolta Hi-Matic AF2 are in demand by people that want a camera that fits the street photography ethos - not threatening, no flash unless you really need it, and relatively quiet.  A good lens is a bonus.  No DX coding, so that you can use weird films, and your home-rolled stuff.  The ability to use a filter, and a not-quite-wide but not-really-normal lens that gives you a bit wider view.  No motor drive to make noise.  Easy to hold in the hand.That pretty much describes the Minolta Hi-Matic AF2. This Minolta AF2 came my way as a “not quite working” donation to the FPP's school donation project.   Any cameras that we send to the schools have to be fully operational, anything otherwise becomes a problem for someone learning photography.  For those of us experienced folks, we can find work-arounds, but that doesn’t mean that a 7th-grader can do so.  After some fiddling with this camera, I decided to bring it home and see what I could do with it.  It turns out that the camera works fine, except -- the pop-up flash is dead.  Maybe it’s nothing more than a corroded wire somewhere, but I am not going to tear the camera open to find out.  The 2 AA batteries power the camera just fine, and all other functions work. It just cannot be used in flash mode, so most indoor or evening photography is out.clean layout on topin case you forget how it worksCamera SpecificationsRelease date - 1981Original price - suggested retail was $248 according to May 1981 Popular Photography.Shutter Speeds - ⅛ to 1/430 second, auto-programmed by the camera with the appropriate aperture according to the ISO setting.Aperture - f/2.8 - f/17Flash sync speed - 1/40 secLens - 38mm f/2.8 - 4 elements in 3 groups, filter ring diameter is 46mmExposure - determined by a CdS sensor next to the lens, with range of EV 6 to EV 17ISO range - 25-400Focus - Auto-focus, 1 meter to infinity, parallax-correction in viewfinder, red LED in viewfinder to indicate focus.  Pre-set AF by pressing shutter button halfway.Power - 2 AA cellsSelf-timer and tripod socket includedSize - 2 ⅛ x 3 x 5 1/16 inches, weight 14 ounces with batteries.Impressions and ResultsOverall, fairly average specifications, and nothing that stands out as unique.  It’s not too dissimilar in specifications from the Canon AF 35M (1979)  or the Nikon L35 AF (1983) that came out before and after the AF2.  However, one thing that I find attractive about the camera is the lever-wind film advance, and not a motorized drive that eats up batteries, let alone the noise that they make.   The camera is certainly not compact, but it isn’t fiddly, either.  The AF is based on infrared, meaning that it may have a problem properly focusing on really bright objects in a scene.  Since the AF is center-based, you’ll need to pre-focus if your subjects are off to one side if the background is at infinity.  Easily done if you press the shutter button halfway and you see the red LED indicating focus.  Then, recompose and press the shutter all the way.After I was sure that the camera was pretty much working, I loaded a roll of Ultrafine Xtreme 400 to give it the test.  I walked around town for an hour and shot the roll.  The next day I processed the film in Rodinal at 1:25 for 7.5 minutes.  The negatives were scanned on my Epson V700 Photo scanner.Overall, I am happy with the results.  There were a few times that I felt the camera was having difficulty achieving proper focus, which may have had something to do with the bright sun that was at a low angle in the December sky.  The camera is certainly easy to use, and while the flash did not work, it was not a hindrance shooting in the day.  Of course, with ISO 400 film, you can shoot indoors at 1/8 sec at f/2.8, so have a tripod handy. I have put a roll of color film in it, and will see how that does in the near future.PricesHow much?  Although the 1981 list price was nearly $250, I am pretty sure the camera sold well below that, especially after the revised AF2-M version came out in 1982 with a motorized film advance, which brought it more in line with Canon and then Nikon's AF point and shoots.  Today, prices are all over the place.  I'll bet you can find one in a thrift store for less than $10, but on eBay, prices seem to be climbing over $50 for one that is tested and working perfectly."},
{"title": "One Roll Review - Kodak Vision3  50D film", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2018", "text": "image courtesy of the FPP If you have been following the Film Photography Project or Cinestill, you have undoubtedly heard about the Eastman Kodak Vision films. The Vision3  films are ECN-2 process color negative films designed for movie-making.  Each film is designed for a particular need, and there are daylight (D) and tungsten (T) versions to impart the proper color palette and balance for the movie filming.  As they are designed to be used in cine cameras, the film has a remjet layer on the base side, to allow lubrication of the film in the movie cameras.  Remjet is a layer of mostly fine carbon.  ECN-2 process removes the remjet layer in the processing sequence.   There are subtle differences between ECN-2 and C-41 processes, and if you wish to process the Vision films you can do it yourself in a C-41 kit.  What you can’t do is send the film to a lab that does not do ECN-2.  Don’t try and trick your local lab, either. You will be persona non-grata when they realize that your roll of film contaminated their chemistry.  When you develop it yourself the best way to remove the remjet is before the processing steps, not after.  I use water at the same temp as the developer - 39°C.  I dissolve 1 tsp of Sodium bicarbonate in 500ml of water and presoak the film in it -- shaking it vigorously like a cocktail shaker.  Shake for 30 seconds, stopping to burp the gas released from the tank.  Pour out the water - it will be gray with the dislodged carbon from the remjet layer. Refill with water at the same temp and shake vigorously for 10 sec and pour out the water. Repeat until the water looks clear.  Then, continue with the C-41 processing. After the stabilizer step at the end, wipe the base side with a microfiber cloth to remove any remaining remjet.  You can elect to remove the remjet after processing, but you'll end up with more carbon in your chemistry than doing it beforehand.Who sells it?Cinestill has already treated their films to remove the remjet before you shoot them.  Of course, that figures into the price of their film.  The Film Photography Project Store  sells the Vision Films just as they are (in 24 exposure rolls), without any remjet removal.  That brings the price down, but you will have to send your film to an ECN-2  lab like Blue Moon Camera or do it yourself.A while back, I picked up some Vision 50D from the FPP, and finally finished the roll in my Yashica FX-7 Super back in October.My ResultsKodak’s Vision3 50D film is daylight-balanced for 5500K sunlight.  It’s a rather slow film at ISO 50, but the consequence of that is that it is practically grainless!  It’s a wonderful film that renders colors - especially the greens, in a very true to life manner.   I have used other Vision3 films - 100T, 500T, and 250D.  Of all of these, I like the results from the 50D the best.   There is a Flickr group for the Vision3 films.If you look carefully at the images below, you can see some lines and markings where I didn't get all of the carbon removed before I scanned the negatives.  That can be remedied by using one the Pec film cleaning pads. Remember to only treat the base side, not the emulsion!shade, at Knight's Restaurantmorning sun on chairs, Jones MansionMural in Holly, MIHolly, MIHolly, MIBev, in shadeAdrienne, in shadesunlit interior, Jones Mansion FPP meetup, Augustwindow light, Holly, MIHolly, MII asked Mike Raso about how the 50D fares in comparison to the other Vision films at the FPP store, and he said that the 50D doesn't get any love, as everyone seems to want the 500T.  Well, I love this film.   The Vision3 50D is a fantastic, nearly grainless color negative film with lovely color rendition."},

For some reason, I had not realized that Google had changed some settings that I did not fully understand.  This morning I saw that there were about 60 comments that I had not seen because the notification was not sent for them to be moderated.  I have fixed that, and sent away the spammers, and posted the real comments.  I am touched by the responses to my tribute to Marc Akemann.  I know that he influenced many people during his life, and he was always helpful to anyone that asked.  I still think of him regularly, and grief has given way to acknowledging that he would want us all to be happy with our lives, and to be good people.I appreciate the comments on film and camera reviews -- I will try and answer those as much as I can, when I can.  Old cameras come our way, usually without a history attached to them.  If a camera isn't working properly, it may be why it was sold in the first place.  For others, it can sometimes be a simple fix, and others... a quagmire of possibilities and sometimes there is no fix.  My basic rule is, do no harm, and don't force anything.  But sometimes a quick bang on the bottom of the camera against my desktop can do wonders.  I am not a camera tinkerer, and certainly do not consider myself a repair person.  I have gotten bolder lately, as more people post fix-it solutions on the web. For film reviews, I am not doing extensive tests, but shooting/developing the film as I normally might.  A one-roll review is like that.  For films that I shoot a lot with, I use them because they satisfy my concepts of what I am looking for, whatever that may be.   They must also be easy to process.  If I have to resort to buying some special developer to get the optimum results, then it's pretty unlikely that I will use that film.  My usual developers are HC-110, D-76, Rodinal, XTOL, and Caffenol when I am so inclined.  For C-41 I use the FPP C-41 kit, and E-6 I usually send to The Darkroom because I don't shoot enough of it to fully utilize the E-6 kit. I am glad that you enjoy Random Camera Blog, and please keep the comments coming.  I'll reply to the backlog of your comments as soon as I can.

{"title": "The UniveX Minute-16 camera", "date": "Wednesday, December 05, 2018", "text": "Yesterday's visit to a local thrift store resulted in an interesting find and a purchase.  I spied a plastic bag with a blue box among a pile of cameras in a case at Treasure Mart.   Curious, I asked the clerk to retrieve it so that I could take a look.  The little box contained a minty Universal Minute-16 camera with all the documentation.  The price was $18!  Normally, I might have passed it over, but after seeing Mark Dalzell’s Tynar 16mm (discussed in FPP Episode 190), I figured it was worth a look.What is the Minute-16?  Although it looks remarkably like a tiny movie camera, the Universal Minute-16 is actually a still camera that uses 16mm film in special cassettes to produce 11 x 14mm negatives.  Yes, a “spy camera”, which was a popular post-WWII niche camera.  While many people know of the German Minox spy camera, and the Mamiya -16 and Minolta-16, which are quality sub-mini cameras from Japan, the Minute-16 is not well-known, and certainly not up the the standards or complexity of the imported cameras.  Before I go on, let me say a few things about Universal Camera.A Brief  History of Universal CameraMy brief history is extracted from my reading of the excellent book, The Univex Story by Cynthia A. Repinski.  ISBN # 0-931838-17-7, published in 1991 by Centennial Photo Service, 272 pp.Universal Camera was started in 1932 in NYC, and was immediately successful with their first camera, the Univex  Model A.  Imagine trying to start up a camera company during the Depression!  The Univex Model A was a plastic-bodied tiny box camera that used a size 00 film made by Gevaert to produce 6 images of 1 ½ x 1 ⅛” per roll.  Certainly not an outstanding camera, but at 39 cents, Universal sold millions of them - 15 million, in fact.  The film spools had a v-shaped notch that meant Univex only supplied the film.  Sort of like the razor model of retailing.  While the Model A cameras were simple, the negative was large enough to produce acceptable prints, and at that price, it was the first camera for many young people.UniveX Model AAfter the Univex Model A, Universal designed and sold several different cameras that were more advanced than the Model A, as well as an 8mm movie camera and projector that were priced well below other manufacturers’ offerings.  In 1938, They released the UniveX Mercury Model CC camera.  The camera vaguely resembles a parking meter, and pre- WWII models used a proprietary Univex film load.   Post-war Mercury II cameras used 35mm and produced half-frame images.  From 1938-941, Universal produced a bunch of “candid” cameras, such as the UniveX Iris, UniveX Zenith, UniveX Corsair, and more cine cameras.The war years were especially profitable for Univex as well as other US camera manufacturers, such as Argus.  Mostly, they were subcontractors to larger companies such as Bausch and Lomb, and produced optical instruments such as binoculars.  While the wars years were profitable, the post-war period saw Univex (as well as Argus and others, but not Kodak) struggle to a degree to provide quality cameras to a more demanding audience.The Universal Mercury IIUniversal’s best camera at the time was the Mercury II, which while odd-looking, was capable of producing good half-frame images on 35mm film.   The other cameras they produced were certainly not high-end.  The Buccaneer was a 35mm rangefinder camera that was supposed to compete with the Argus C3, but at $65, was pricey and not well known.  Universal also tried to capitalize on the interest of those using 120 roll film, and brought to market a series of cameras that were utilitarian and not especially popular - the Meteor, Roamer 63, Roamer I and II, and the Uniflex TLRs.  The Uniflex I and Uniflex II twin lens reflex cameras were actually pretty good, and used 120 film, like the popular (but much more expensive) Rolleiflex.  I had a Uniflex II about a decade ago, and while it worked pretty much as it should, the finish and feel of the camera was certainly not as good as the peer TLRs that came from Japan and Europe, nor as good as an American-made Ciroflex.Universal Meteor Due to a series of unfortunate labor disputes in the late 1940s, Universal’s manufacturing was backlogged with orders, and then, to top it off, a lot of cameras were returned to be fixed.  The company’s reputation suffered greatly, and incurred large debts, loss of some key designers, and the losses mounted as retailers returned unsold merchandise.   For some reason, Universal decided to capitalize on the sub-miniature camera craze (at about the time it started to cool, no less).  They threw all of their capital (raised by selling off a lot of their inventory and parts of the other products) into producing the Universal Minute-16, a “spy camera” that looks like a tiny movie camera, and debuted in November 1949 at a price of $7.95.  A three-pack of the film was $1.00.  By 1952, Universal was bankrupt, and most of its assets were liquidated. However, a tiny remnant of the company reincorporated in Massachusetts and continued to produce the Minute-16 cameras, film, parts, and also do the film processing.  Finally, in 1964, the Universal Company was once again liquidated and all operations ceased.   One thing that had to be a factor in the demise of the Universal cameras - was their non-standard film loads which were made by no other manufacturer than Universal/Gevaert.  Serious photographers shunned the Universal products because of that, and since Kodak, Agfa, and other major film manufacturers didn’t make the Universal films, camera owners could not reap the benefit of the new emulsions from Rochester.  I suspect that a lot of the cameras sold had one or two rolls run through them and the owners put the cameras in the closet and moved onto something better.Now, back to the Minute-16 (an in minute in size, not minute in time).  Tiny camera!First of all, the Minute-16 is tiny. It’s all-metal design gives it some heft.  There is a tripod socket on the bottom of the camera, and the flip up viewfinder is on the top. The shutter speed is 1/50th sec., and the original Minute-16 has three apertures f/6.3, f/11, and f/16.  The later version also has an f/8 setting.  There is no focus adjustment, as the fixed focus goes from 3 feet to infinity.  A lever on the right side is pushed down to advance the film. The shutter release is also on the right side - a simple metal button.   It’s very ingenious, really, and the patented 16mm cassette slips into the camera from the back.  As a tiny camera, the Minute-16 is theoretically pretty good.  There is a tripod socket on the bottom of the camera.   Compare this to the Tynar that Mark Dalzell talks about, and it’s obvious that the Tynar is a bad ripoff of the Minute-16, and even more of a box camera than it looks. The Minute-16 was sold singly, and with various accessories, including a box with every item available for it. I chuckle at the flash, which absolutely dwarfs the camera.My goal is to find a cassette to load with some 16mm b&w film, just to see if I can get some images from it.  I know that the Minute-16 was plagued with reliability issues, especially regarding the film transport mechanism.  This one appears to be fully functional.  I’ll bet that the original owner ran only the one roll through it, and put it back into the box.  Such was the case for many Univex cameras.  So, if you have a cassette, let me know!"},
{"title": "A Visit to Blue Moon Camera in Portland, Oregon", "date": "Thursday, November 22, 2018", "text": "Jim Hair at the counter with customersIn late May, I was in Oregon for a week, and before I left, I set up an appointment to meet and interview the folks at Blue Moon Camera and Machine in Portland.  You may have heard of Blue Moon Camera (BMC) as a place to send in your film for development. That is one of the services that they offer, but the store is so much more than that.  Started in 2001, which of course, is about the time that digital started making inroads into general photography, Blue Moon Camera and Machine is a place that caters to lovers of analog processes.  Yes, they sell refurbished typewriters in the store, but their main business is film-based photography.  I spoke with Jake Shivery, the co-founder of BMC, and he is proud of their film-processing and production of optical prints for their customers.  The printing is so good, that professionals have chosen them to produce prints for gallery shows.  Of course, BMC does black and white, C-41 color, E-6 transparency film, and now, ECN-2 development for the Kodak Vision films. The Vision films (sold by the FPP store) are beautiful color 35mm cine films that have a remjet layer that must be removed during the development process.  Few commercial labs do this for the simple reason that the carbon in the remjet will contaminate the chemistry.  Cinestill has already removed the remjet layer before they sell it to you, but you pay more for their version of the Vision films because of that.  Blue Moon Camera is now one of the few labs that will process the Vision films in ECN-2 chemistry.Jim Hair of BMC (now retired) told me how much the store and employees are involved in promoting analog processes and serving as a conduit for film photographers and the involvement in the local arts community.  It's no wonder that people in the Portland area come into the store for more than just film processing.  Jim likes to use a 4x5 rotating back Graflex SLR, and took my photo outside the store.  He's an extremely knowledgeable and likable fellow, and an excellent photographer.BMC sells used and new film cameras and accessories, film, paper, and chemicals. No digital, period.  While I was there, I had to make sure that I didn't drool on the counter.  This is the kind of photo store that I remember from before digital became the driving force in camera sales.  One display case contained a number of well-crafted pinhole cameras from several companies. That may be the first time I have seen that in a camera store of any kind.  The used gear is usually sold on consignment, but it does some with a guarantee. Lots of different films for sale, including Polaroid. There was even short-dated film on sale, which I took advantage of, and I bought a bunch of Fomapan 100, Agfa APX 100, and some other oddball rolls of 35mm.David PaulinIn talking with David Paulin, I found out that BMC is the sole place for your Minox film and developing.  If you are a subminiature shooter, you probably already know this.  They carry color and b&w emulsions loaded into Minox cassettes.  I should point out that all of the sales people dress professionally. The men had white shirts and ties.  In the photo here, BMC looks timeless as David Paulin stands at the counter, backed by shelves of film cameras.While there, I also interviewed Bill Lee, a hobbyist photographer from Vancouver WA, which is just across the river from Portland.  Bill likes to use 120 film with older cameras, especially in 6x9 format.  We shared our experience with older cameras, and why we like to use them.  Bill especially likes to shoot city architecture, and the special look that the older cameras give the images is what makes them nostalgic as well as contemporary. Of course, he uses BMC to process his film.Jim Hair with his 4x5 Graflex SLR!Everyone that works at BMC is a photographer, and I have to say that I am quite envious that Portland has such a store.  When I stepped in, I felt that I was \"with my people.\"  Furthermore, I like the way that they support and nurture film photography.  Sure, it is a niche business.  However, the way that film photography has been ascending in popularity is a sign that BMC will have continued success in what they are doing.I greatly enjoyed my visit, and you can listen to the interviews on the Film Photography Podcast on Episode Number 206.  I thank Zeb Andrews for setting me up for the visit, and sorry that I missed him, as it was his day off.  Jake, Jim, and David were so very accommodating, and I thank them for their time and for the bag of BMC swag!  The Film Photography Podcast also received 3 gift certificates for developing and printing, which were given away at the August FPP Meetup in Findlay, OH.Blue Moon Camera and Machine address: Blue Moon Camera, 8417 N.

{"title": "Marcy Merrill and Junk Store Cameras", "date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2018", "text": "A Visit With Marcy Merrill of Junk Store CamerasMarcy, June 2017 in my yardOver the years, I have made many friends in the course of  my photographic endeavors, and I count Marcy Merrill as one of my \"oldest\" friends.  When I started getting interested in knowing more about old cameras, her Junk Store Cameras web site came to my attention in 2001.  At the time, I was also getting interested in collecting and using Argus cameras, which she was also doing. Now, if you have seen Marcy’s web site, you would know that she lives in Tokeland, Washington.  A perfect name for a place in a state where marijuana is now legal.   However, she is originally from Michigan, so she visits family not far from Ann Arbor.   I enjoyed her quirky sense of humor and the write-ups that she did for the cameras that she featured on her site.   She was a camera corrupter of the highest order, and I found myself looking for some of the cameras that she reviewed.   We corresponded a bit, and ended up meeting for lunch in 2008.  Since then, we have met up a few times when she is out in Michigan, and the cameras are very busy.  Our last meetup was on October 4, and we had a great day of shooting in Fenton and Holly, MI.Marcy, in Fenton, MI 10/04/18In late May of 2018, I was visiting Portland, Oregon for a week, and was able to drive up to Tokeland, Washington to visit Marcy and her husband, Bob.   The drive there was quite scenic, and their home is a feast for the eyes.  Marcy’s eclectic, bohemian/beach bum/pacific coast cottage is a true delight.  I had planned to interview her for the Film Photography Podcast, as she is a talented professional photographer, as well as a camera collector, artist, and beach-comber.  She is also a runner, and thankfully, did not try to get me to go on on a half marathon  while I was there!the dead albatrossWashaway BeachWe did a walk along Washaway Beach, so named, because, it is washing away the low-lying coastline.  Because of the currents, and because of illegal dumpers, flotsam and jetsam turn up on the beach, and Marcy has documented a lot of the things that have been found on the beach. Years ago, we thought she might have found a huge chunk of ambergris (whale vomit), but it turned out to be some sort of industrial material.  On our walk, we did not find much that was exciting, though there were millions of \"By the wind sailors\", Valella valella, which are Hydrozoan colonies that resemble jellyfish.  Washed ashore and drying, they look like used condoms, and smell kinda fishy.  Marcy found a dead albatross with a leg band, which she photographed, and sent the info along to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Turns out that it had been tagged as a nestling in Hawaii in 2003!  Obviously, the beach combing is a routine, and one never knows what will turn up.washed ashore and decaying Vellela vellela First of all, Marcy and Bob live in constant danger.  They live scant feet above sea level, and would be right in the line of any Tsunami.  Second, the ocean churns away at Washaway beach, and eventually, the beach will be at their door...in twenty years? Who knows?  They temper this dangerous situation with a house filled with whimsy, love, and cameras (and guitars), and their dog, Hawkeye.  I had the guest room upstairs, and I could hear the ocean that night.  I guess I should be worried if I did not.Over the years, Marcy’s studio, or parts of it, have appeared in many of her images.  We retreated to the studio for the interview, as Bob was having a jam session in the house with some fellow musicians.   Bob’s retired, as am I.  Retired people take their passions seriously.One of Marcy’s talents, which has garnered her some notoriety, is her beading of camera bodies, turning them into fully functional art pieces.   Her transformation of basic black bakelite cameras into polychromatic wonders is amazing.  In the photo, you can see the Brownie Hawkeye on the workbench.  I can say that she is never idle, as if idleness in this beautiful part of the world is a bad thing.   Marcy has images of her creations on her website.  I think they should be in museums. Oh, she is also beading a bicycle, which ought to be something quite unique when it is completed.We sat in her studio and talked cameras and photography for hours, examining some cameras, and sharing our knowledge.  Of course, the bottle of Jack Daniels did get close to empty by the time we were done talking.  Marcy will shoot anything that can hold a photosensitive emulsion.  Altoid boxes turned into pinhole cameras - her Pintoids, to crappy plastic cameras that calling them cameras is being generous.  She makes them work, whether to prove that she can do it, or to use them to create unique images, that will make you appreciate her artistry.   She’s a self-employed photographer, and despite being in a seemingly remote part of the country, she makes it work.  It’s not as remote as it seems, and she travels a lot.  One of her \"pet projects\" is to volunteer and promote (via her photographs) the adoption of shelter dogs and cats at PAWS of Grays Harbor.   She draws a lot of inspiration from just walking along the coast with Hawkeye and seeing the ever-changing Washaway Beach.   I should also mention her series of photographs of people wearing formal wear in inappropriate situations (#formalwearworninappropriately ).  The images are full of humor, whimsy, and are really engaging.Marcy talked about her upcoming trip to England, Scotland, and Iceland, where she was planning to donate her beaded Gala Brownie Hawkeye to a deserving person, and continuing her world peace through Junk Store Cameras tour.  She was also planning to run a half-marathon in Iceland.  I just hope that she brought enough Argus cameras with her to create a new set of Argus enthusiasts.  Two quotes:\"The picture isn’t always the end result; but just the fact that I can take a piece of plastic and make it take a photo is a reward.\"\"I have to make the camera work, or it doesn’t stay on the shelf.\"Marcy has already blogged about my visit on her site.It was a fun 24 hours in Washington, and I hope to return there again someday.  There is so much to see in the Pacific Northwest!Enjoy the interview HERE on the FPP Podcast Episode No. 206, 11/22/2018.Marcy Merrill - aka Silver Nitrate Queen - websites:Junk Store Cameras - http://www.junkstorecameras.com/Her Pintoids site - http://www.pintoids.com/Her Photography site: http://www.merrillphoto.com/"},
{"title": "The Kowa SETR - an excursion into leaf-shutter 35mm SLRs", "date": "Thursday, November 15, 2018", "text": "There are two predominant types of shutters in cameras - focal-plane shutters, and leaf shutters. Focal plane shutters typically are rubberized cloth and travel horizontally, or are Copal- square type shutters that are made of metal blades and travel vertically. The focal plane shutters are behind the lenses, right in front of the film plane.  Focal-plane shutters are found in most 35mm SLR cameras, some medium format SLRs (such at the Pentax 6x7 and Pentacon 6), in the large-format Graflex SLR RB cameras.Leaf-shutters however, are usually located within the lens assembly and are comprised of a series of thin plates (leaves) that overlap and typically operate at a maximum 1/500 sec, and because of their mode of operation, are also able to be used with a flash at any shutter speed.  Some leaf shutters may be quite simple and consist of 2 blades. Leaf shutters are found in twin lens reflex cameras (TLRs), medium format SLRs such as the Hasselblad and Kowa 6, folding roll-film cameras, large-format cameras, as well as many 35mm rangefinder and zone-focus cameras (for example, Kodak Retina and Argus).  One advantage, albeit only a slight one, is that a leaf-shutter tends to have less vibration, and is also quieter than a focal plane shutter.  This comes at a cost, as the lens assemblies are more complex to accommodate any removable lenses.  Over time, as these 35mm cameras have aged, the leaf-shutters are not as reliable and usually need a good cleaning and lubrication to maintain any usability.In 35mm cameras, the focal-plane shutter is the preferred type in SLRs and some rangefinders (Leica and Contax and the clones from Japan and the USSR).  The focal-plane shutter allows for much simpler lens systems, and thus, a far greater variety of focal lengths and mounts, as the shutter is independent of the lens being used.  In addition, a focal plane-shutter allows for much faster shutter speeds. In SLRs, focal plane shutters are behind the mirror.  The mirror flips up, the shutter fires, and the mirror returns (early SLRs required the shutter to be cocked to return the mirror). I'm not going to get into the exact mechanism of a focal-plane shutter, but there are some good online references should you want to know.That 80mm f/4 lens looks great, huh?However, there are always some camera manufacturers that do things differently. Kodak used leaf shutters in their Retina reflex cameras of the 1950s and 60s, and these are common finds.  Zeiss-Ikon used Compur leaf shutters in their Contaflex SLRs, too, and they are beautiful cameras.  Voigtlander's Bessamatic, which first appeared in 1959, featured a Compur shutter, and a built-in meter.  It had interchangeable lenses as well.  Other models of the Bessamatic were made until 1969.  All of these leaf-shutter SLRs are attractive, well-made, and collectible. The Nikkorex 35, Nikkorex Auto 35, and Nikkorex Zoom 35 are fixed-lens SLRs from 1960-1963 with leaf shutters. Not exactly up to the quality of a Nikon F,  and they are rare finds today.  They are also unlikely to be in working condition. Bought this for $5 in 2013Topcon came out with a Topcon Uni SLR in 1964, which featured through the lens metering, and a behind the lens Seikosha SLV shutter. The camera has an interchangeable lens, and the 53mm f/2 was standard.  It was also sold as the Beseler Topcon Auto 100. The Topcon Unirex followed in 1969, and it had full-aperture spot and average metering.   I didn't use the Topcon Uni all that much, but I did like the bokeh from that lens.KOWA!A very clean, uncluttered look.Now, I am finally getting around to the Japanese Kowa SLRs.  The Kowaflex first appeared in 1960, and was a pretty basic SLR with fixed 50mm lens and a Seikosha SLV shutter.  Shutter speeds were B, and 1- 1/500 sec -- pretty much the standard for leaf-shutter SLRs.  Later models had various improvements, such as meters, but still had the between the lens  Seikosha shutter  and fixed lenses.  In 1965, the Kowa SER appeared, and it featured a Seikosha leaf shutter behind the lens, a CdS metering system, and a suite of lenses that ranged from 28mm to 200mm. The Kowa SET followed in 1966, but it was a fixed lens SLR with TTL metering and Seikosha SLV shutter. The Kowa SETR and the subject of this review, was manufactured from 1968-1971.  It features TTL full-aperture metering and the Seikosha behind-the lens leaf shutter, accepts interchangeable lenses, and with the 50mm f/1.9 lens sold for about $100 in 1969.  I do not know if the lens mounts of the SER and the SETR are the same, but I am assuming that they are. My example of this camera is in very good cosmetic and mechanical condition. The serial no. is 906004.  There is no flash shoe, but I can see how one might have clipped on via the eyepiece flange.  The PC flash socket is on the front of the camera, and the top deck has only the film advance lever, shutter button, frame counter, and rewind lever.   All of the exposure controls are on the lens barrel and at the base of the lens.  This makes sense, as the shutter is behind the lens itself, but in front of the mirror, of course.  This is unlike the Retina SLRs, which have the shutter between the lenses. There is a set of rear elements that remain in place, and the front elements are the only ones that change with the lens system.  That means that the lenses can never be very fast, especially with longer focal lengths.  In the Kowa SLRs, that's not the case, as the lens unit is self-contained, and while the focal lengths are not as varied as \"normal\" SLRs, the size of the rear element is constrained by the throat diameter through the shutter assembly, so you won't see 50mm f/1.4 lenses.  The f/1.9 is pretty fast by leaf-shutter SLR standards. The filter ring takes 49mm filters.control ringsTo set the ISO, you move the ASA dial (range 10-800) to match the film speed with the maximum aperture of the lens. There is a small chrome knob on the aperture ring that is pulled out slightly to set the ISO.  Everything is nicely marked in colored paint, and is easy to see. The meter is visible in the viewfinder, and while it originally required a mercury 1.35V cell, I just used a 1.5V alkaline SR44 and the meter sprang to life.  The needle centers when you have a proper exposure, and under-exposure makes the needle go towards the top, over-exposure makes the needle go to the bottom.  No aperture or shutter speeds are visible in the viewfinder. The viewfinder is therefore, quite uncluttered and easy to use and focus. There is a microprism spot at the center to get critical focus. press in that lever on the chrome ring to remove lensLooking at the front of the camera, there is a small silver button on the lower right which is pushed in to switch to M, X, and V for flashbulb (M), Xenon strobe (X), and self-timer (V).  At the the 7 o'clock position, there is a small angled lever that when pressed, allows you to remove the lens from the body.  The ring closest to the body controls the shutter speed, and the ring above that controls the aperture.  The outer-most ring is for focus.  Overall, all are very well implemented and the camera is easy to use.  Because this is a leaf-shutter, you can fire the flash at any shutter speed, from B to 1/500 sec.  That certainly has its advantages over the focal-plane SLRs of the day which usually had a flash sync of 1/60th sec.Lens removed from the body. The camera is easy to use overall. There is a satisfying sound when the shutter is fired, and its different sounding than that of an SLR with a focal plane shutter.  I shot a test roll of Ultrafine Xtreme 400 in the Kowa SETR, and developed it in Rodinal at 1:25 dilution for 7.5 minutes.  I am quite pleased with the results. The Seikosha shutter works fine at all settings, and the exposures were well within the acceptable range. Perhaps I ended up with an exemplary example of this camera.  Using it has certainly changed my opinion on leaf-shutter SLRs a bit. My previous experience with leaf-shutter SLRs has been limited to Kodak Retinas and a Topcon Uni.  I would say that anyone considering using a Retina SLR make sure that the shutter gets a CLA, as more often than not, the shutter will need service to make the camera usable.  I'll keep using the Kowa on occasion, as it works fine, and certainly has a clean and very retro look to it.  I'll also keep my eye on eBay for additional lenses.  A working, clean, Kowa SER or SETR will probably cost you around $100.  Finding one with a full set of lenses will cost you far more."},

The Nikon Lite Touch AF, also known as the Lite Touch AF600, is a very compact 35 mm point and shoot with a plastic body, and a 28 mm f/3.5 lens.  As far as street cameras go, this could be a winner.  The camera has a retractable lens when not in use, and a blind that covers the lens when it is off.  The LCD on the top deck indicates the frame number, flash mode, and self-timer option.  The 3 tiny control buttons,which are rubberized for tactile feedback, are the on/off switch, flash mode, auto-infinity mode and self-timer.   The shutter button is on the far right, as is a rewind-button that is depressed with a ball-point pen, should you want to rewind the film before the roll is finished.simple controls, albeit tiny buttonsin the off modePanorama switch to the L of the tiny viewfinderturned on, with lens extended.The back of the camera features a PANORAMA switch, which activates the crop mask inside the camera, giving you a 13 x 36 mm frame.  The flash indicator led is next to the eyepiece.  On the bottom, is the battery chamber (CR123A battery), and tripod socket.Quick Specifications:Date Introduced - 1993Weight - 5.5 ouncesDimensions - 4.25\" W x 1.5\"D x 2.5\" HLens - 28 mm f3.5 fixed lens, 3 elements.Aperture range - f/3.5 - f/16Shutter speeds - auto, unknown as to the range.ISO range - DX-coded cassettes, 100, 200, 400, 1000.  Non-DX coded are set at ISO 100.

Apart from this, I like the camera -- it can easily fit into a pocket, and while I have only shot with it a bit, the images are respectable.  It certainly takes up little space, and is easy to carry along.  The viewfinder is tiny, as you would expect, and includes the crop lines fir the panorama mode.The Nikon Lite Touch AF 600 retailed for $210 in 1993.  Pretty pricey for a tiny P&S!  On eBay, I see them going for nearly as much, though the range is mostly from $70-$165.  Certainly cheaper than a p&s with the Yashica T or Contax T name on it.Overall, so long as the camera and LCD are in good working order, and the lens blind opens, this could be a gem of a camera.  It's rather unassuming, and there are few wide-angle P&S cameras that are as tiny and have a fixed 28 mm lens.  The panorama mode is of course, just a frame crop, but some may find it to be a nice creative feature.  It is fully auto, so you really have little to control except the flash.  You can set the focus to be on auto-infinity, which makes it a pretty quick camera to shoot with.  The self-timer can be set to take one or two images in quick succession.   The flash features red-eye reduction, auto, always flash, auto slow, and no flash settings.  Of course, the top buttons are tiny, so you have to use a fingernail to activate them.   I would probably use this camera more if I didn't have to mess around with the lens blind each time I turned it on. That may the weakness of this model.Sample images, shot on Fuji Superia Xtra 400, and home developed in the Film Photography Podcast C-41 kit."},

I shot with my Nikon FM, and it remains a great camera for trips.  I took the 50mm f/1.4, 28mm f/2.8, and 105mm f/2.5.    I only shot 6 rolls of film during the week, but I did do a lot of site scouting, and that was beneficial. Now I know why they are called the Blue Ridge MountainsThe Blue Ridge Parkway just has to be the most scenic route I have been on.  No commercial traffic, which makes the drive much better.  It seems like there was an amazing view of some sort almost continuously as we drove from Asheville NE to Blowing Rock.   I look forward to being able to drive just a few minutes to the BRP and enjoy the scenery!  NC has waterfalls galore, and I picked up a copy of Kevin Adams' \"North Carolina Waterfalls.\"  Splendid photography, and a great guide.  I look forward to doing pinhole photography at some of the waterfalls next year.Now that I am home, I have a lot of topics and reviews that have been on the back-burner and will start putting them on the blog shortly. Happy Halloween!"},

This relocation of the sensor has a couple advantages. One is that the lens cap now covers the sensor as well,  turning off the metering system and preserving battery power. Another is that metering will be correct when a filter is fitted, since the sensor is now located behind the filter. The pull-out hood reduces glare.Basic Features -Lens: Hexanon f/1.8, f=45mm 6 elements in 4 groups, 55mm filterShutter: Copal SVA (B, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500)Meter: Cds, powered by 1.3v mercury, with battery test  (using a 1.5v cell is fine)Dimensions: 138mm (width) x 82.2mm (height) x 73.5mm (thickness)Flash - PC sync socket, coldshoe on top.Meter scale visible on top deckTrue rangefinder focusingWeight: 750 gramsI owned one of these about a decade ago, and sold it, which I later regretted.  My current camera came from Becky Ramatowski in NM, aka Astrobeck on Flickr and Facebook.  I have a standard 1.5v cell in it, and so far, my shots from it have been perfect.   It’s a shutter-priority camera when in auto mode, but you can also shoot it manually and without a battery.  It takes 55mm filters, and of course, the meter works great with filters.  The slip-out lens hood is a nice touch.  The camera’s ISO settings range from 12-400, and with the fast lens, is great for most photography.   The rangefinder patch is easy to see.It certainly isn't a tiny rangefinder camera, and in size and appearance, looks much like a Minolta Hi-matic 7.    I have had it on several trips now, and found it to be a pleasure to shoot with, and switching from Shutter-Priority Auto to full manual is not a problem.  Overall, it's a keeper, and that wide aperture makes it great for shooting indoors and people close-up.  You can find these on ebay from 25-60 bucks.

{"title": "ONE ROLL REVIEW - FPP's Emulsion-X film", "date": "Sunday, October 07, 2018", "text": "I had originally meant to put this review up many months ago, but it was delayed by many things.  The reasons will become clear as I progress through the post.  The Film Photography Project's \"Emulsion-X\" is just as the name describes, an unknown film stock.  Sold as a B&W film rated at ISO 100, it was offered for those of us wanting a challenge.    Back in April, I shot one roll with my Yashica FX-7 Super while on a walk in Ann Arbor's Argo park.   I developed the film in XTOL for 8 minutes at 20°C.  When I looked at the wet film, I wasn't sure if it had even developed, as one side was sort of a gray-green and seemed opaque.  After it had hung and dried, I looked again, and holding it up to the light, I could see faint purplish images, even though it certainly looked opaque unless held up to the light.  What the hell is this film?  It was also very much curled (cupped) from side to side.  There was no way that I was going to be able to scan it, so I cut the negatives into strips and put them into a plastic preserver sheet, and set that aside under some books to flatten them out.nothing to see here!oh wait, yes there is.Well, I forgot all about that sheet of negatives, and just the other day I found them. Now, they seemed flat enough, so I loaded them into the V700 scanner and scanned away.  There was just a tiny bit of cupping, but the film flattened enough for some decent scans, which I did as b&w, at 2400 dpi.  If you looked at the negative strips, they did not look any different than back in April, but sure enough, the negatives scanned fine as b&w.  The film base seems thicker than most films, and sure is not at all like the thin polyester film bases that we see from Svema.  I really am curious.  Is it a color film gone bad?  Maybe I should try a roll in C-41 chemistry, just for the heck of it. Anyhow, the film still is mysterious.  The scans came out far better than I had hoped, and while the film is odd (okay, it's just plain weird), I managed to get something from it.  That is the fun is trying something out of the ordinary.   Yes, it is grainy, but there has to be someone out there thinking \"this film is for me!\"  I would not use it for anything important, but for an interesting \"look,\" it has its appeal.  At ISO 100, you won't need a tripod  for typical daylight shooting.  Here are some selections from that roll of film.Overall, not too shabby for an unknown film with a mystery past!"},
{"title": "Leadville, Colorado", "date": "Sunday, September 30, 2018", "text": "Colorado Trip, Part 3 of 3.Our last full day in Colorado was spent on a day trip to Leadville, the highest city in the United States.  It was a bright sunny day (like most of our days on the trip), a bit cool, and we took Rt. 6 E to Rt. 24 S, which would eventually take us to Leadville.  Our first stop was the small picturesque town of Minturn, which the Eagle River runs alongside.  There are lots of antique shops there, and I suspect a good number of people live there that work in Vail and other  nearby resort areas. Incorporated in 1904, Minturn was named for Robert Bowne Minturn, Jr, the Vice President of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad that founded the town. It's a much quieter place (at least in the summer) than Vail and Beaver Creek, for sure.Continuing past Minturn, Route 24 climbs, twists, and turns as we ascended along what's known as the \"Top of the Rockies Scenic Byway.\" Indeed, it is. Our highest part may have been through Tennessee Gap at 10,424 feet.  We stopped at a few places along the way to look and take some quick snaps.  The aspens were turning gold in some places, making for some amazing contrasts on the mountainsides.   I wasn't prepared for the broad high-altitude flat areas - some of which are rangelands.  One other point of interest was the place where Camp Hale was located. Now, a broad expanse of grasses and sagebrush, the former US Army base was where the 10th Mountain Division was formed, with the aim of training troops in mountain (9200 feet elevation) and winter warfare.  It was decommissioned after the war, but the CIA used it in the 1960s to secretly train Tibetan Guerillas.  Finally, in 1965 the camp was dismantled, and pretty much everything removed.  You can get a better idea of the area from Google Earth, and it's hard to imagine 14,000 soldiers there.  Leadville must have had a lot of business, as there were few nearby places to go for a drink.  Anyway, it was a nice little stop to look and ponder it all.Finally, we arrived in Leadville, and I was immediately struck by three things -- the colorful buildings, the clear dark blue sky, and that I wished I had an oxygen tank. Leadville is 10,152 feet above sea level, and to this Great Lakes flat-lander I might as well have been in Nepal.  I was slowly getting acclimated to Avon, but going up a flight of stairs at a Leadville antique store left me panting. People were attracted to the area of present-day Leadville by the lure of placer gold in 1859.  Later, the town was founded in 1877 by  mine owners Horace Tabor and August Meyer at the start of the Colorado Silver Boom. The town was built on the desolate flat land below the tree line. Over the years, it has been tied to mining silver and molybdenum, with the ups and down in the economy as a result.  Tourism is a big business now, but nearby mines also contribute to the economy. At its altitude, you get a good feel for alpine and subarctic environments.Walking around town was a Kodachrome (if there was still Kodachrome) experience.  Many brightly painted buildings along the main street, and the side streets featured small houses that were gaily painted, some with bric-a-brac, like Victorian mansions. However, most of the houses were less than 800 square feet!  I was unprepared for the visual feast, and I would love to return there for a couple of days to do the place justice with my Mamiya C330 and color film.The entrance doorway to the Saloon. How many feet havetrod through here?antique store windowWe ate a great lunch at the Silver Dollar Saloon, which dates from 1879, and is one of the oldest bars in continued operation in the US.  There are lots of memorabilia in the bar, and if you are going to be in Leadville, you'll be missing a lot if you don't stop in.  We had planned on going to the Mining Museum, but by the time we were done poking around, it was only 30 minutes until closing time, so we instead went over to the train depot, where the Colorado and Southern Railroad Station still stands.  Not only that, they have a daily tourist run on the Leadville, Colorado & Southern Railroad. That will have to wait for another time, as our day was getting late.   We left Leadville, and took a much shorter and faster Route 91 back to I-70 and Vail, and got to see the mining operations near Climax.  Some difference from Route 24!  Leadville certainly bears a return trip for a few days another time.The next day, we drove Bev to the Denver Airport so she could return to Michigan, and Adrienne and I continued S into New Mexico.  We had a fantastic week in Colorado."},
{"title": "Getting Comfortable with the Leica M2", "date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2018", "text": "Colorado Trip, Part 2 of 3I acquired my Leica M2 in 2014, and over the span of 4 years, I never took it along as my only 35 mm film camera. That changed on my trip to Colorado earlier this month.  Yes, I packed the Nikon D300 as my main camera, but as it turned out, the M2 was often my walk-around camera as the trip went on.   Mostly, I shot b&w film with it, and the more I used it, the more I felt at ease with it.  One could say that we \"bonded\" on the trip.  After finally going through 1000 images in Lightroom from the D300, and then developing and scanning the 7 rolls of film from the M2, the film was a more relaxing and I think, more rewarding process.  First of all, nearly all of my M2 shots were what I would call \"dead on\" in terms of exposure.  Yeah, b&w film has enough latitude to cover minor exposure errors, but the thing is, being in an all-manual, no built-in meter situation made me think more about the image and proper settings before I pressed the shutter button.  In outdoor situations in the SW, it's almost always sunny-16 during the day, and my years of experience, intuition, and sometimes my pocket light meter, got me through the rest.Our condo, Avon, CO. Ilford HP-5+Avon, CO. Ilford HP-5+Bev and Adrienne, Bob's Place tavern.  Ilford HP-5+I wanted to test myself this time -- what could I expect if I went somewhere and ONLY shot with a rangefinder?  As I grew more relaxed with the Leica, it became all the easier to shoot anything with it.  At heart, I have always been an SLR user, and of course, there are many situations when an SLR's capabilities will favor its use.  Long lenses and rangefinder cameras just are not a good combo.  My M2 has the Canadian-made 35mm f/1.4 Summilux, and is that lens sharp.  In the process, I found that the 35mm point of view was a really great choice for the landscape and skies of the West.  The more I shot, the better I felt about my choice.  As I am going through the negatives now, I am very pleased with my results.Vail, CO  Ilford HP-5+Pioneer Cemetery, Glenwood Springs COIlford HP-5+Pioneer Cemetery, Glenwood Springs COIlford HP-5+Pioneer Cemetery, Glenwood Springs COIlford HP-5+Somewhere, I saw a line that basically said that B&W is an interpretation of the scene, not as how it really looks.  And of course, that is true.  There are many instances when I see something colorful and knowing that it's the colors that make the image, I don't take a b&w photo.  In the West, however, the  landscape and skies are contrasty, the landscape structured, and oooh the shadows!    The Saguaro cacti in Tuscon were tremendous, and even more so  when I shot them with the M2.  My films were Ilford HP-5+,  Kodak Tmax 400, Ultrafine Xtreme 400, and Agfa APX 100.  All look great.   I didn't use any filters over the 35mm lens, as I don't have an adapter for filters.  Still, the shots look fine.With a camera such as the M2, I wasn't fiddling with the camera.  I was more connected to my final images than I was with the D300, for sure.  The M2 is simple, easy to use, and has a great lens. The viewfinder is wonderful, and of course, the camera is lighter around the neck than the D300 or any other film SLR.I think now, that I could be fully confident of coming back with great photos from a long trip with nothing but the M2, a bunch of  film, and a simple light meter.

{"title": "Center for Creative Photography", "date": "Saturday, September 22, 2018", "text": "A Visit to the Center for Creative PhotographyMy trip to CO, NM, and AZ resulted in the crossing off of some \"bucket list\" items.   I have long wanted to visit the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) in Tucson, AZ.  Founded in 1975, the Center for Creative Photography houses the archives and images of many of the premier photographers of our time.  Starting with Ansel Adams, it has become one of the world's finest photography museums and research centers.  From the CCP's materials:\"Beginning with the archives of five living master photographers—Ansel Adams, Wynn Bullock, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, and Frederick Sommer—the collection has grown to include 270 archival collections. Among these are some of the most recognizable names in 20th century North American photography: W. Eugene Smith, Lola Alvarez Bravo, Edward Weston, and Garry Winogrand. Altogether there are over eight million archival objects in the Center's collection including negatives, work prints, contact sheets, albums, scrapbooks, correspondence, writings, audiovisual materials and memorabilia. In addition to whole archival collections the Center also actively acquired individual photographs by modern and contemporary photographers. There are currently more than 90,000 works by over 2,200 photographers. A library of books, journals, and exhibition and auction catalogs including many rare publications plus an extensive oral history collection complements the archival and fine print collections. The combined art, archival, and research collections at the Center provide an unparalleled resource for research, exhibitions, loans, and traveling exhibitions.\"   Please pinch me.  So many amazing photographers have their work at the Center for Creative Photography!    Wow.  In contrast to museums where photography is but a minor part, the CCP's ONLY mission is photography.We were in Tucson for several days, and we visited the CCP after a visit to the San Xavier del Bac Mission, itself a photographic subject of Ansel Adams and others.  The CCP is located on the campus of the University of Arizona, and once we found a parking spot in a UA parking garage, we trekked across campus to the museum.  Tucson was about 105F that day, and yes, it was a dry heat. I get that.  Once inside the CCP, we saw that it was free, and there were several exhibits.  The first one --  Longer Ways to Go: Photography of the American Road, is excellent.  Much of the exhibit  contains photos  of  places along Route 66 by Kozo Miyoshi, a Japanese photographer and former artist in residence at the Center for Creative Photography. Taken in the 1990s, the large photographs are documentary in nature, exploring the sometimes drab and yet surviving places of the old highway.   Photographs by others that encompass the theme of the American Road are arranged by thematic aspects -- such as view from the car window, and our love affair with the automobile and the scenes from the highway.  Many favorite photographers are represented here, such as Gary Winogrand (and all this time I thought he was only a NYC photographer!), Ansel Adams, Ed Ruscha, Lee Friedlander, Robert Frank, and many others.  In addition, the show also has small Google Streetview images to show the spots as they look now.  In some cases, little change, in others... ugh.  I found  Miyoshi's work to be excellent, and he's now someone I am looking to see more of.  I ended up buying a copy of Miyoshi's monograph \"Far East and Southwest\" at the CCP gift shop.After seeing that exhibit, we went to the next one, The Heritage Gallery.  Again, so many favorite photographers and some new and interesting ones, too (at least to me). From the Center for Creative Photography materials: \"Inspired by the Center’s legacy, the Heritage Gallery features iconic treasures from the collection alongside more recent acquisitions. The story of the Center is told through pairings and groupings of images that explore the relationships between contemporary practice and the photographic foundations that inspired them. The gallery will be rotated twice a year, offering visitors a chance to make new discoveries, sparking inquiry and dialogue.\" This show  featured work by Ansel Adams, David Maisel, Patrick Nagatani, Lynn Stern, Giorgia Valli, Edward Weston and Garry Winogrand.    It was such a wonderful exhibit, with lots to images to mull over and think about.  In between the exhibits was a large flat file case with pull-out drawers, with selections inside from the CCP archives!  Wonderful stuff. Open up a drawer or two and see examples from the archives of Ansel Adams!Overall, this was a most impressive visit, and if I lived anywhere near Tucson, I would be there often.An Ansel Adams drawer...A page from Weston's Day Books!"},
{"title": "Images... and more images from Colorado", "date": "Monday, September 17, 2018", "text": "(Part 1 of 3)I'm back from a vacation in Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.  We spent a week in the Avon, Colorado area, and did day trips to nearby places that looked interesting. We had no planned places to visit, except for the Denver Botanical Garden after we arrived in Denver.  It was great to stay at a friend's condo for free, and not to have to stay in a motel for a week.  We were able to have breakfast and dinner \"at home.\"  After we settled in, I went to look up nearby points of interest, and got out the maps.  The first thing I noticed after we arrived was that my body was not used to being above 5000 feet above sea level.  Chalk part of that up to age (61), and living in Michigan for the past 37 years.  I try and walk at a fast pace at least 2 miles most days of the week, and I have to wonder how much worse I would have felt had I not.  Avon is about 7400 feet, and as the week wore on, I felt more acclimated.  However, some of the days we were over 10,000 feet, and in Leadville, going up some stairs was pretty breath-taking.  The second thing I noticed was the sky.  The West has LOTS OF SKY.  Whether you are in the mountains of Colorado, or the deserts of Arizona, the sky is something. I'll talk more about that later.As I noted in my previous post, I brought my D300 SLR and a bag of lenses, my Leica M2, Yashica A TLR, and a Debonair plastic camera.   I shot about 1000 images on the D300 over the span of almost two weeks, and I have yet to develop the film that I shot with the film cameras.  My M2 got lots of use, and the more I shot with it, the more it became almost second-nature to use. At times, I left the D300 in the car and just brought along the Leica and the Yashica.  My plan was to bring along my Chromebook laptop and backup my digital shots to my Google Drive every night.  That worked great, and was pretty much automatic.  I enjoyed the Chromebook's instant-on, ease of use, and light weight.  The only thing I also had to bring was a CF card reader to get the files from the D300. It also allowed me to post some photos online during the trip. While my Instagram feed from my phone was also used for Instagram and Facebook, the images I take with my DSLR are going to be different, so it was nice to be able to post those for a change. In the past, I have brought along my iPad, but a real laptop offers me more flexibility. The Chromebook fills the niche quite well.After we returned to Ann Arbor, I uploaded my images from the CF card into Lightroom, and started the still-ongoing image selection and editing process.   I'll start developing the film this week, and will scan the negatives ASAP.   I have been shooting film so much, and digital so much less, that I don't think I was prepared for the number of images to go through in Lightroom.  I'm still at it, and of course it's great to look at them and think about where I was and what we were doing when I shot the image.The Denver Botanic Gardens was a good way to start the trip, and see a bit of Denver in the process.  It always has amused me to think that Denver is in a flat plain, yet is a mile high.  Flying there is an instant intro to the higher elevation, whereas driving west, you get the sense of change gradually.   We had rented a 2018 Ford Edge at the airport for our driving around for 2 weeks, and I appreciated the mapping and directions on the console. It was a new experience for me, and it really made a difference in getting to destinations without any hassle.Giant Spreadwing damselfly in the GardensWho knew that a shot of the waterlilies would get over 55,000view on Flickr's Explore?The gardens are extensive, and our 2 hour visit was all thetime we had, as we wanted to be in Avon before sundown.So much to see! We had only a short visit at the Denver Botanic Gardens, as we needed to be in Avon before sundown. We arrived at the condo just before sunset, and it was a great scenic drive.  Avon is not far from Vail, and the area is mainly geared for skiing. I am not a skier, and of course, everything was green. There is still lots to see and do if you are not there in the winter.  Of course, that means we did some day trips, and I'll post some images from a few of them.  Colorado IS stunning.  I have visited other parts of it in the past, but all those trips were long-drive days, without the benefit of having a home base to start from.  I really enjoyed our stay in Avon.View from our patioMorning in AvonOur first day there was spent getting groceries and checking out the Avon area.  The next day, we headed to Glenwood Springs. We drove along highway 6 until we got to Gypsum, then it was I-70. What a tremendous experience it was driving through Glenwood Canyon along the the highway! We crossed the Colorado River numerous times, and the view was just amazing.You see a lot of weathered buttes like this.  Along Eagle Creek.Along the Colorado River off I-70.

At the last minute, I decided to throw in a toy camera, the Debonair.  It doesn't add much to the weight, and will be fun to find the right subjects with it.   My Manfrotto tripod goes in my checked suitcase.The last time I visited NM and CO was in 2003, and that was a fun family vacation. We drove the entire trip, and between my daughter Jorie and I we had probably a dozen cameras in the van.  We shot a LOT of film.I learned on that trip that one can have way too many cameras on a trip, and to not duplicate functionality.  So, while the DSLR will be used for a lot of the scenery and wildlife, the Yashica TLR and the Leica M2 will have their place, shooting b&w, and giving me that analog satisfaction.  Because I am shooting a lot of digital on the trip, I need to make sure that I can backup my files and do some sharing on social media (including this blog).  I bought an 11\" Chromebook just for that purpose, and it will take up a lot less space than my laptop, and give me more functionality than my iPad.One of these days I'll make a trip with just one camera, but I don't see it happening anytime soon!"},
{"title": "ONE ROLL REVIEW - Lomochrome Purple XR 100-400", "date": "Wednesday, August 29, 2018", "text": "Earlier this year, I was able to purchase a roll of LomoChrome Purple from the Film Photography Project store. For those that are not familiar with this film, it's a C-41 color film that is rated at 100-400 ISO, with the results looking much like a color infrared film.  However, it's not an IR film, but an emulsion that is definitely quite unusual and enables some creative imagery.Lomography 's LomoChrome Purple XR 100-400 comes in 35mm cassettes and 120 rolls - when it is available.  Like some other Lomography films, it sells out quickly when it is announced. My previous review of LomoChrome Turquoise was based on the only roll I was able to obtain, and that was such an interesting film to experiment with that I wish I'd had a few more. After shooting the one roll of LomoChrome Purple, I wish I had purchased 10 rolls.  This is definitely a fun film to shoot with.  Greens turn to purples and red, blue skies go cyan, and other predictable color shifts and contrast changes occur depending on what ISO you shoot with. Since it is not an IR film, you do not need any filters to get the IR-like effects.I loaded my Yashica FX-7 Super with a roll while on a trip to Oregon, back in late May.  I set my ISO at 200, figuring it was the best choice, based on the reading I had done.  I shot about half of the roll at the Portland Japanese Garden, and the other half while visiting the famous Multnomah Falls, not that far from Portland. I really did not know what my results would be like, and the exposed film sat in my darkroom for a few months until I got around to doing a bunch of C-41 processing.After developing, I saw that the film does not have the typical orange base color of a typical C-41 film.  The negatives looked odd, as they should, since this film has strange, but predictable color shifts.   I scanned them with my Epson V700 scanner, and here are some examples from the roll of film:Obviously, this film isn't for everyone.  Some will deride it because \"things don't look that way.\"  I find it to a lot of fun to shoot with, giving a pleasing and less intense result than from color IR.  The problem is that the film usually is not on the shelves very long, and sells out within a short time.   I should have bought a few more rolls at the outset, and I hope that Lomography runs another batch soon.  The beauty of this and similar films is that it's all done in the camera, not via digital trickery.  In fact, I am not sure one could do this easily in a digital camera.  With the LomoChrome purple -- just point and shoot!"},
{"title": "A Quick Review of the Olympus 35 LC Camera", "date": "Friday, August 24, 2018", "text": "If you ask film users about Olympus 35mm rangefinder cameras, there is no doubt that you'll hear about the popular Olympus 35 RC, the Olympus XA, and probably the Olympus 35 SP. It's unlikely that you'll hear a peep about the Olympus 35 LC.  While the 35 LC was produced from 1967 to perhaps 1970, it just does not seem to be as commonly seen as the subsequent Olympus rangefinder cameras.Last year, I happened to come across an Olympus rangefinder camera that I had never seen before.  The Olympus 35 LC is an interesting 35mm rangefinder with a CdS light meter.  It's not auto-anything, and is somewhat on the large size, compared to the later Olympus 35 RC.  The 35 LC features a 42mm f/1.7 Zuiko lens, shutter speeds from 1 sec to 1/500 sec + B, an ISO range of 10 to 800, and an easily focused lens with a lever on the lens barrel.  This is a nice all-metal camera, with a very quiet shutter.  There is both a PC socket and a hot shoe for the flash.  The meter needle shows both in the viewfinder and in a window on the top deck of the camera.  The meter requires a mercury cell for 1.3 V, but I used a 1.5V silver-oxide cell, as that will be close-enough for b&w and C-41 films.    The bright-frame viewfinder is large and has parallax correction.  The RF focus patch is easy to see, making the camera a joy to focus.  No squinting into a tiny window with this camera.    Since the CdS meter window is inside the lens ring, you can use filters and the camera will meter through them for proper exposures.The Olympus 35 LC stands out as being larger than the compact 35 RC.  Released in 1967, it predates the smaller SP and RC rangefinders by 2-3 years.  The 35LC dimensions are  138 mm W x 81 mm H x 70 mm D. Compare that to the 35 RC, which is 110 mm W x 70mm H x 50mm D.  While it's a larger camera, it feels right in the hands, much like a Konica Auto S2. The Olympus 35 LC features:Lens: G.Zuiko 42mm f1.7, 7 elements in 5 groups, 55mm filter ringApertures: f/1.7 - f/16Shutter: Copal-X, speeds B, 1-1/500 sec.Meter: CdS cell, inside the filter threadViewfinder: Bright frame viewfinder with parallax correction.Film speed: ASA 10 to 800.Self timer: on lens barrelTripod socket centered Flash- PC  socket on left side, standard hot shoe, x-sync onlyPower: 1.3v mercury for meter - I used a 1.5 V cell with good results.Weight: 660 grams.The meter is actuated by a button on the top right of the rear of the camera body. You can use the top-mounted display to see where your settings are centering the needle (or not), or you can use the display that appears in the viewfinder.  There is no auto setting. The camera has a fast 42mm f/1.7 lens.  The 42mm focal length makes it just slightly wider than the standard 50mm that we consider \"normal.\"  By comparison, the Olympus 35 RC has a maximum aperture of f/2.8 with its 42mm lens, which makes it more compact, but definitely not as capable.  The shutter speed range on the 35 LC is B, and 1- 1/500 sec, with all of the standard intervals.  You can use any 55mm screw-on filter, and the CdS cell will give you an accurate reading through the filter. Of course, with a polarizer, you won't be able to see the maximum effect like you would in an SLR.I find the camera to be pleasant to use. The focus ring has a lever to grip, and the focus range is just under 3 feet to infinity.  The outer ring on the lens barrel comtrols shutter speed, and the inner ring controls aperture. Each has a different feel, making the operation easier without looking.  The shutter is very quiet, and the film advance is a single stroke.  It's not as light as my Olympus Trip 35, but then again, this is a far more capable camera, not a point and shoot.  I love the logo on the front -- rather old-school, and it looks like a quality camera.   I see the 35 LC on eBay for around $100 for good examples.  As a quality camera, this is a steal.As always, the proof is in the results. Marquette, MI, Tri-XAnn Arbor, MI.

{"title": "A Quick Review of the Minolta A5 rangefinder camera", "date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2018", "text": "I like the simple large M for the logo!Minolta had a series of non-automated rangefinder cameras, starting with the Minolta 35 in 1947. The 35 model morphed into a series of ever more sophisticated Leica clones that are typical of many post-war rf cameras from Japan.  They were followed a series of RF cameras that had non-interchangeable lenses beginning with the Minolta A in 1955. The A series have the shutter between the lenses, a viewfinder with the rangefinder patch visible, and a 45mm lens that was either an f/2.8 or f/3.5. The A and A2 were slightly boxy and had a wheel on the top of the camera for setting the shutter.  The A3 had a more sleek and conventional design, and appeared in 1959.  As far as I know, there was no A4, but the A5 was released in 1960, and there were three models:Japanese models - f/2.0 or f/2.8 45mm lenses, B- 1/1000 shutter speed.USA model - 45mm f/2.8 lens and B, 1-1/500 shutter.The model that I have must be a Japanese version, since it has:45mm f/2.8 Rokkor, 4 element lens  Citizen shutter, B, 1-1/1000 sec cold shoe with PC connector on lens, m and X-syncLater models of the A5 have a hot shoe (about 1965-66).None of the A series cameras have any sort of meter, and therefore, do not need batteries.  With it being an all-mechanical camera, you are spared the aging selenium or CdS meters, non-obtainable batteries, and/or electrical problems of the more automated cameras of that time. The Minolta A5 was the last model before the Hi-Matics were introduced in 1962.This is a nice all-mechanical RF camera with a Citizen between the lens shutter. With its bright viewfinder, easy opperation, and impressive range of shutter speeds, it's a fun camera to take anywhere.  No meter? No problem -- sunny-16, external meter, or the Black Cat Exposure Guide.I find the A5 quite easy to use, and its control layout is simple. The apertures range from f/2.8- f/22, and the 45mm Rokkor lens is sharp!  There is an exposure counter on the top deck, and I like the way the rewind lever folds down as to not catch on anything.  The self-timer and X or M flash synch are located on the lens barrel.  The rings for the shutter speed and aperture are easily turned, and the focus ring has a nice little bump out to rest your thumb on. It has an extremely quiet operation. There is a film speed reminder wheel on the back door of the camera, and a tripod socket and rewind release on the bottom plate. The serial number of my camera is 125061.Here are some scans from a recent roll of Svema 125 C-41 film that I shot.I don't know how often the 1/1000 version turns up, but it certainly is a nice camera to shoot with. You can also find a nice review of the A5 at Mike Eckman's excellent site."},
{"title": "In Praise of the Nikon F", "date": "Wednesday, August 08, 2018", "text": "First released in 1959, the Nikon F became the dominant SLR among professionals due to its ruggedness, reliability, full complement of accessories, and ease of use.  The modular approach with different viewfinders allowed Nikon to upgrade the metering system without having to revamp an entire camera. The Nikon F was discontinued in 1974, after being replaced by the F2 in 1971. Fifteen years is a long time, and while the F was certainly not the only Nikon SLR produced over that span, it remains an iconic SLR. Over 860,000 Nikon F bodies were produced in that time, and I wonder how many are still working today. My guess is that most of them do.The Nikon F was the first Japanese SLR to have:100% coverage in the viewfinderMirror LockupInterchangeable focus screensFull Pro system from day 1 (a huge range of lenses on day 1)250 exposure backelectric motorized winder that could be attached to the bodytitanium foil shutterI'm not going to provide an exhaustive history of the Nikon F, as it's certainly covered elsewhere on the web and in various publications.  For some great resources, check out the following two books:The New Nikon Compendium.

(ring bound with 14 chapters + index).and web sites:Camera Quest's Nikon F History Casual Photophile's Nikon F Retrospective Mike Eckman's 1966 Nikon F Okay, back to my story. I first held a Nikon F around 2000-2001, when I was moving a bunch of equipment around where I worked at the UM Museum of Zoology.  A Photomic F belonged to a curator who had used it extensively in Australia in the late 1960s, and through the 1980s.  The worn leather bag held the camera and 3 lenses - 50mm f/2, 55mm micro-Nikkor, and the 200mm f/4, as well as an M extension tube.  That was my first contact with the camera, and while I thought the Nikon F with the Photomic finder was ungainly, the view through the lens was fantastic.  Plus, what was with the funky twist and turn when I mounted the lens?  Compare the Nikon twist with the predominant M-42 mount that was available in 1959, and one can see how much better it was.  The \"Nikon twist\" - was to index the lens to the maximum aperture, which all of the non-AI lenses required with the Photomic finders on the F and F2, as well as the Nikkormats (until the FT-3).  AI lenses - Auto-Indexing, which came later, was achieved with a small tab on the base of the lens that engaged a matching cam on the lens mount. If you had a plain prism or waist-level finder on the F, you did not have to index the lens. I found that old camera to be a challenge, but I was already a Nikon fan, having been the recipent of an N-50 and lenses from my mentor, Bill Brudon.  I eventually was given a Nikon F by someone that was cleaning out his accumulation of \"stuff.\" It too, was a Nikon F with the Photomic finder.  Later, I bought an F2 which I used for quite a while. Over the years since, several Nikon Fs have come my way.  While the metered Photomic finders may have had problems, the bodies did not. My daughter also liked the Nikon F with a plain prism.  It was simple, less heavy than the Photomic version, and just looked awesome.  No meter? No problem, sunny-16 or a hand-held meter.For a while, I divested myself of any Fs and then earlier this year, this lovely Nikon F with a nice plain prism found me.  I'm keeping this one.  It is a superb example of the iconic camera.  Plus, with a 50mm f/2 Nikkor-H lens, it's a lot of fun to shoot with.  Using a Nikon F with the plain prism is as basic as you can get.  No meter, only the aperture ring on the lens, the shutter speed dial, and the shutter button, and film advance. It is very similar to using a Leica M2 in that aspect.  The Titanium-foil shutters of the Nikon F seem to last forever, unlike the cloth and rubber shutters found on the Pentax Spotmatics. The only area where the F is lacking would be in using a flash.  Because the finders are removable and interchangeable, the flash contacts are over by the rewind crank.  To use a flash connected directly to the camera with a hot shoe, you need the AS-1 flash adapter, which works with any flash with a standard hot shoe.  The original Nikon F flash adapter is a cold-shoe, and you connect to the X-sync PC socket on the body with a short cable.  You can also use a flash attached to a flash holder that screws onto the tripod socket, which also requires a PC cord.  The big potato-masher flashes of years past were connected this way. Flash sync is 1/60 sec, slow by today's standards. You may also be a bit confused on how to rewind the film, as there is no release on the bottom of the camera.  The collar that surrounds the shutter release button is rotated to \"R\" to rewind. Make sure it is rotated back to \"A\" to advance the film.  If you want to use a cable release with the F, you'll need to find a Leica-style cable release, or an adapter that screws onto the collar to allow a standard cable release to fit.  These are minor quirks that F users are familiar with.If you have a Nikon F with the metered prism, such as the Photomic, you'll have to use hearing-aid batteries (zinc-air), because the meters required mercury cells. Of course, you can use Alkaline cells, and if you are using C-41 film, it probably won't make much of a difference in your results.  In addition, due to the age of the finders, they may not work at all, or be unreliable.  This is why I prefer the plain prism finder.I took my F along on a trip to Collingwood, Ontario last month.  Sometimes I used a hand-held meter, sometimes I used sunny-16, and trusted my instincts.  I shot a couple of rolls of film, one of them being Fomapan 100, which I developed in HC110-B.  Here are a few images from that roll. I found the camera to be a joy to use, and its robust yet ergonomic construction just invites one to use it.  There is no chintzy feel to this camera whatsoever.   In fact, it could stop a bullet.    I only need mine to stop time for a fraction of a second.  It does that quite well."},
{"title": "Kodak Master Photoguide - Filmtastic Resource!", "date": "Wednesday, August 01, 2018", "text": "When I got my first SLR, an Exa Ia, in 1973, I was eager to learn as much as I could about photography.  I don't recall what books I may have looked at in high school, but I did buy a current (at the time) Kodak Master Photoguide.  That little black pocket-sized ringbound book served me well for years, and I still have it tucked away somewhere.  For the longest time, it was my only photographic resource. When I think about it,  never had a light meter, and the Exa IIa had a very limited range of shutter speeds.  The Master Photoguide was my source for exposures, flash photography, and Kodak film information. My most recent example of the Master Photoguide dates from 1981, and I don't know how much later they were produced, but I would assume that they stopped making them by the late 1990s.  Back in the day, it was (and still is) a good thing to have in your camera bag.  If you are new to manual film cameras, the Master Photoguide is an easy way to have a lot of information at hand. There were subtle changes in the Master Photoguide over the years, as camera and film technology changed.  I like the older ones that actually had the filter gels in the page.  That makes them useful for seeing how a filter changes how the image looks to your eye.  The guide also has the \"filter factor\" chart to adjust your exposure for a given filter.  If you have a meterless camera such as a Nikon F with a plain prism, a Kodak Retina IIa, or a Yashica A TLR, the guide is quite handy. To me, the genius of the guide is that all of the subjects are located by the tabs at the edge of the page.  A quick looks takes you right to the appropriate topic.  Secondly, the guide has the essential information that a photographer needs without the fluff that may be found in a much larger book.1966 version with color gels While a lot of old Kodak publications can be found online as  PDF files, the Master Photoguides have wheels inside that you move to get the appropriate exposure, as in the daylight exposure dial.  That makes the real thing all the more desirable.The durable covers and binding will give you years of service, and my old beat-up guide is 45 years old!I did a brief look online, and the Master Photoguides now sell for more than they did when new.  They are often most encountered in old camera bags and thrift shops, so keep your eyes open for the various editions.  The most recent one has a silvery cover, and is easily identified. the tabs are very handy.The daylight exposure guide looks suspiciously like it is based on Sunny-16.  Yes, it is!"},

I will be considering that aspect more seriously in the coming months.  Some images meant a great deal to me at the time, and in retrospect, have less interest to me now, and others that I may have thought less of at the time, and may even hardly remember now, have more significance.  That's the thing when I shoot digital -- it's easy to take a lot of photographs and experiment with the lenses and controls at the time of exposure to make a shot \"just so.\"  The instant feedback is certainly a creative bonus.  However, I found that some of the results were exactly what I was getting with some of my \"toy cameras,\" where I may have only taken one shot of a scene.I am enjoying looking at images from 10 years ago, and seeing how my photography has changed -- not just subject matter, but also the quality of the image.  I will still be shooting some similar subjects as a decade ago, but am choosier about it now.Along the way, I looked at a series of images from June 2016, when we were visiting my mother-in-law (Charlotte Murphy) and family for her 90th birthday.  Looking at them now, I was probably thinking at the time -- when will we be back to her house again?  I shot a series of images inside the house that to me, captured how I would always think of her home.  Charlotte is still doing well at 92, and I am impressed with her mental acuity and ability to be on her own.  I tell her she's my favorite MIL, and that always get a bit of a chuckle.  After knowing her for 42 years, she's probably heard most of my jokes at least twice.the road to the farmapple treesCat and stairsCorner cupboardFamily Living room with desk and empty gun rackMementos on the mantleThere is a different look to the two sets of images - indoors vs outdoors.  The interior images, taken in the quiet morning are relatively sharp and focused.  The \"memories\"  are the objects depicting memories.  Trinkets from trips, photographs, paintings, and the accumulation of a lifetime.  These are purposefully shot to indicate those things.  On the other hand, the outdoor images, shot with a CCTV lens on a Nikon 1J1 camera,  are blurred, in soft-focus, and somewhat surreal.  That's because we have a memory of the farm as it once was - a working dairy farm with many acres of land and crops.  Now, it's a horse farm, owned by someone else, and partitioned off.   While I photographed it in 2016, my mind was still imagining the scene of 40 years ago.    That's how minds work.  Our reality is shaped by our experiences.  Memories are plastic, as well.  I think this is why toy cameras such as the Diana and the Holga are great at producing images that make us think of memories.old silosfence and treesThe flagAs I looked through the images from the farm, I realized that I have many such series that have \"photo essay\" all over them.  I will try and do more of these in the coming months."},

On Tuesday (07/03/2018), I lost my best friend, Marcelino (Marc) Akemann (born 10/27/1956).  Marc had been battling non-small-cell lung cancer for over a year, and the latest treatments had him feeling quite positive and feeling good.  He drove over to the house for a visit on Saturday, and we laughed and had a good time. He also got see to my daughter Jorie, who was down for a few days from Marquette.  I took a photo of the two of them in front of Hound, the Jeep Cherokee that Marc bought from her a few years ago.  I gave him a big hug, and he drove home.  On Monday afternoon, he suffered a massive brain hemorrhage, and died peacefully Tuesday afternoon in the ER surrounded by family (and Adrienne and I, who arrived just moments earlier).  It was a surreal scene for me, to see a man that had just a few days ago, been talking about the future, lying still, and never again being part of this world.Marc and I met for the first time in late 2007, when he showed up at my house for a Crappy Camera Club Meeting. We had actually talked earlier that year when he visited the A3C3 \"Cheap Shots\" exhibit in Nickles Arcade, and of course, in true Marc fashion, he remembered our conversation, while I did not.  Someone had told him that he should meet me, as we had some things in common.  I know that we quickly became friends, and by 2008, we both went to our first Photostock and traveled around together.  In the ensuing decade, we became the Marc (with a C) and Mark (with a K) show, and made many photo trips together all over Michigan.   In Facebook posts while we were travelling in 2013, it seemed that we were eating our way across the Upper Peninsula. In fact, restaurants were the only place we had good wi-fi!At the Two-Hearted River in 2013Marc was the most honest and conscientious person I have known.  He was a gentle soul that made sure those who needed help were okay, and always had time to help out if you needed him.  He was a master of constructive criticism, and rarely had bad things to say about anyone.  Both of us had common ground in many things, and we both abhorred hypocrisy. Marc served in the Air Force during the post-Vietnam era, mostly in Germany.  He was a \"fuelie\" - working with AV fuel and other ground support.  In hindsight, I have to wonder if that was the cause of his cancer. He never smoked. In the Air Force, he was able to travel a lot in Europe, and that gave him a better insight than most US citizens about other countries.  His father (Dutch) and mother (Indonesian) emigrated with Marc from the Hague to the US in the late 1950s.  His younger brothers Max, Victor, and Dimitry, and sister Nicole were born in Wisconsin.  His dad worked in the auto-industry, and Marc had tales about when his dad worked for American Motors, and they had some of those amazing cars that came out in the 1970s.Marc and I used to meet up for coffee in Dexter, where we might have first dropped off some film at Huron Camera, had a leisurely chat at Joe and Rosie's coffee shop next door, and then went back to Huron Camera to get our processed film.  In its heyday, Huron Camera was an amazing place that had just about everything, and there were always the \"treasure bins\" at the back where we found the occasional bargain.   It closed in 2014, and our subsequent Dexter meetups were less frequent.At Roos Roast, Ann Arbor, April 2017.We had so much fun traveling around together. We both had the same sense of humor, and I recall a couple of times that we saw things and had to double back and take a photo.  Marc used to have a rusting Jeep Wrangler that he drove everywhere.  It of course had a short turn radius, and he was never hesitant about making a quick U-turn to get back to the scene.  Somewhere in the thumb region of Michigan we saw a hilarious sign and we knew that if we didn't shoot, we would never get over a missed opportunity.  I included the photo in an exhibit I had at the Common Cup in Ann Arbor, and I was asked to remove it from the show.  It's here for your enjoyment, though.Travelling across the back roads of the Upper Peninsula we saw a strip club.  In the middle of nowhere (to us, at least). It seemed so out of place in the UP.Later that day, we made it to the Delta Peninsula and spent several hours at  the ghost town of Fayette, now a state historical park.  Marc and I had different approaches to our photography.  He was very deliberate, and he often used a Mamiya RB-67 and a damned heavy Gitzo tripod.  Me, I was scampering around with my much lighter Bogen tripod and usually a 35mm Nikon.  We both had a preference for Nikon cameras, and he always had a very nice black Nikon FA that he used regularly. So much so, that I regretted selling mine years earlier.  His other daily shooter was a Nikon F100 with a 50mm 1.4 (which his brother Vic had found at a garage sale for $25), and he almost always had his compact Olympus XA with him.   Of course, Marc was no stranger to GAS, and we often brought our latest acquisitions to a coffee meet-up.  He was especially fond of his nice Contaflex system, and shot with it regularly.   He had acquired some interesting gear over the years, and always took great care of it.  He had planned on getting his darkroom set up at his new place in Whitmore Lake, and then he fell ill with the cancer.One November about 6 years ago, Marc and I were on a little photo trip to the Adrian, MI area.  At some point we saw something odd in the road, so we stopped. It turned out to be an expensive shotgun in a case.  We loaded our find into my Escape, and went searching for the proper authorities to turn it in.  As it was Veteran's Day, we had a hard time locating the police, and since it was not an emergency, we had to go find the station.  It wasn't in their jurisdiction, so the Sheriff Dept. had to deal with it. When we finally found the right place, we turned in the shotgun, and Marc filled out a form.  Two days later he got a call from the owner.  Turns out the guy had taken out the case to load something else into his truck for a hunting trip, and put the gun  on top of the cap.  He drove off, not realizing that it had dropped to the ground about 500 feet from his house.  He was so grateful that he sent Marc $50, which bought the two of us lunch at Seva.  That was so typical of many of our trips -- we also ended up with a story.12/31/2012, on our River Raisin driveMarc was a regular exhibitor at our Crappy Camera Club shows, and a regular attendee at meetings.  Even if he didn't have photos to show, he was always there to help put up a show or take it down.  For him, it was a way to connect with other film shooters in a group that was not about egos or agendas.  I will say it again that Marc was a dedicated film shooter, even in his professional mode as a photographer.  Only recently did he use digital cameras, and then only for very specific jobs.  He had come to really love flying his DJI Phantom drone, and this past May, he took it out when we went on our last photo/lunch/thriftshop day trip.  We went out May 5, which was one of those bright sunny days with no clouds.  We visited a bunch of places, and finally in the afternoon, visited a thrift shop in Chelsea, where he bought a LOMO LC-A camera for less than $5!Drone Pilot, May 2018Marc's drone at Pickerel LakeMarc, atypical pose. May 5, 2018.We both looked forward to attending Photostock, which is a yearly event held in late June by Bill Schwab, near Harbor Springs, MI.  We didn't always attend, but we made many of them over the past decade.  It's a great gathering of photographers - mostly film and alt-process users, but nobody is a stranger to digital, either.  People leave their egos at the door, and we talk a lot, show our work, and do some photography.  Oh, yes, and we party at night, too. We both met some fantastic people at Photostock.Marc at Photostock 2008Marc and I traveled together a lot at Photostock.  I think 2013 was my favorite year, because we also did a UP photo trip afterwards.  We saw a lot together, and always came away with some good images and memories.  At a later Photostock Another trip to the UP was in late October 2012.  We drove Jorie's Jeep up to Marquette after I had some work done on it in Arbor. We switched out with my Ford Escape, and then drove it to some spots in Alger County that were definitely worth the trip.  Marc used to tell me that I drove like an old man. That's because I didn't have his lead foot on the gas. We did some great photography on that trip and saw the places mosquito-free, especially at Mosquito Falls.Marc and his Contaflex, Deerton, MIAt Mosquito Falls areaAt Tannery Falls, near Munising.We definitely loaded up the SUV with our respective camera gear. However, Marc's Gitzo tripod and RB-67 bag ALWAYS took up the most space.  He had a separate bag for his Nikon gear and his Contaflex outfit.  I don't know that I saw many of those images from the Contaflex.  We went on a trip to the Ghost Forest at Sleeping Bear Dunes one year, and he carried that monster tripod and backpack across the sand and up the hills.  He was always in better physical shape than me.  We always had fun, though, and I don't think he and I ever had a cross word with one another in all those years.It's not every day that you meet a person that you immediately like. Marc was one of those people. He had a way of making one at ease, and could start a conversation with anyone.  In his various jobs, I will bet that his demeanor and honesty was a great asset to him.  He had been a freelance photographer for some time, and one of his biggest accounts was doing photography at Domino's Farms, and was still intending to finish up some work. He was what I call a once-in-a lifetime best friend.  I wish we had both been able to live out to a decent old age, and I will miss his graciousness, his sense of humor, and wry smile.   I know that he made me a better photographer and a more outgoing person.   November, 2017street shooting in Holly, MI, 2011At Photostock 20082008 Crappy camera meeting2008-2009Marc will be missed by so many people. I know his wife Coleen and daughter Camille will miss him most of all. He was a proud father, good husband, and wonderful brother to his siblings.  I know that he made me a better person, and I will always be thinking of him when I venture out on a photo trip. Marc, you may not be with us now, but your spirit lives on in how you touched our lives, and so our lives must go on. I'll be thinking of you when I see the night sky and the water over the falls. Rest in peace, my friend.08/06/2018 --PLEASE NOTE: A Celebration of Life event will be held on Sunday, August 26, at 11:00 a.m. – 3:30 p.m., at Domino's Farms Office Park, EBA Café, Lobby H, Level 1, 24 Frank Lloyd Wright Dr., Ann Arbor, MI 48105. There will be an Open House at 11:00 a.m., a Remembrance Service starting at 11:30 a.m., with a luncheon to follow, and plenty of desserts.Memorial donations in memory of Marc may be made to the Huron River Watershed Council. https://www.hrwc.org/donate/someonespecial/"},
{"title": "Ultrafine Xtreme 400 -  A best buy in bulk film", "date": "Sunday, June 17, 2018", "text": "I have been a customer of Ultrafine Online for well over 15 years.  I'm a frugal person, and I appreciate saving money on my film expenditures, so long as the film is providing me with reliably consistent results.  Ultrafine, also known as Photo Warehouse (which is how their print catalogs are labeled), has been an excellent source for all types of films and photographic papers.  I recently spooled up some cassettes from a bulk roll of their Ultrafine Xtreme 400 b&w film, and realized that while I have reviewed some of their oddball film offerings, I have not reviewed what I feel is one of the greatest buys in conventional b&w films - Ultrafine Xtreme 400!From the Photo Warehouse site:\"Xtreme 400 is a high speed, medium contrast film allowing for exceptional utilization in action and sports photography and also an outstanding selection for general purpose photography. With a standard rating of ISO 400, it provides negatives exhibiting incredible sharpness and yet retains a fine grain under a myriad of lighting conditions. Xtreme 400 was designed to react vigorously to push processing and film speeds up to EI 1600/33 are easily achievable with X-tol type developers, maintaining nice shadow detail and perfectly scaled mid-tones, while still maintaining grain structure.\"The film has a very good representation in the Massive Development Chart, meaning it's likely that you will find your choice of developer for this film.Now I have only shot this film at the box speed, and in a recent trip to Oregon, I shot a few rolls in my Yashica FX-7 and Olympus Trip 35.A few examples  from the Trip 35 developed in D-76 1:1 for 14 minutes-Portland Art MuseumCannon Beachdowntown Portlanddowntown PortlandFrom the Yashica FX-7, all from downtown Portland, developed in Rodinal 1:25 for 7.5 minutes:More Portland images from the FX-7, but developed in D76 1:1 for 14 minutes:I am really pleased with the results thus far.  My only complaint is that the bulk roll did not come on a core, and I don't know if that will be a problem or not.  I like the fine grain, and the above images required very little tweaking in the scans.  Another nice feature - the film lies absolutely flat in the scanner film holder.  There is no cupping or curling.  Another nice feature -- a roll of 100 feet is $35 US.  Ultrafine Xtreme 400 is an excellent 400 ISO film that can be pushed to 1600 (which I need to try) at this price is quite amazing.  If you don't want to roll your own, you can also buy it in 12, 24, and 36 exposure rolls at about half the price of a roll of Tri-X.   I'll try processing my next roll in the FPP Super Monobath and see how it goes.  I'm not going to guess who supplies the film stock.  The rebate has Ultrafine Xtreme 400 printed on it.  I'm happy with it, and it doesn't really matter who originally made it -- Photo Warehouse has been selling it for a few years, and it's a great film to shoot with.  UPDATE - 06/25/2018I demonstrated the FPP Super Monobath at Photostock 2018 on 06/23.  I shot a couple of rolls in less than an hour with my Nikon F3HP in Harbor Springs. It happened to be a rainy day and the Farmer's Market was taking place in town.  I used one of the rolls in my demo and it came out great.  The standard 3.5 minutes at 74F.  Here are a few scans of the negatives:"},
{"title": "Mano a Mono- Developing film in the FPP Monobath ", "date": "Wednesday, June 13, 2018", "text": "To be honest, I have been known to dismiss the use of a monobath for developing film.  I was skeptical of such processes, as if they were some sort of alchemy.  The idea of develop and fix in ONE bottle was blasphemy to my ears.  You might as well have tried to convince me that you were transmuting lead into gold.   Of course, I am exaggerating my skepticism, but I certainly needed to be convinced that it was worth trying.What is a monobath anyway?  - Simply put, it is a solution containing a developer and fixer for b&w film.  Hold on there a bit. Yes, it can also be a color process as well.  If you ever shot a Polaroid or an Instax image, it's essentially a monobath process to develop the film. There is no multi-step process like conventional C-41 or E-6 film. Otherwise, yes, it's magic. B&W films also typically use a 3-step process, with different times for various films and developers. With a monobath, it's just one time for all b&w films.How does it work?  Magic?  No, of course, not.  What happens is that the developer is aggressive, and the fixer takes a while to kick in, which by that time, the developer has mostly done its job. Because of this dynamic, several things may happen depending on the film and the exposure.  1 - there may be reduced contrast 2 - there may be a loss of shadow detail 3. there may be increased contrast  4 - some films may need additional fixing 5 - some monobaths may cause excessive grain, raise the film speed, or cause fog. Different monobath formulas have their own peculiarities and effects on any single type of film. Monobaths are often used at higher than 20°C.FPP Super Monobath from the FPP site.Monobaths have been around since the late 1800s, and were popular in the 1950s and 60s with photojournalists. Quick results meant the image got to the editor sooner. Polaroid's b&w film used a monobath, making photography truly instant.  However,  modern monobath formulations date to about 1974, when G.W. Crawley published a recipe in the British Journal of Photography.  You can easily search for the recipe and its variants, as there are a few.  Some of the monobaths were created specifically for certain film types.  More recently, Donald Qualls came out in 2004 with a monobath recipe that just uses HC110, ammonia, and fixer concentrate. If you want to mix your own, you can easily find the formulas online.  However, most people would rather purchase a product that is ready to use.  It avoids having to find and mix the different chemicals, and is also more convenient.Earlier this year, the Film Photography Project store started carrying its own monobath.  The FPP Super Monobath comes in a 1 liter bottle, already mixed.  What's more, using it is pretty simple - 3.5 minutes at 24 degrees C.  That's it.  Each liter bottle can develop 10 to 15 rolls of film. After talking with Leslie, Mat, and Mike, I was convinced to try some and have been trying it out on different films.FPP 200 film, in the FPP Studio, Nikon N2020 :The FPP 200 film had excellent results with the FPP Super MonobathNow, a few examples from Svema 200, with a Yashica ME-1:The Svema 200 scanned pretty well, and I like the punchy results.Now, an oddball film - Orwo NP-55, a 64 ISO old-stock film (Leica R4, 35-70 lens):While I felt that the NP-55 negatives looked a bit \"thin\", they scanned in quite well.  Overall, quite happy with my results!My workflow with the FPP Super Monobath is quite simple, as are the items that you need to proces a roll of film.You need: a thermometer, developing tank, Monobath, FPP Archival Wash, water, and a changing bag if you don't have a darkroom.  Why the Archival wash?  It makes the rinsing go much faster, and you'll get the fixer residue completely removed.  Also, some Kodak Photoflo is a good idea for a final rinse to avoid streaks on the film when drying.I load the film in a Jobo reel and tank because the reels are easy to load for 35mm.  I bring my monobath up to 24°C in a water bath, and  I prewash the film for a minute before adding the monobath.  I pour out the prewash and pour in the monobath.  I agitate for the first 10 sec and then three inversions every 30 sec.  After 3.5 min have elapsed, I pour the monobath back into the bottle. I pour water into the tank and rinse for 30 sec.  I then pour in the Archival Wash and discard after 1 minute, followed by another 1 minute water rinse. A final bath in water with Photoflo for 30 sec and I can take the film off the reel to hang dry. Basically, it takes about 5-10 minutes to develop a roll and hang it to dry.My results have been quite satisfactory for most of the films that I have tried.  Others have had great results with the typical b&w films from Kodak and Ilford.You may wonder why use a monobath?  While I have my favorite developers, the FPP Super Monobath is just the thing when I want to test out a camera.  Its simplicity of use makes it an ideal candidate for developing on the road, as you don't have to mix anything.  I'll be trying it out on a road trip later this year!"},
{"title": "Book Review: Between Gravity and What Cheer, Iowa Photographs.", "date": "Tuesday, June 05, 2018", "text": "I have long been a fan of traveling around and photographing small towns, and I recently received a new book to review from the University of Iowa Press - Between Gravity and What Cheer. Iowa Photographs by Barry Phipps.  If the title sounds a bit odd, it's because those are the names of small towns in Iowa.   The author relocated to Iowa City from Chicago in 2012, and it's safe to say that the places are quite different.  However, the author began taking day trips across his new state, and in the process, documented the places he visited, in all of the 99 counties of Iowa.  This isn't a travelogue, nor is it an attempt to put the best face on the places he visited.  Barry Phipps' keen eye and choice of using color photographs (for the most part) has resulted in a beautiful and delightful collection of photographs that bring some aspect of each place into our view.  At times, I see echoes of Walker Evans, William Christenberry, Stephen Shore, and William Eggleston. This of course, is unavoidable, and is a compliment to the photographer. Barry Phipps doesn't present the often declining towns in a condescending way, but finds the beauty, the humor, or the strength of the places he visited. Along the way, he also photographed some of the people he met, and the portraits definitely add another dimension to the the richness of the images.  The compositions are excellent and colors are vibrant.  My only quibble is the use of monochrome images on pages 72 and 99 in an otherwise all-color presentation. In preparing a book such as this, one obviously has to make the decision \"what photo do I use?\" If one were simply photographing post offices, town halls, or such, it would be easier.  However, to pick an image (and to make an image!) to represent some facet of a town or county without it becoming repetitive or cliché takes a good eye, serendipity, and the ability to see beyond the obvious.  Small towns in the mid-west are generally not what they were 100 or even 50 years ago.  As large factory farms have replaced the family farm, passenger trains eliminated, local business decimated, and small manufacturing companies lost, many small towns have had a hard time.  It would be unfair to always show the worst, when every place has some interesting aspect, and I think the photographer has done an excellent job in balancing such aspects in his travels.  A photograph may well make you ask questions or make you want to visit.  As a photographer of small-town post offices, I really enjoyed the image of the Gravity post office.  Anyone that has visited a lot of small towns will find resonance with this book, and perhaps it will inspire you to explore your own state or county, and to find something that makes each place memorable.The author states \"The rivers and lines that form the boundary of this state are arbitrary. Nothing changes much in terms of culture or scenery as these lines are crossed, at least not at first. I try to find what is unique to each place. Iowa has all of the things that are in these photographs and not in these photographs, in these moments, these conditions.\"  I think that is a great statement, and Barry Phipps has provided us with colorful and engaging vignettes of Iowa. Definitely a recommended photography book, and it's all the more appreciated that he shot it on film.The book Between Gravity and What Cheer. Iowa Photographs is 112 pages, 9x9 inches, and is in soft cover at $29.95.  ISBN 978-1-60938-579-8. Published May 1, 2018 by the University of Iowa Press, Iowa City, IA."},
{"title": "Back from Portland, with lots of film.", "date": "Friday, June 01, 2018", "text": "Looking E into Portland from Washington Park. That's Mt. Hood in the background.Earlier this week, I returned from a week in Portland, Oregon.  It was a fantastic trip, and I am still mentally processing the trip, and have yet to start processing my film.  We flew there and back  on Alaska Airlines, which I had not flown on before, and I was pleased with the service and had absolutely no problems at any time.  I had my film in my carry-on bags, and did not bother with hand-checking at TSA.I previously listed what I was bringing, and I used all of the gear that I brought, though I used the Holga and the Sprocket Rocket very little.  Aside from shooting 20+ rolls, I also shot about 600 images with the Nikon Coolpix S600 and my iPhone SE.   I'll put a few of those in this post.A few things that really struck me in Portland:1. Light rail and streetcars make getting around very easy.  Five dollars gets you an all-day pass, which is really cheap.  I did have a rental car for traveling outside the city, and put 800 miles on it. Except for visiting Blue Moon camera and Machine, I didn't drive to any spots within the city, as I walked or took the rail.2. It's an easy city to navigate on foot. Watch out for the bike lanes and street cars!3. There are lots of bridges and elevated highways which make for great subjects.4. Lots of photography stores are there, and there is probably nothing that you cannot find locally.5. While the Pacific NW has a wet-and cloudy reputation -- it was almost always sunny while we were there. However, bring a light jacket or windbreaker if you go west to the Pacific beaches. You'll get chilled if you don't.6. Lots of bars, lots of food.  You won't be thirsty or hungry. Food trucks are everywhere!7.  Check out Blue Moon Camera and Machine, 8417 N. Lombard Street - analog only, and what a place to visit!Inside Blue Moon Camera8. The trees grow very tall and straight.  Make time for some trips to the coast as well as the Columbia River Gorge. Lots to see within a 2-hour radius!9. Visit Powell's bookstore.  THOUSANDS of photography books.  They will ship to your address, too.10. There are many fountains and parks in the city that will surprise you.I also made a trip to Tokeland, WA  to meet up with Marcy Merrill. She's a great photographer and has been operating the Junk Store Cameras website for about 20 years. I'll report on that later.  After I get through my film, I'll post some specific sets of topics here.Ira Keller Fountain is stunning.Visit Multnomah Falls if you can!"},
{"title": "Readying for Portland", "date": "Saturday, May 19, 2018", "text": "I am looking forward to going to Portland, Oregon for a week.  The Pacific NW is one area of the USA that I have not yet visited, and I have been doing my research for the trip.  While Portland is known for the rain, the weather outlook is mostly sunny all week, which has its merits, for sure.  Of course, I am packing my Tamrac camera backpack (I purchased it at Central camera in Chicago about 16 years ago) with gear for the trip.  I am bringing my Nikon N80 because it's a lot lighter than my F100. Lenses -- 50mm Nikkor, 20mm Nikkor, and 24-120 Nikkor.  The 20mm lens is fantastic, and of course, the 24-120mm is a very good all-around travel lens.  It has served me well over the years.I may also pack my Tamron 90mm macro lens, depending on how well it all fits.   I debated on also bringing a manual Nikon FE or FG, and decided instead to bring the Yashica FX-7 Super because it's light, works great, and is a pretty nice walk-about camera with good glass.  Having used it a lot over the past month, I am pleased with how it handles and just feels right. It's most likely to be used walking around the city, and filled with b&w film.  We'll be renting a car, so of course the Oregon coast is a sure trip, as well as the Columbia River gorge, etc.I'll be packing my new Manfrotto \"BeFree\" travel tripod in my checked bag, and after having tried it out a few times locally, I know it will be an excellent camera support.  I am also bringing a Holga, Lomo Sprocket Rocket, and the venerable Olympus Trip 35.  All are cameras that I know will give me something different.As far as film goes, 10 rolls of Fuji Provia 100,  lots of Kodak TMax 400, Ilford HP-5+, and some C-41 and specialty films such as FPP Infrachrome and Mr. Brown.  I know I'll be seeing lots of waterfalls, and Mr. Brown will be just the thing for those long exposures.Other items - lens cleaning cloth, cable release (which the N80 accepts), quick-release plates, notebooks, some short pieces of gaffer tape, various filters, including a graduated ND filter, and business cards all go into the pack.  An empty collapsed small camera bag will go into my checked luggage for when I am just doing things in the city and don't need to carry the backpack.I thought about just bringing my Nikon D300 and a few lenses, but the APS-C sensor won't give me the benefit  of the 20mm f/2.8 Nikkor.  Just in case, I am bringing a Nikon Coolpix S600 which fits into a pocket. While my iPhone SE does a pretty good job with snaps, the little digicam has a better range of focal lengths.Onward!"},
{"title": "One Roll Review -- JCH Street Pan 400", "date": "Wednesday, May 16, 2018", "text": "Japan Camera Hunter -- one of the most followed film photography accounts on Instagram, and the source of much GAS from his followers, piqued even more interest in 2016 when he released JCH Street Pan, a ISO 400 b&w film.  I have followed  Bellamy Hunt, aka Japan Camera Hunter, before there was Instagram.  His images of cameras  and photographers in Japan are often pure camera porn, usually with an emphasis on high-end desirable cameras.  In March 2016, Bellamy announced Japan Camera Hunter Street Pan, and of course, I was curious about it.  It was available in limited quantities later that year.  However, with so many different films coming out,  it has only been very recently that I ordered a couple of rolls for $8.49 each from B&H.  Unlike other  films that are currently available, this is a formulation made for JCH and no other seller.To quote from the JCH site:\"Now, I couldn’t have a completely new emulsion made, so I decided to go with an old discontinued surveillance film that was original made by AGFA, and have it put back into production. And thus JCH StreetPan was born! So this is a re-born film, not a re-spooled film that is still being sold. This is also not an ‘old stock’ film or a ‘pancake’ that was kicking around a ‘dusty warehouse’. This is a freshly produced emulsion with an expiry date of 2020. The film was no longer being produced and I had it put back into production. And for the record, this is not re-spooled Rollei Retro 400s.\"The attractive and distinctive red packaging makes this film stand out before you even load it into the camera.  JCH describes the film as \"contrasty and full of character\" and as being the \"optimum film for dawn, dusk and winter photography.\"Do a search for images shot with this film and you'll get the idea.  I am intrigued by its extra red sensitivity, and low grain, and the fact that it's on a polyester (mylar) base, which means very flat in the camera and very flat in the scanner!I loaded a roll into my trusty Nikon FE with a 28-85mm Nikkor lens and shot the roll over the course of 2 days.  We have had a run of overcast and wet weather, so I figured it would be a good test for the film.  I shot it at the box speed of 400 ISO and developed it in XTOL 1:1 for 17 minutes.It's sometimes difficult to evaluate a film based on one roll, and this is one of those times.  The film scanned beautifully on my Epson V700 scanner.  I am sure that most of the users of this film do a hybrid process - shoot film, scan digitally.  I have heard that taming the contrast may take some trial and error, and I can see that in some of my negatives.Here are some samples, all taken on May 15, in Ann Arbor, MI.It seems to me that the shadows are dark in many of  the images.   After reviewing my images, I think maybe setting the ISO to 200 may be a good idea for overcast days.  Having said that, I like the film, and the unique look that it gives.  It is contrasty, and gives a mood that you may find enjoyable. I'll try D-76 next time, and see if that makes any difference in the results.  The Massive Development Chart has the developer information for JCH Street Pan.This one time when a single roll test isn't enough, but I am pleased to have a film that offers something different.  For the most part, I like my results, and look forward to shooting more."},
{"title": "40 years ago today", "date": "Sunday, May 13, 2018", "text": "It's my 40th wedding anniversary. My wife Adrienne and I were still in college at SUNY-ESF in Syracuse. We married at 21 in Amenia, NY, her hometown. The reception was in the Amenia firehall, and it was a small (by today's standards) reception of less than 40 people.  Forty years later, we are still married, with many more years ahead.  I scanned in some 35mm slides last night and thought about the technology changes since 1978, and the fact that the same camera could do the same job today.  The film was Kodak Ektachrome. Adrienne's cousin, Chris Murphy was the photographer, and I think used a Pentax SLR. The slides are still easily viewed.  Imagine trying to find a digital file 40 years later.  You won't.  The physicality of a transparency or a negative is a quality that defines their existence, long after the event took place.  The beauty of photography is that it records memories better than our brains can fix them.  The sad reality that there is going to be a dearth of surviving images from 2002 onward, due to the digital avalanche.  Families record things on cellphones and rarely, if ever, make prints.  Phone goes dead, bye-bye-images, unless you have them backed up somewhere.  The other big difference, is that at our wedding there was one photographer, not 40 wannabe photographers with cell phones. The guests were enjoying the moment, not immersed in a cell-phone (which obviously didn't yet exist).  The great thing is that the Ektachrome slides have lasted as long as our marriage, and I have hopes that at 50 years, they will still be as vibrant as our marriage.Also happy Mother's Day to Adrienne.  Our daughter Marjorie is 30 years old."},
{"title": "The Olympus 35RC - Nearly Perfect Compact 35mm", "date": "Saturday, May 12, 2018", "text": "The Olympus 35RCThis camera certainly hails as one of the gems of 35mm compact rangefinder cameras.  The 35RC has larger siblings with more features, such as the 35RD and 35SP, but the 35RC is the model that you are most likely to run across.  The compact form of this camera does not equate to a lack of features.  Instead, what you have is a small camera that can be taken anywhere and allow you to reliably take photos without a lot of fiddling about.First appearing in 1970, the Olympus 35RC is a shutter-priority auto-exposure rangefinder camera that has manual over-ride. The shutter speeds range from B, 1/15-1/500 sec. The lens is a 42mm f/2.8 Zuiko lens that focuses from 3 feet to infinity. While the camera's dimensions of 4.5\" L x 2.8\"H x 2\"D is pretty small, the all-metal body has a weight of about 15 ounces. The top-mounted shutter speed dial is easy to use, and has enough settings for most uses.  Having a B setting is especially useful for night photography.  The only oddball thing is that the front filter ring is 43.5mm!  If you can find a step-up ring that would allow the use of a 46mm filter, the ability to mount various filters would be a nice benefit. I used to have the slip-on lens hood, but lost it somewhere.However, as-is, the 35RC is capable of taking sharp, crisp images with its excellent glass.  All of the controls seem precise.  According the excellent Camera Quest site, the Olympus 35RC is probably the smallest 35mm RF camera with auto-exposure (AE) and manual override.  Both shutter speed and aperture are visible in the viewfinder.  My 35RC's viewfinder has the shutter speed stuck a 1/15 sec, no matter what the setting, but AE works fine at any shutter speed that's set on the top dial. On AE, the shutter will lock if the light is too dim or too bright for the metering range (EV 7-18).  The minimum aperture of f/22 allows faster film to be used at slower shutter speeds.  The ISO range is 25-800, which is pretty much what anyone would need.  Of course, this is a 1970's camera, so no DX-coding is used.  The off switch on the camera's barrel is an excellent feature that saves battery juice and locks the shutter as well. There is automatic flash exposure via the use of Guide Numbers.  That is a great feature that I have only previously seen on the Canon QL-17. In use, you set the Guide Number (GN) to that of the flash, and as you focus, the camera will auto set the aperture, which provides good control of the flash exposure.  Any manual flash can be used. The hot shoe allows flash sync at all shutter speeds - try that with your SLR!Some Caveats -- While the Olympus 35RC originally took a Mercury PX625, you can elect to use a Wein Cell, a hearing-aid battery, or just go with an LR-44 button cell with 1.5V.  If you are using b&w or C-41 film, the exposure difference usually will not matter.  Or, go with a MR-9 Mercury Cell adapter   Note that there are other adapters online with the same name, but do not have the microcircuitry that the Criscam adapter has. The fakes only allow the use of hearing aid cells, not silver-oxide cells.  I have used my 35RC with LR-44 cells and I cannot complain about the exposures.The manual override does not use the meter - but if your meter is working, you can easily use that for a guide, or just go with sunny-16 if you wish.There has been some doubt that the 35RC's top shutter speed is actually 1/500 sec, due to it being only a 2-bladed shutter.  My Phochron XA shutter tester gave me the following readings on my camera:dial      actual1/15 - 1/14.31/30 -  1/29.71/60 -  1/60.21/125- 1/1241/250- 1/3031/500- 1/542 (varied  from 1/530-1/566)Not too bad, and certainly within the tolerance range. Of course, this is a 45+ year-old camera!Marc Akemann, 2009 at the Grand Rapids Art Museumon Ektar 100.In use, the camera feels precise, and the controls are easy to use.  The camera is small enough that I just used a wrist strap with it.  It fits easily into a jacket pocket, and of course, is a great travel companion.  I think the Olympus 35RC deserves more love. It's certainly a more usable camera than a Rollei 35, and if you can find the appropriate filters and a snap-on lens hood, you will be set for just about anything.  The 42mm focal length is not as wide as some compacts (38 being more common), but it is certainly close to a \"normal\" lens.  The compact nature of this camera and its simple, yet effective controls make it a classic in any book.  I have previously published posts on this camera, and this will probably be the last one I do on the 35RC, as it is going to the big online auction.  I am trimming down my cameras, and the ones that have been not getting much use lately are leaving."},
{"title": "Out and About with the Yashica ME1", "date": "Thursday, May 10, 2018", "text": "A funky little 35mm camera came my way recently, and one that I knew little about, at that.  A Yashica ME1 is an attractive little zone-focus camera manufactured in Japan in 1970 and Brazil, starting in 1977. My example was made in Brazil. What sets this little camera apart from other small 35s, is the clean design of the top plate, which features only a shutter button, hot shoe, and a frame counter.  The film advance wheel is on the lower rear L of the camera, and the film rewind is on the bottom right.  This is an all-black plastic camera that features the typical ASA setting dial around the lens with a CdS cell on the front lens plate.  The film speed settings range from an ISO of 25 to 500.  The 38mm f/2.8 lens is pretty much right there with a slew of other compact 35s that proliferated in the 70s and early 80s.  Like many other cameras of its time, it requires a Mercury PX635 cell to power the camera, but I popped in a LR44, and the camera sprang to life. With b&w and C-341 film, the exposure difference between the two battery voltages should not be a problem.  The shutter speeds range from a paltry 1/60 - 1/360 sec, and the shutter locks if you leave the lenscap on or do not have enough light (nice feature).  The exposure is all automatic, and you look in the viewfinder to see if the needle is in the \"green zone.\"  The self-timer (ca. 8 seconds) is in a typical spot to the right of the lens barrel.  Focus is indicated by the icons, 1m, 1.5m, 3m, and infinity, with feet and meters on the opposite side of the lens.In the hand, this camera feels very natural,and the bottom L-positioned thumb wheel film advance seems perfect for this little camera. You can wind on and shoot pretty quickly. While its specifications are quite ordinary, it is certainly capable of taking good photographs under typical conditions.  One feature that surprised me is the extra little window in the viewfinder that shows your distance setting and whether you will need to use the parallax correction markings in the bright viewfinder.  That is a nice feature, and the needle in the right side of the window indicates whether your exposure will be adequate.  The red zone means you'll require a flash, or the shutter locks up, unless you set the aperture manually, off the A position.from the manual via Butkus.orgI loaded a roll of Svema 200 b&w film, and shot a test roll last month.  I developed it in the new FPP Super Monobath for 3.5 min at 24°C.  The Svema film is a bit punchy - contrasty with some grain, but overall, the images look pretty good for basically a p&s 35mm camera.Elsewhere, I have seen the ME1 compared to the Minolta Hi-Matic G and the Olympus Trip 35, which is a fair comparison.  However, I would give the Hi-Matic a better overall score due to its more robust build. Same for the Trip 35, which is in a class by itself because it does not require batteries, and if you have one that works, you know that it is a great little camera. My example of the Yashica ME1 came with a dented filter ring, which is too bad.  It does take 46mm filters like many other small 35s in its class.  The Yashica ME1 is an attractive little camera, and its Brazilian manufacture makes it an unusual camera among 35mm cameras of the 1970s.   Prices on ebay for this camera range from $15-$55.Yashica produced over 40 different 35mm non-SLR models, and the Electro 35, Lynx and Minister series are usually the first ones that come to mind. Most are true rangefinder cameras, but a few are zone-focus.  The ME1 is a far different camera than the metal-bodied Electros, being more compact, but still having good Yashica glass.  It's not going to be the be-all compact 35, but it is easy to use, lightweight, and certainly affordable.  Unlike the much larger Electro series, it won't suffer from oddball battery requirements and bad electronics.  Certainly worth a try if you see one in a shop. If you need a manual, it hardly goes without saying that you'll find one at Jim Butkus' site."},
{"title": "Yashica Fun - The FX-7 Super", "date": "Thursday, April 26, 2018", "text": "It has been a while since I have shot with a Yashica SLR.   My experience with them to this point, was with the older M-42 screw-mount cameras, most notably the TL Electro X.I recently came into possession of a very nice and refurbished Yashica FX-7 Super.  I certainly wasn't looking to expand into the realm of Contax/Yashica mount cameras (C/Y), but this one looked so beautiful that I had to have it for a while and try it out.  After doing some online research, I discovered that the FX series of cameras were made by Chinon (who also made the Canon T-60, Nikon FM-10, and numerous other low-end 35mm SLRs).  This is after Kyocera took on the Yashica brand.  I used to own a (Kyocera) Contax G1 rangefinder, and while it had many attributes that I liked, it was slow with the AF, and the top LCD was exhibiting bleeding. However, the Zeiss Planar 45mm T* lens was excellent. With Kyocera taking on the Contax marque, they of course, released some very fine 35mm SLRs under the Contax name, all with lovely Zeiss T* lenses.  Meanwhile, the Yashica bodies, aimed for a lower price point, came with Yashica-branded lenses. Mine has Yashica ML 50mm f/2.  The beauty is that the two brands shared the same C/Y mount, meaning that a lightweight, inexpensive body could have a fine Planar T* lens on it. That is certainly one attraction for the FX bodies.My FX-7 Super has been recovered in dark blue leatherette by a previous owner, and new foam seals installed.  The camera is in excellent condition.  As a small SLR, it has the following features:Shutter speeds - B, 1 - 1/1000 sec.Flash Sync Speed - 1/125th secTop deck shutter release with threads for remoteSelf-timer [10 sec]Hot shoe with extra control contactmolded hand grip on right side+/- LEDs for exposure indication in viewfindermanual exposure mode onlyviewfinder with center focus spot - split-mage microprismrequires 2 LR-44 cells for meter onlyhalf-press of shutter release activates meterThrough-the-lens, full-aperture center weighted light metering with SPD cellISO range of 12-1600 set on shutter speed dial52mm filter thread on the lens with this body.tripod socket centered on the bottomThis is a fairly basic set of features, but in practical use, it's all you really need to take photos.  The camera body has no sharp edges, and it is nice to hold.  Its fairly quiet copal square vertical metal shutter sounds \"snappy\". The camera weighs just over a pound, and it really is a joy to use. There are lots of sites with information on the FX-3 and FX-7 series, and I am not going to repeat it all here.  One feature they all share is the discussion on the disintegration of the leatherette.  If you have one, you would be wise to recover it, and I have to say that the navy blue on mine is gorgeous.Shooting experienceThis is an all-manual SLR camera that is compact, precise in operation, and everything is located just right.  It makes a Pentax K1000 seem like a cloddish camera.  I have been carrying it around with me for a few weeks now, and it's definitely going places.  The 50mm f/2 lens is just fine, and maybe in the future I will acquire a Zeiss T* 50mm lens for it.  For now though, it's all I need. PhotosHere are a smattering of b&w images taken in NJ and MI, and I have to say that the camera works great.   I can recommend this camera to anyone looking for a manual SLR that is lightweight and of relatively recent manufacture (mid-1980s).   While the Yashica C/Y mount may not have as many lenses and accessories as the Nikon/Canon/Pentax/Olympus systems, you will find the lenses that you need for most types of shooting.  Aside from the Yashica and Contax brands, there are lenses from Tamron (Adaptall-2), Soligor, Sigma, and others that have the C/Y mount.Mat, hotel room, expired Plus-XMike's hula girl, expired Plus-Xhydrant, expired Plus-XMike Raso, expired Plus-X shadows on steps, Tasma NK-2Ann Arbor Subraru, Tasma NK-2Argo trestle, Tasma NK-2somewhere in Ohio on I80, in the rain, Tasma NK-2"},
{"title": "Tasma NK-2 Film Review", "date": "Wednesday, April 25, 2018", "text": "Over the past few years I have been able to sample the interesting films from the Film Photography Project store.  The Svema films such as the FN64 and Svema 400 are really nice films in my opinion, and I have been using them rather frequently.  One film that I have not tried until now is the Tasma NK-2 100 ISO b&w film.  I am not sure why I hadn't tried it earlier, but after shooting two rolls of it in the past week, I feel that I can offer a quick review.First of all, the Tasma film originates from Russia, and is described as a b&w motion picture film.  The Russian site says that the factory dates from 1933, so Tasma has a long history. The film is on a PET base, not acetate, and consequently is extremely tough and will not tear like an acetate-based film.  It's also thinner than typical 35mm films, much like the Svema stocks that I have used, but seems not as flimsy as the Svema.  The Tasma NK-2 film is fresh stuff, according to the FPP site, and has a sort of cult-status. The Tasma NK-2 rolls are in 24-exposure cassettes from the FPP, and are DX-coded.  I would prefer 36-exposure rolls, but then again, with these limited-availability films, the shorter rolls are a good idea, especially for testing.  The film loaded easily onto the take-up spool in the Nikon F3HP and the Yashica FX-7 cameras that I used.  I set the ISO on the cameras to the box speed of 100. DEVELOPINGI checked the Massive Development Chart, and the information on the Tasma NK-2 seemed rather odd, so I consulted the FPP pages on Flickr, and found two developers that I use: D-76 and XTOL.  Leslie Lazenby's recommendation was XTOL stock at 7.25 minutes.  Another photographer (Tom Napier) recommended D-76 straight for 7 minutes.   I find the MDC listing a bit odd, as I have only seen examples with people shooting it at box speed.Other developers and times that I have found (all at 20°C):HC-110 B for 10 minD76 Stock for 10 minDiafine - 4 min each in A & BI developed in D-76 for 10 minutes, and did a water stop, followed by 7 minutes in fixer.  I washed in water and used Permawash to remove any fixer followed by a good rinse.  Both rolls came out beautifully. The film dries perfectly flat, and scans beautifully on my Espon V700.Nikon F3HP with 19mm Vivitar lens:Yashica FX-7 Super with 50mm f/2 lens.Overall, the Tasma NK-2 is a very easy film to work with, especially now that I have a developer or two that I can use to get satisfactory results.  The tonality is certainly acceptable, and it is fine-grained.  I can see no reason why anyone would not want to try some.  The fact that it scans so well should be a key point in using it.  I think a bulk roll of it from the FPP store is next on my list."},
{"title": "A REVIEW: HOLGA - Photographs by Michael Kenna. ", "date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2018", "text": "I have long been a fan of Michael Kenna's photography. Many of  b&w photographs, often taken at dusk or dawn, possess dream-like qualities. Sometimes, the rich detail in the shadows invites us to linger over an image, so that we discern even more than we anticipated. With his array of landscapes, the often ethereal quality makes them timeless. His architecture-related images run counter to the notion that architecture photographs must be technically perfect. Instead, we are treated to a luscious world of tonality and keen observation of details.When I first saw an announcement of Kenna's latest book, HOLGA, with the image of the white dove on the cover, I knew that I had to have it. After some delay, the book finally shipped in early March of 2018. I was not disappointed with the content. I know that Kenna has primarily used Hasselblads for his work, but to find out that he has also been carrying along a Holga on his trips was a surprise. It is not a surprise that his Holga images are wonderful. The very qualities that make a Holga an unpredictable camera - simple lens, limited aperture adjustment, and only two shutter modes - Instant and Bulb, are used masterfully by Kenna. I suspect that many of the images were done in B mode on a tripod. You don't have to be a fan of the Holga to appreciate the images in this book. Kenna wields the Holga as well as he does his 'Blad, and the luscious photographs are his forte. He uses the attributes of the Holga to produce images that  are enchanting, evocative, and soulful. The printing is excellent, and the 7x7 inch images are perfectly sized to view properly.The old axiom, \"It's not the camera, but the photographer that wields it\" holds true here. Kenna's use of the Holga is indicative of his vision and his craft, and the book is a must-buy.HOLGA - Photographs by Michael Kenna.  151 pp. Prestel Verlag, Munich, London, New York. 2017.

{"title": "ONE-ROLL REVIEW - Kosmo Foto Mono", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2018", "text": "One of the recent developments in the film world has been the sale of  \"boutique\" films, such as the JCH Pan.  Another brand, Kosmo Foto, has released a B&W film called Kosmo Foto Mono, an ISO 100 film.  I recently received a roll of this film, and had the opportunity to try it out.  First of all, you should know that only a few factories are actually producing film, and some of them have been very happy to repackage film for sale under a different name.  Lomography doesn't make their own film, but rebrands film made by Kodak, Fuji, etc.  In the case of Kosmo Foto, it's the Foma company in the Czech republic.  The film is Fomapan 100, and in the case of Kosmo Foto, it is the coolest film box I have seen. I shot the roll of film in my Nikon N2020 (see previous review of the camera) while on a trip in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in late March. I processed it at home in XTOL (straight) for 6 minutes. I don't recall previously shooting any Fomapan 100 (unless it was an Arista brand), but I am pleased with the results that I got. Nice tones, good shadow detail, and the highlights are good.  I was also pleased to see that the film lies PERFECTLY FLAT in the scanner holder. No curling or cupping.  Right away, I am a fan.I will post a few photos below to show my results.  Crisp is how I would describe the images. All were scanned on my Epson V700 scanner.At this point, you may wonder why I just didn't order Fomapan 100 and shoot it. I like the idea of these branded films -- whether it's Japan Camera Hunter Street Pan, Kosmo Foto Mono, or Lomography's Lady Grey, etc.  It gets people buying the film, and more film sales keep the plants churning out product.  More product, more choices, more film. Sure, you can just go buy the Fomapan 100 for less than $5/36 exp. roll from Freestyle and get the same results as buying the Kosmo Foto Mono.  However, by purchasing the Kosmo Foto film, you are helping out an enthusiast, too.  The point is, Stephen Dowling, the Kosmo Foto man himself, really likes the Fomapan 100 emulsion -- so much so, that is why he went to all the trouble to create the packaging and rebranding.  There will be lots of people that never would have tried the Fomapan 100, but are willing to buy into the buzz about the Kosmo Foto film.  It's all good. Other reviews of the Kosmo Foto MonoDown the Road by Jim GreyEmulsive ReviewClassic Camera Revival"},
{"title": "Nikon took AF Mainstream - the N2020 SLR", "date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2018", "text": "The 1980s was a decade of major change in the camera industry. Auto-focus was becoming a factor in the direction of new cameras, and while the Konica C35AF was the first AF point and shoot in 1977, SLR manufacturers were testing the AF waters with kludgy AF lenses attached to manual focus cameras. For those, we had the Nikon F3AF, The Canon T80, and the Pentax ME F with the SMC Pentax-AF 35-70/2.8 KF-mount lens.  In short, they were all dead-ends, because the focus motor was inside the lens, along with the batteries to power it.  It was not until 1985 that SLR manufacturers took AF seriously on advanced and pro-level SLR cameras when Minolta produced the Maxxum 7000 as a complete system camera with the focus motor inside the camera, along with the full control of the lenses on the body. Canon came out with the EOS system in 1987, Pentax brought out the SF-1 in 1987, and it was the first AF SLR with a built-in flash.  Nikon brought out the N2020 in 1986, which aside from the AF features, was nearly identical to the manual-focus N2000 that was released in 1985. While very similar to the popular N2000, the N2020 (F-501 in Europe) features the lens motor in the body, with the ability to use nearly all AI and AIS manual lenses, as well as AF and AF-D lenses.  This was accomplished without changing the lens-mount (as did Pentax), unlike Minolta and Canon, which created new mounts for their AF cameras that were not backwards-compatible with their manual predecessors.While Nikon kept producing the manual-focus F3HP (until 2001) and the FM2N (until 1997) (followed by the FM3A 2001-2006), the switch to an AF pro-level body, the F4, did not take place until 1988.  In the meantime, Nikon produced a series of mostly forgettable AF cameras (N4004, N6006), until in 1988, the N8008 was also introduced. However, the N2020 stands out as a particular bit of genius because it looks like a manual-focus camera with the typical dials and controls one expects from an analog camera. Yet, the inclusion of the lens motor makes this first AF-SLR body from Nikon quite noteworthy.I have previously owned a Nikon N2000 body, and found it to be a very capable SLR with great metering, easy-to-use controls, and with very good ergonomics.  The off-center tripod mount (rectified by attaching an AH-3 bottom plate adapter) was the only quirky bit, because of the AAA batteries in the bottom of the camera. The N2020 is exactly the same in that regard, but with the added AF-L, and M-C-S focus controls. The N2000/N2020 use an automatic film advance and a manual rewind knob, and were the first Nikon SLRs with polycarbonate bodies. What I find particularly nice about the N2020 is that it uses manual lenses without feeling awkward.  The green focus assist light works with manual lenses, and since there is no split-screen focus, that is useful. Because it was designed to use lenses with manual aperture control, it will not work with G-lenses (still not my favorite).  The camera does have three different P modes, but I confess that I have not used them.  I am basically an Aperture-Priority and Manual mode kind of guy.  The N2020 has a max shutter speed of 1/2000 sec, and ISO ranges of 12-3200.  Exposure compensation is available for +/- 2 stops in 1/3 stop increments.  DX-coded cassettes can be used (setting the ISO wheel at DX), or the ISO can be set manually.The N2020's AF is a bit slow by today's standards, with only a central AF point.  In dim light, it may be faster to use manual focus.  However, I found that for most subjects, the AF is fast enough for my use.  It certainly is no slouch when using manual focus lenses, and in that regard, it's a perfect camera to learn with.  All of the controls are there for full manual operation, and the only auto-anything is the film advance.  If you want to use a remote release, you'll need to find an MC-12A release that attaches to the front left of the camera, as a standard threaded cable release is not included.  The viewfinder is not too bad, with 93% coverage.  You can use Nikon dedicated TTL flashes in full auto-mode with a shutter speed of 1/125 sec.  The perfect matching flash would be the SB-16 or SB-20.The camera is now 32 years old, and certainly newer than the myriad of Nikon FMs and FEs in circulation.  I see it as a classic camera in a special category - Nikon's first AF SLR body. It has classic styling and is a robust camera. Whether you opt for the N2000 or the N2020, you will have the same controls, but the N2020 has the advantage of using both MF and AF lenses, and in that, I feel the N2020 is the superior camera. NIKON AF!"},
{"title": "Agfa Isola I Review", "date": "Wednesday, March 14, 2018", "text": "Last fall I picked up an Agfa Isola I at a thrift shop for a few bucks.  I suspect the price was low because the staff didn't know that to make the shutter fire, you have to telescope the lens away from the body.  It was in a brown leatherette case, and while I had hopes for a more advanced 120 camera, the Isola I was a new one for me, so I picked it up. Agfa manufactured these cameras from the 1956 into the early-60s, and produced three Isola models - Isola, Isola I, and Isola II.  If you are  looking for any particular one, get the Isola II, which I'll explain a bit later on.  The original Isola and Isola II have the same features, that is, B, 1/30, and 1/100 shutter speeds. All Agfa Isola models feature a telescoping lens tube, which when fully extended from the body, click in place to allow the shutter to function. That's important, and otherwise the camera will seem inoperable.  Also, the shutter has double-exposure prevention, as the film takeup knob needs to wind on a bit for the shutter to re-engage. There is a tiny red window by the shutter button to show that it has been fired.The Isola I has two shutter settings - I and B - instant is ca. 1/35 sec, and B is obviously however long you want to hold it open.  The 1/35 speed is the Achilles heel of this camera.  Knowing this, I loaded a roll of Ilford Pan-F (nominal ISO 50) to try it out.  The sunny and cloudy aperture settings are ca. f/11 for sunny, and f/6.5 for cloudy, and a third setting provides a yellow filter which would be fine for b&w film on a sunny day using ISO 100 film.   If you wish to use any faster films, you will need to tape a neutral-density gel over the lens. I took the camera to Chelsea, MI to try it out, and shot a roll in an hour or so, testing out the distance scale and the aperture settings.  I finally got around to developing the film this week, and I have to say that overall, I am pleased with the results.Using the camera is fairly simple, and like most roll-film cameras, there is a red window on the back to see what frame you are on. It takes 120 film, so no 620 fuggery is necessary.  There is a PC cord socket to enable the use of a flash, should you want to.  I did not try using one.For me, the most limiting factor of the Isola I is the 1/35 sec shutter speed.  Even the most basic box cameras have a shutter speed closer to 1/60 sec.  Other than that, it's a pretty straightforward budget box-type camera that will provide results that would be expected from a camera in its class. You can get a manual for the Isola over at Butkus, of course. There is also a nice online presentation of using the Isola II over at UK Camera.  I recommend using low-ISO film for outdoor shooting, so Ilford Pan-F would be my first choice.  For indoors, you could use ISO 400 with a flash. Since the camera has a thread for using a cable release and a tripod socket, it certainly could be used for long-exposures, which I will have to try sometime.  Right now, I have a roll of 1992-expired color Ektar 25 loaded to see what I get from it."},
{"title": "Agfa Cinerex - Another Oddball Film", "date": "Thursday, March 08, 2018", "text": "I purchased a couple of rolls of Agfa Cinerex IC1N film from Ultrafine last year, and finally finished up a roll in my Nikon FE a few weeks ago. I had forgotten to put a slip of paper in the film reminder slot on the back,so all I knew was that I was shooting an ISO 50 film.  I hate it when I do that, but in this case, my subject was a good test for the film.First of all, what is Agfa Cinerex?  It's a fine-grained orthochromatic film (not red-sensitive) that was used in the medical industry as a cineradiography film.  There is no antihalation layer on the polyester base, so it's a good idea to load it in subdued light to avoid light-piping (which definitely shows on the sprocket area of the roll that I shot). It seems to have first become available online around 2012, as entries regarding the film appeared on Rangefinder Forum and APUG that year.  At that time, someone was selling 300 ft. rolls of it.There is a dearth of information online from the manufacturer. I'll say one thing about Kodak -- they published technical data for their films and made the pdfs available online.  Thankfully, Ultrafine Online has some basic developing information available, and the links to the forums are helpful. When I loaded the film back in September, I did a few shots around town and forgot to indicate the film on the camera. I picked up the Nikon FE last month, and shot some beautiful fog shots to finsih the roll.  I shot more fog on a roll of Svema FN-64, and I will compare them sometime.I developed the Cinerex film in XTOL 1:1 for 11 minutes at 20C, with my standard fixing time of 8 minutes.  The film dried quickly, and I scanned the negatives on my Epson V700.  There is a slight curl to the film, but it sat nicely in the 35mm filmstrip holders. See the light piping? Load in subdued light!It's an odd film, of course, and probably not well-suited for low-contrast images such as the fog scenes.  However, with sunny conditions, and even low-light, it performed pretty well. Lots of good contrasty results in full sun.  The fog scenes are very grainy, and yet are very interesting.  That's probably pushing the film to accomplish what other films do better, so my next roll will be shot in strong light, and maybe even with LED lighting, just to see what I get.Until recently, you could buy this unusual film in 36-exposure rolls from Ultrafine Online (also known as Photo Warehouse), but they are no longer selling it in 100-ft bulk rolls, and the individual rolls are listed as \"out of Stock\". That's too bad, because it's an interesting film. However, like I always say, \"If you are late to the party, don't complain about not getting cake.\"These all look pretty darn good As you might have guessed from many of my posts, I enjoy trying out strange films, especially if they are black and white.   While any film emulsion can be used for some sort of still photography, the challenge is often to see what a film is capable of doing well.  Sometimes the limiting factor is the low ISO of some cinema-specific films -- i.e., those used for making titles and special effects, or for copying to make positive masters.  With some films, it might be the spectral sensitivity that is a factor.  In some instances, we just have to wing it when it comes to the developing of the film.  With a large film user community, we end up having some good data on developing these films, and with sites like the Massive Development Chart, we have an easily-accessed knowledge base.  The gang at the Film Photography Project also have been providing us with some oddball films from Eastern Europe.  If you have been experimenting with any of these films, remember to share your successful results with the larger community.After adjusting brightness and contrast post-scan Almost looks like a pen and ink image."},

He explained the different photo processes in terms that anyone could understand, and I was impressed with the displays and amount of photo materials that were on exhibit.  The PAMoPH has about 2500 square feet is packed with images, tools, cameras and ephemera that are sure to interest anyone with an interest in the history of photography.    I was most interested in the cameras and ephemera from Kodak and Polaroid, and there was enough there to keep me busy for a few hours, if I could have stayed.   First of all, museums devoted to the techniques and tools of photography are few.  I know only of Eastman House in Rochester, NY and the Argus Museum in Ann Arbor, MI,  where anything significant about the history of photography and the hardware can be seen.  While in a relatively small space, the PAMoPH is full of historical gems, from Daguerreotypes to ambrotypes, albumin prints and lantern slides.  The exhibit cases are well-lit, enabling one to see the various images and cameras, etc.  There is also an exhibit downstairs that is titled Lincoln In Pittsburgh, which runs through the summer.  The museum is really strong in Civil War era photography and photos on glass, and the Pittsburgh area (which is why I donated the plates to them).How a view camera works.The PAMoPH is open Mondays and Wednesdays through Saturday, 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, and admission is $10.  You can call ahead to arrange a tour at 412-231-7881.    The museum is fund-raising to renovate another building with 25,000 sq. ft. of space which will allow them to expand their education and outreach, as well as improve the visitor experience.  I will definitely visit again the next time I am in Pittsburgh.  Thanks to Bruce Klein for his wonderful tour of the museum.loads of vintage Kodaks in all colors!Lots to see and digestNot many Argus cameras!"},
{"title": "Ferrania's P30 Film - A One Roll Review", "date": "Friday, February 23, 2018", "text": "I love shooting b&w film.  There are so many choices out there, and the various emulsions, whether old or new are worth exploring if you want to try them (and today, Kodak Alaris announced Tmax P3200 will be reintroduced!).I was one of the early Film Ferrania Kickstarter backers, and while I do hope they are able to bring their color E-6 film into production, I am far more likely to be shooting b&w film. Last year, Ferrania brought back an old emulsion, which they called P30 Alpha, and touted it as a traditional b&w film with high silver content, with an ISO of 80.  I didn't get any of the earlier rolls, but what I did see online piqued my curiosity.  So this year, when they let backers know that the P30 film was available for $5/roll, I jumped and purchased five, which arrived quite quickly.  Even with the $8 shipping, I think it is a bargain for five 36-exposure rolls.I brought one roll in my bag when I went to Toronto a few weeks ago, and shot it with my Minolta XG-M, one of my favorite and most reliable Minolta SLRs.  Most of it was shot while I was in the Distillery District with Bill Smith and Nancy Bueler -- my Toronto photo friends that took their time to show me around town. After I returned home, it was the first roll I developed, as I was curious to see if the hype about this film was valid.  I shot the film at ISO 80, and developed it in D-76 straight, for 7 minutes, as directed in the instructions.  As soon as I took the film off the reel and hung it to dry, I was pleased with what I was seeing.   It had been a snowy overcast day, and there was a lot of contrast in the scenes.  I scanned in the negatives on my Epson V700 scanner at 2400 dpi, and my initial response is WOW! I think this film has great tonal response, great mid-tones, very fine grain, and I am very pleased with the results.  I have yet to make traditional prints from the negatives, but the scans needed very little tweaking.   The film lies flat in the negative holder without any cupping like we see in Kodak's Tri-X. Here are some sample images from the roll.  I was not disappointed in any of them.  I am blown away when I look at the detail in the first image.  The Ferrania P30 film is a keeper, and I hope that they keep producing it."},

It was charming, but not exactly in the league with a Ricohflex.  The Halina 35 appeared in the early 1980s as a premium camera, often under other names, and with slight cosmetic changes.  Don't confuse this with the metal-bodied Halina 35mm cameras.  The model that I have is typical of a simple \"optical lens\" premium camera with few controls.  It looks better than it ought to, and I figured that I would test it with a roll of Kodak Vision 100T film from the Film Photography Podcast.   The shutter speed is about 1/100th sec, and with aperture control for sunny to cloudy and flash, I figured that would work out okay.  I shot the roll back in late summer-early fall, and it wasn't until last week that I finally processed the film at home with a home-brew ECN-2 kit that I got from August Kelm.  The Halina 35 is a simple camera, and I certainly expected my images to look like something from a Time  camera -- soft, and lacking in contrast.  However, after looking at the scans from the negatives, I am fairly impressed with the results.  I did have a few frames with double exposures, and I am not sure if it was my fault or the camera.  I'll try a roll of b&w and see if the problem is with the camera.Here are some of the best images from the camera that I shot on the Kodak Vision 100T film.double-exposurelight-pole flyersbricks with wordsnew hotel downtownold Muskegon train stationold Muskegon train stationfarm stuffNot too bad for a \"crappy camera.\""},

I made the mistake in 2003 of having way too many cameras on a trip to New Mexico.   It's one thing to bring some equipment that I didn't use because the conditions were wrong, such as a Lomo Sprocket Rocket and overcast rainy days.  So, what I am doing now is deciding in advance what my goals are and assembling gear around that.Last week I went to Toronto for 3 nights, and had arranged to meet up with Bill Smith and Nancy Beuler, both locals that are doing film photography, and who I have been friends with on FB and Flickr.  Of course, it's winter, so I was not going to be bringing any cameras that are fiddly to use. I decided to make it a Minolta event, and brought a Maxxum 5 (lightweight and AF), and a Minolta XG-M (aperture-priority manual), and a Minolta Hi-Matic G (point and shoot).  I brought a Maxxum QTsi as a backup, and a Yashica A TLR.  I also brought a tiny Canon Powershot SD1400, because nothing like having a tiny digi on hand anyway.It turns out that we had snowy and cold conditions on the first day, and cold and sunny on the second day.  We took street cars, walked a lot, and also took the subway.  I wasn't agonizing over which cameras to use, and while the Yashica A only took 3 photos, I am glad that I brought it.  I had a lot of fun, and while the conditions were not always the best, I think I came away with some good photographs.  I'll post them after I develop the film. Toronto is a very accessible city, and has great public transportation.  The streetcars are an efficient way to get about town, as is the very nice subway.  I know that I'll return when it is warmer, as there are many places to see and night photography awaits.I am going to Pittsburgh next weekend, and I am bringing just one camera bag with my Nikon F3HP and a couple of lenses, and my Olympus Trip35.  They are  well-tested cameras that I can depend on to give me great results.  At the last minute I may throw in a Holga.Onward!"},

It seems like January has 40 days, doesn't it?   The calendar assures that it is only 31, but I swear there is an extra week hidden in there.  Perhaps it is because we are so damn busy in December with holidays, parties, birthdays, etc. that January seems so long.  In any case, it's also one of those months that I find myself catching up with things that got put on the back burner, like developing film.  I have been working through developing and scanning a lot of rolls of C-41 film that I shot in the second half of 2017.  One new thing that has made my work go so much easier has been one of those immersion heaters for Sous Vide cooking.  I had seen them being used for C-41 and E-6 processing as heaters for water baths to bring the chems up to the proper temperature, and keep it there.  So, I ordered one online from Amazon for $68.00. It's a Sous Vide Immersion Stick Pod by Primo Eats, and it's an amazing device. Although designed for slow-cooking food, it makes a perfect water heater with thermostat control and a rotor that circulates the water.  The temperature range is 5-100° C, so having the water bath at 38.5°C is not a problem.  In fact, I could set it for 20°C for b&w processing, too.  This has saved me a lot of water -- I had been using hot water from the tap to heat up the chemistry; and has saved me lots of time, as well.  I can set everything up in the water bath, turn on the stick pod, and go off and do other things until the chemistry is up to the right temp.  The device heats up the water quite quickly, but of course, the chemistry in the bottles also has to be heated by the water circulating around them.  Once it's at the proper temperature, you can be sure that it will stay there while it is in the water bath. This will give you more control over your processing, for sure.Set the temp and let it heat up.I label my tanks with numbers that correspond to howmany rolls I have processed in a batch of chemistry. I usuallystop at 20 rolls.So far, so good.  The film has come out great, and I no longer worry about whether the temperature has changed. I also put the developing tank in the water bath in between rotations, just to make sure it is staying where it should be.And here are a few shots from my Pentax K1000 and Lomo 400 color film, from last May-June."},

The one thing about the Trip 35 is that it has two shutter speeds - 1/30th and 1/200th sec.  So long as you don't get too far out of the camera's \"comfort zone\" you will have great results.

That doesn't give me much to experiment with, but I know that whatever the results, they probably won't be what I expected.  I know that it's a bit late to talk about a discontinued film, but just in case you find one of these films, you may want to grab it and shoot.Lomochrome Turquoise XR 100-400Not to be confused with Lomochrome Purple, which gives a bit of faux IR-look to the images, the Turquoise has amazing color shifts that totally blew me away.  I had one roll to play with, and shot it with my Minolta Maxxum 5 last April.  Some of the images were taken at the Ann Arbor Festifools parade, and the colors are definitely amazing, and odd.  The film is ISO 400 and fine-grained, and as advertised by Lomography \"LomoChrome Turquoise lets you explore the color spectrum like you never have before. Warm colors become blue, blue becomes golden and green becomes emerald. Capable of producing picture-perfect photos totally naturally, Lomochrome Turquoise will bathe your photos in lustrous tones from a broader color spectrum.\"    I can't do better than that hype. It is a C-41 color negative film with oddball color shifts that I find quite endearing.No longer Maize and Blue!Lomography Color X-Pro Sunset Strip 100 Also now discontinued, this is indeed a strange film that is in reality, an E-6 (color slide) film that has no orange mask. Hence the x-pro designation.    I shot the roll with my Minolta Hi-Matic G camera, and developed in home C-41 chemistry.  The film looks very blue, and is also extremely curly, making scans difficult.  I don't know if it is the age of the film, but it is grainy and my best shots were taken with plenty of sunlight. In gray skies the colors are very muted.  The scanner had a bit of a hard time with the color for some of the frames that were taken under cloudy conditions, so I expect that the film has better results when there is plenty of light and good contrast. As the Lomo site advertises, \"This emulsion is truly for the bravest of Lomographers.\"You can see how odd the film looks after developingOutside of Zingerman's candy storeSee the  wrist strap on the lower right.

Part of the fascination has been the stories aboutMaier – a secretive nanny with an odd French accent; her Rolleiflexaround her neck, seemingly everywhere; her trove of images that hadnever been seen by the public; and her photographic travels inChicago and New York.  The other part of this has been the imagesthemselves.  No one can deny that that she made some fantasticphotographs that certainly are as good as any other photographer that was known for street photography at that time.  Her output wasprolific, and of course, since we only know of her after her death,we will never know exactly why she chose to not share her work. Until this latest book by Pamela Bannos, the Vivian Maier story wasbeing told and promoted by those that had much to benefit from themassive find of a lifetime.  I don't fault John Maloof for promotinghis version of Vivian Maier's story, nor the authors of other books,which I will list at the end.  One thing all of them have in common,is that they tell an incomplete story, and the narratives are largelydevoid of in-depth research -- partly because of the fact that it wasin the self-interest of the owners of Maier's photographs to publishand promote her images. Inthe rush to capitalize on the popularity of the Vivian Maier storyand the photographs, Maloof and others determined the narrative,sometimes obscuring or ignoring information that would have providedus with a more complex version of Vivian Maier.   She had to be morethan a nanny, and she was not a photography savant.  Don't get me wrong, I love seeing her images in print -- but until Bannos' book, we did not have the sort of arduous and exhaustive scholarly work that was needed to more fully inform us about the actual photographer.My first inclination to think we werenot getting the full story, was when it was reported that she wasusing a box camera and then went suddenly to a Rolleiflex TLR.  Those6x9 cm images were not of box-camera quality, and were quite possiblydone with a 120 roll-film folding camera, which would have allowedfor a variety of exposure settings and focusing.  That “box-camera”narrative was carried on throughout the Maloof version of events. Pamela Bannos (a professor of photography at Northwestern University)also realized that this was incongruent with what she was seeing, andher meticulous research on Vivian Maier's life and ancestry hasprovided us with a fascinating read that has the paralleljuxtaposition in the text of the arcs of her life and of her“afterlife” – the scattering of her belongings and how theycame to our view.  She also addresses the issues of copyright andethics of the factions involved with her estate.Vivian Maier was far more than a nanny- she was a world-wise traveler, a keen observer, a daring andself-confident photographer, and yet, she chose not to exhibit herwonderful photographs.  Bannos' research provides us with a morecomplete account of Maier's life, and in a way, gives her a voicethat was not present in the previous attempts by other authors.  Inthis book, we actually see a timeline of Vivian's whereabouts, and onhow she photographed a scene – not with one shot, but with anobvious planned approach with an image sequence that gives us an ideaof how she worked.   Yes, Vivian Maier was an unconventional person. Had she been famous in life, she would be shoulder to shoulder withall of the other “unconventional” women of her time.  There is nodoubt of her photographic artistry.  We are left with a legacy ofwork that others have promoted, curated, printed, and sold withoutVivian's oversight or background stories.  I think Pamela Bannos hasgiven balance to the Vivian Maier phenomenon, and her book is amust-read if you are at all interested in the Vivian Maier story.

{"title": "Some winter scenery on Kodak 2238 film.", "date": "Saturday, December 30, 2017", "text": "a roll of 2238 from theUltrafine Online site.If you have been following this blog for awhile, you'll know that I am always eager to try out some odd b&w films.  A few months ago, I purchased some Kodak 2238 Panchromatic Separation Film from Ultrafine Online.  It has been touted as a \"poor man's TechPan!\" and after seeing results from my first roll of this film, I am inclined to agree.  The typical use of this film is to make archival black and white positive separations from color movie film negatives. It can also be used to make special effects, panchromatic masters from b&w negatives, and other movie-industry applications. It's on a polyester ESTAR base like Techpan, and has a blue-antihalation dye that comes out in developing.I loaded up a Nikon F2 with a plain prism, and headed out into the 10 degree F weather at Matthaei Botanical Gardens.  The film is rated from ISO 6 to 50, depending on the use, I suppose, and I followed Ultrafine's suggestion of ISO 25.  Unlike TechPan, this film can be developed as a panchromatic pictorial film in D-76 (1:1 for 10 minutes), which greatly facilitates its use, and not having to use my dwindling supply of Technidol. Photographer's Formulary sells the TD-3 low contrast developer for films like Techpan that would otherwise result in high-contrast negatives using typical developers.   Winter warrior.Shooting in winter in northern climates has its share of obstacles - cold temperatures mean low battery life when outside, and I picked the meterless plain prism F2 because it works flawlessly without a battery, and the ergonomics with gloves on make it easy to use. I had an external meter, but generally went sunny-16 for most of my shots.  In full sun, that would be f/16 and 1/30 sec, or f/11 at 1/60, or f/8 at 1/125.  F8 at 1/125 seemed to work pretty well when it was sunny.I developed the film as I described above, in D76.  Some of the frames were underexposed, and I think that was when I forgot to adjust my aperture when the sun went behind the clouds. For the images that I estimated properly, the negatives looked good.   At ISO 25, I would recommend a tripod for most subjects, but my results were pretty good.Okay, so if this film is like TechPan, how does the grain stack up?  It is extremely fine-grained, and almost as good as TechPan. I would say that the negatives do remind me of that film, and I will have to experiment with it some more to get an idea of how versatile it is.  Some portraits are in order, as well as some non-snowy scenes.  The film comes in 100 foot rolls as well as 36 exp. cassettes, so for $50, one could do quite a bit of testing with the bulk roll.  It may be advisable to bracket to see how the film performs for your particular use. The nice thing is that it is also easy and economical to develop!Here are a few images from that roll that I shot earlier this week. One of the fun aspects of film shooting is the appreciation for different films and the qualities that each film stock has.  Shooting something new (to me) means that the results may not always be what I expected.  In the case of the Kodak 2238, I think the shots where I exposed correctly have good range and bode well for further testing.  The film is a tad curly drying, but flattened out fine in the scanner film holder.  I suggest that you give this interesting film a try. There are plenty of examples of it on Flickr."},
{"title": "Happy Holidays ", "date": "Friday, December 22, 2017", "text": "December is the month where the Winter Solstice occurs, and in human history, the end of the shortening days and beginning of longer days has not gone unnoticed. Lights have a way of chasing out the darkness, and while in our modern society we have no lack of artificial light, it is hard to imagine what our ancestors thought a few thousand years ago.  The Solstice became the focus of many traditions, and a celebration to mark the appearance of longer days ahead.  For me, Christmas has always been about the tree and the lights, and the excitement of the season.  However you celebrate this season, I hope that peace and happiness becomes more attainable.Photography is one of those things that has sustained me over time -- in terms of creativity, activity, and making connections.  I think I have met some of the most amazing people that carry around cameras.  I plan on shooting more medium format this coming year, and also thinning down my accumulation of 35mm cameras.  I still plan on testing and reporting on random cameras -- hence this blog, and my association with the Film Photography Project.  I hope that more people keep coming to using film and finding how fun it can be.   You can simplify everything down to one body and a few lenses (or just one lens) and yet have a bunch of film stocks that have such different characteristics that will open up the artistic and creative process to all sorts of possibilities.  Shoot at ISO 6 sometime and see how those films determine what is possible.  Black and white emulsions, C-41 color, E-6 color-- there are all sorts of possibilities in 35mm. 120 film has fewer choices, but those bigger negatives sure are nice.  Large format? I rarely shoot that, but of you are looking for a challenge, go for it!This has been quite a year for me, and on top of everything else, I find myself retired after working for 36.5 years at the University of Michigan.  My career has been in Natural History, more precisely, Entomology, and managing museum collections.  I have some research projects that I want to finish, and that will happen in the coming year.  I plan to devote myself more to doing photo projects as well.  Over the years, I have accumulated enough of a body of work to proceed with some small exhibits, and perhaps some publications on Blurb or elsewhere.   I hope that you like my cameras on the tree this year!"},
{"title": "Out and about with my Zorki 2C.", "date": "Sunday, December 17, 2017", "text": "Back in March, I purchased a Zorki 2C from a Ukraine eBay seller.  I had seen my buddy Marc's Leica IIIf when we met for coffee, so I decided to find a cheap LTM (Leica Thread Mount) Soviet camera online.  I had previously owned a Fed 5, and sold it to a friend when she was looking for an affordable and reliable manual rangefinder camera.  However, the Fed 5 did not look at all like a Leica II or III.   I found a Zorki 2C and it came with an Industar 61 52mm f/2.8 lens for $28 + $18 shipping.  It arrived within a few weeks in excellent condition.  On closer inspection, there were microscratches on the lens, which would definitely cause some loss of contrast.  I eventually found an Industar 50 lens on ebay for $10 + free shipping.  That lens has a maximum aperture of f/3.5 and I have the same lens in an M42 mount.  It's definitely a good, but not a fast lens. The Zorki 2C has strap lugs, which earlier Zorki models do not.  For me, that was a necessity as I hate never-ready cases.  The Zorki 2C, like most of the cameras from the Soviet era, is built pretty robustly, and has a limited selection of shutter speeds.  B, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100, 1/250, 1/500 sec.  Which, when you think about it, actually cover most situations with a handheld camera.  It has a separate window for the rangefinder, and both viewfinders are eye-glass scratchers.  Certainly not as good as my Leica M2, but better than an Argus C3!For me, it was a question that I needed to answer - \"How good is a Soviet copy of a Leica II in operation.?\"  The Zorki 2C certainly is a compact, manual 35 mm camera that looks very \"old school\" and requires no battery for anything.  You can use an external light meter or sunny-16 for setting your exposure.  On my outings with the camera, I used sunny-16, and did pretty well. One other caveat that users of any LTM camera that loads from the bottom (as opposed to a hinged back) is that you need to cut your film leader just like the Leicas required them to be.  Otherwise, your film might hang up and you will have problems. Other than the film leader issue, remember to cock the shutter before you change the shutter speed.  These cameras are easy to use, all-metal, and easy to find online.  I really like taking it out to shoot with, and overall, I am quite happy with my Zorki 2C.  I may look for a collapsible Elmar-like Soviet (collapsible Industar 50) lens in the future, but for now I am set with what I have. The collapsible lens really makes this a coat pocket camera.These images were taken earlier this year on Polypan-F film, which has no anti-halation layer, and an ISO of 50.These photos were taken on hand-spooled Ilford HP-5+ just a few weeks ago.So, there you go.  The Zorki 2C is an affordable LTM camera that deserves a try."},
{"title": "The Agfa Silette-L:  It's 1962 all over again", "date": "Tuesday, December 05, 2017", "text": "Clean and simple design The nineteen-sixties saw a lot of innovation in cameras, and as photography became ever more accessible and affordable, we saw the simplicity of the Kodak Instamatic with its Kodapak 126 cartridge, and an ever-increasing level of automation in the 35mm camera world.  However, in 1962, cameras with Selenium meters were quite common, as consumers wanted more features that helped them take better photos.  While a coupled meter is ideal, uncoupled meters still give you enough information to set your camera to the desired exposure. This Silette L, while being fairly simple, is still capable of good images.Top Deck of cameraAgfa sold a number of 35mm cameras with the Silette name. The series was first introduced in 1953 and the line ended around 1975, when cameras with more automation (Optima Sensor series) were becoming more desirable.  In its heyday, several million Silettes sold within the first few years, with a long series of models with designations that reappeared at various dates.  The first Silette L appeared in 1956, with an uncoupled Selenium meter and a Color Apotar 45mm f/2.8 lens.  This model, is the 1962 version with a Color Agnar 45mm f/2.8 lens and a Prontor 125 shutter.  The shutter speeds are B, 1/30, 1/60, and 1/125 sec.  Not exactly a big range to choose from, but certainly workable.  The minimum aperture is f/22. The Selenium meter is read from the top deck of the camera, and adjusting the dial to the left of the match needle to center the needle gives you the shutter speed/aperture combination to set the exposure to.  Or, you can ignore it and use mostly the Sunny-16 rules for your exposure.In practice, I found the meter to be accurate outdoors, and the ISO setting dial has an amazing range of 10 to 3200!  Of course, with a shutter a max shutter speed of 1/125 sec, I can't imagine trying to use high-ISO film.film counter placementOther than the limited shutter speeds, this camera was fun to use, and I am impressed with the non-coupled Selenium meter.  No batteries ever required.  I suspect the meter was in such good shape because the camera had been kept in a never-ready case for many years.I loaded a roll of Ilford FP-4+ b&w film and shot the 36 exposures over the course of a few weeks.  I generally went by the metering suggested, though in bright sun, I just used f/16 at 1/125 sec.  I developed the film in Rodinal at 1:25 dilution for 9 minutes.  The frames were very evenly spaced, and the negatives had slightly rounded corners.  All of the exposures looked great.  I didn't tax the camera too much, as I did not try it with a flash or dimly-lit situations. Although the camera has \"guess\" or zone focus, most of my shots were spot on because they were 25 feet away. The lens focuses from 1 meter to infinity. The Agnar lens is a triplet, and most of my shots were with the lens stopped down to f/11 or smaller. Everything looked quite sharp.Pittsfield Twp. erectionInside playground equipmentDexter, MIDexter, MIDexter, MIMatthaei Botanical GardensMatthaei Botanical GardensMatthaei Botanical GardensIn a nutshell, I found the Silette-L easy to use, and it worked very well.  Any film from ISO 25 to 200 should be usable, given the range of shutter speeds.  Price? Mine was free, but expect to pay between $10 and $40 for one on ebay.  There are many different Silette models, some of which are simpler than this one, so look carefully before you buy."},
{"title": "I sure do love Chromes, and you should, too!", "date": "Friday, December 01, 2017", "text": "Many of us baby boomers were subject to slide showsFor most of my years, there was just one way to share your photos to a bunch of people at once -- a slide projector.  To do that, you needed to use reversal film, also known as slides, chromes, or transparencies. Reversal film is called that because the normal photo image is a negative, which is printed to make a positive.  With reversal film, you get a positive after developing.  Of course, since the idea is to project the image, and view it as a positive, there is no orange mask, and the base is clear, hence, they are transparent.    They became the defacto medium for most pro photographers, unless they were shooting black and white.  If you were a nature photographer, it was a given that you shot slide film.  It allowed editors to quickly pick the best images out on a light table; the individual slides were easily packaged and labelled, and passed along to the composition dept., etc.  Magazines like National Geographic bought cases of film (especially Kodachrome) for the photographers, so that a single batch all had the same color characteristics.In the amateur photography sector, countless vacations and moments were shot on slide film so that they could be projected and \"enjoyed.\"   The process was so simple -- shoot your rolls, send them off to Kodak, and get back beautiful color slides in mounts so that they could be loaded into the projector.    Then came the digital onslaught and almost overnight, slides became an anachronism, as computer LCD projectors replaced the beautiful slide presentations.  The medium and large formats were also affected by the digital tide, though they comprised a smaller pie of the transparency film sales.  At this point, two processes produced transparencies -- K-14 -- Kodachrome (limited to 35mm at the end) and E-6 -- Kodak's Ektachrome line, Fuji's Velvia, Sensia, and Provia lines, and and a few lesser-known emulsions  from Europe and Japan.  In the year 2000, there were  about 40 different color slide films available, from Kodachrome 25 to Ektachrome P1600 Professional.  Some films were made for shooting in tungsten lighting, such as Fujichrome 64T and Kodachrome 64T.  Often, those were used for studio work to photograph artwork and still-lifes.  The prices, in year 2000 prices for 36-exposure rolls ranged from cheap Imation Chrome 100 (Ferrania) at $6.80/roll to $18/roll for Fujichrome Provia 1600.   During the period from 1981-2005, I shot a lot of slide film; some of it was Kodachrome, but a lot was Fuji Sensia and Velvia, as well as various flavors of Ektachrome.Kodak's Kodachrome was king of the chromes, untilVelvia came along.Some juicy 120 chrome film from my fridgeThere used to be more choicesThe other effect that digital had on slide films was the loss of local E-6 labs.  When pros were using E-6, local labs got a lot of work, and they dwindled as digital became the norm for most professional work.  Kodachrome was last processed in 2010, and aside from some experimental forays by a few people, the old expired boxes of Kodachrome are best left on the shelf. It's too bad that people forget how many jobs were lost due to the digital avalanche.  Now, there are few local film labs of any sort, and the mail-order labs have dwindled to a few major ones that are now seeing their business grow as film becomes more popular (such as The Darkroom).  However, if you want to shoot E-6 films, you can process the film yourself at home.  Unicolor has a kit that is sold under several brand names, but the Film Photography Project Store certainly has the best deal.So, that brings us to the present-day.  As far as fresh slide film, Fuji is the only current manufacturer, though Kodak should start putting its new Ektachrome on the shelves in the coming months.  That's a big deal, since Kodak was out of the slide film business about 5 years ago.  While Film Ferrania has had a struggle getting their slide film into production, it's largely been because of matters that are not directly related to the film itself.  I hope that they are successful in the end.  That brings me to other sources for slide or chrome films, and that would be the Film Photography Project.  They sell a line called Retrochrome, and there are two films available - Retrochrome 160 and Retrochrome  320 - both are \"expired\" but certainly quite usable and the FPP has a large quantity of these films.  I have shot both, and of the two, I like the 320 film much more.  I feel my initial tries with it at 320 seemed overexposed, so I have been shooting it at 400.  The color palette is warm, and the film has grain, giving a definite \"retro\" look.   I would also check  Ultrafine Online's catalog as they offer fresh Fuji slide film and some expired but usable chrome films, too.  Freestyle Photo is another good source for fresh slide film.A hanging file sheet with slidesRetrochrome 320120 transparencies, shot with a Mamiya C330I really love seeing color transparencies, especially on 120 film.  Spreading out a bunch of color slides on a light table is quite enjoyable, too. Each image is bordered by a frame, and become separate photos.  While I rarely show slides these days, I still have lots of 2x2 slides in archival sheets.  My recently shot images are just scanned like any film strip, and kept in negative preservers.  But if I wanted to, I could easily put them into individual slide mounts. My 120 chromes are also kept in clear archival holders.  I have a bunch of frozen 120 Velvia and Provia that should last me for a while.So, you may wonder why should you even bother to use chrome films?  You can cross process them in C-41 chemistry for a different look, as Lomography folks have been doing for years.  However, standard E-6 chemistry gives you a more accurate color rendition.   Use can also use the narrower latitude to your advantage if you want a more high-key washed out look, which is what slight overexposure will give you. Chrome films have to be exposed correctly, as there is less latitude than a C-41 color film. However, when you see your transparencies that are properly exposed, you will appreciate the magic that the chrome films can produce.Retrochrome 320 at 400 Mackinac Bridge on expired Fujichrome 64TColor IR on FPP Infrachrome filmLake George area on Retrochrome 320Wassiac, NY on WittnerchromePotsdam, NY on Retrochrome 160Presque Isle sunset on Velvia 50 @40Fall reflections on Velvia 50 @40"},
{"title": "The Minolta Hi-Matic G (Gee, it worked!)", "date": "Monday, November 20, 2017", "text": "I have a love-hate relationship with those 1970’s 35mm rangefinder and compact zone-focus cameras. Far too many of them to keep track of, and far too many that took Mercury cells or some odd-ball battery that I can’t find, and far too many of them that now, don’t work.  On the plus side, they are usually sturdy little metal boxes, attractive, and easy to use. Over the years, I have had Minolta  RFs land in my lap, and a few, such as a Minolta 7s worked quite well, but I didn’t fall in love with it.  I had a Hi-matic G in 2005, but it had exposure issues.   The worst aspect of the Hi-Matic series (with one exception) is the auto-exposure with no manual capability.  In regards to the Hi-Matic G, it’s not an especially singular camera, and is a middle of the road auto-exposure compact RF camera with a zone/scale focus, with the following features:Rokkor 38mm f/1:2.8 lens with 46mm filter thread,  f/2.8-f/14 aperture Zone & Scale focus with symbols and numbers CdS meter in lens bezel, so you can use filters and expose correctly ISO range : 25-400 Shutter: 1/30-1/650 Battery : PX675 (I used a standard S76 cell, and with negative films, it should be just fine). Viewfinder shows shutter speed/aperture on right side. Hotshoe and PC connector for flash standard 1/4-20 tripod threadThe ISO range is a limiting feature, but given the time when these cameras were made, entirely proper for the audience they were being sold to.   Not having a B setting is also limiting.   There is not really much to distinguish it from a slew of other compact 35mm cameras of its time.  The Konica C-35 has similar specs, but has a real rangefinder, not scale focus.  The Sears 35RF is similar. As much as I want to like the Hi-Matic G, the Hi-Matic 7SII (quite different from the 7S!) is the camera of the Hi-Matic series that should be on your list (and eBay prices are high).   The Ricoh 500G is another compact, yet robust RF camera, with reasonable prices on the used market. It too, is fully adjustable in manual mode. The Canonet QL-17 is not much larger, and certainly a better camera than the Hi-Matic G.p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545}p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545; min-height: 14.0px}li.li1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545}ul.ul1 {list-style-type: disc}I tested the camera with such a S76 cell, and a roll of Svema 100 b&w - my cheap go-to film for testing.  Overall, I feel the camera works well, and it passed the test to be a pocket companion."},
{"title": "The Bronica SQ-B - A Perfect Square!", "date": "Monday, November 13, 2017", "text": "I have owned and used many different cameras over the years, but there was one brand that I had absolutely no experience with, that being Bronica.  Known for their various medium-format cameras, Bronica was a brand that I knew little about. I had heard people say both good and bad things about the cameras, but generally the consensus was that the build was not as good as a Hasselblad.  Last year, in a segment on the Film Photography Project Podcast, we had a discussion about cameras, and I said that there are times that I would like to shoot with a particular camera for a while, but not necessarily own it.  One of the cameras that fit that bill was the Bronica SQ series, which are medium-format SLR cameras with removable backs, square 6x6 image format, and look much like the archetypical Hasselblad.  I didn’t have any interest in the 6x4.5 Bronicas, as I once owned a Mamiya 645E, and that format doesn’t hold as much interest to me.  A few weeks after the episode aired, Mike Raso contacted me and told me that one of our listeners wanted to contact me and loan me a Bronica SQ series camera to use for a while.  It turns out that David Lyon, one of our FPP followers in Utah has a Bronica SQ-B that had belonged to his sister, and he thought it would be great if I could put it to use for a while.  Dave and I started corresponding, and back in March I received a lovely Bronica SQ-B in the mail with a waist-level view finder, 120 back, and the normal 80mm 2.8 lens.  The Bronica SQ-B is an all-manual 6x6 SLR with shutter speeds from 8 sec. to 1/500 sec, with flash sync at all speeds.  There is no B mode with the standard 80mm lens. The shutter is an electronically controlled Seiko between - lens leaf shutter, meaning that it requires a single 4LR44 6 volt battery to operate.  There is no metering, so a handheld meter needs to be used.  Multiple exposures are possible, as is mirror-lockup shooting.The film back is interchangeable, with backs for 120, 220, and 35mm.  The lens is a Zenzanon -PS/B 80mm f/2.8 standard lens, which focuses from 80 cm to infinity.   The film is advanced via the crank on the right side.  Shutter speeds are controlled by a knob on the left side with a readout that is viewed from above.  The waist level finder (WLF) is bright and a pop-up magnifier is used for critical focusing.  The shutter release button is on the lower right side of the front, and is easy to use.  There is a separate screw-in port for a cable release on the L side of the body.  There are several iterations of SQ models, and the SQ-B appeared in 1996, so it's a relatively recent model.  The B designation may just mean \"Basic\" as that is what the camera really is - basic. The SQ-Ai is the top model with auto-exposure and TTL flash capability.Use of the camera.My previous experience with 6x6 SLRs was with a Kiev 66, Kowa 6, and Hasselblad 500C.  In all ways, I find the Bronica SQ-B to be a better camera in terms of ease of use, control layout, and ergonomics.  For those days when gloves are needed, the controls are easy to use.  If you have ever tried to use a Hasselblad with gloves on, you’ll appreciate the Bronica.  The dark slide is easy to remove and insert, and the winding crank needs one turn to advance the the film.  Not having a meter was not a problem. I used a Pentax Spotmeter or a Sekonic Twin-mate hand-held meter or sunny-16 while shooting.  That would have been the case had I used the Hasselblad.   The camera balanced nicely in my hands and the WLF worked great.  I found that a Pentax 67 close-up lens on the 80mm lens was really wonderful for close-up portraits.   I carried the Bronica in a shoulder bag with a Nikon SLR and found that the Bronica was not overly heavy in that regard, and it certainly hung fine around my neck with a Tamrac strap.   Some people don’t like WLFs, but for 6x6, I think it’s great.  Of course the image is reversed L-R, but that’s usually only a problem with photographing moving objects.  It’s the same as using a TLR in that regard.  There are prism finders available for the SQ series, but I like the simplicity and unobtrusive nature of the WLF.Summary of my experienceI don’t know why the Bronica series of cameras have been maligned by some. Perhaps it is just Hasselblad snobbery.  I am a pretty experienced photographer, and have used and handled a LOT of cameras.  I found the controls and layout superior to the 500c I once owned, and my user experience was excellent.  I downloaded a SQ-B manual before attempting to use the camera, and that’s critical for anyone unfamiliar with a new camera.  The controls are simple to use and there are no distractions when using this camera.  The question is — “Should I buy one?”  My answer is a resounding “YES!”    I liked the results that I got from the Bronica, and I have posted a few of my favorites below.    I thank David Lyon for allowing me to use the camera for most of this year.  I find that FPP listeners are great people with a common bond of film photography.   Now, another camera that I would like to try out for a bit is a Horizon!p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545}p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #454545; min-height: 14.0px}"},

Whether it is the simply a revival of film due to people looking for something new, or people fed up with digital perfection, or a surge of interest in film as an artistic medium, there is no doubt that we are seeing not only a surge in film sales, but introductions of new films from manufacturers other than the BIG THREE (Kodak, Ilford, Fuji).  What has been noticeable is the indifference of the major camera manufacturers to this phenomenon.  Lomography is the mainstay in terms of offering up new film cameras, as well as resurrecting some of the cameras from the former Soviet Union.  Yes, I am fully aware of the massive number of film cameras sitting out there, waiting to be used -- literally millions.  Yet, they are ageing, and repairs for them are getting iffy, seeing that there are a limited number of places that can do major repairs of cameras.  What about a new, attractively priced Nikon FM-style camera, or a Pentax K1000-style camera, or maybe even a Canon EOS film camera? Nada from those guys.  They are putting their money into yet another iteration of digital cameras that will make you have to get a new computer to keep up with the size of the digital files. Most of us that are hobbyists long ago figured out that 14 MP was enough. Hell, for many things, a 6MP DSLR is enough.The Ricoh SLX 500 is a good, no-frills manual SLR that could serve as the type of basic SLR that could be made.I have a good number of excellent film cameras, so why should I worry?  But, there are probably thousands of people that would buy a new 35mm SLR if any were available, especially if it were offered in a lens mount that is popular.  I know that Cosina made the Bessaflex around 2002, and I sort of lusted for one for a while.  The Nikon FM10 was made until very recently.  So, Cosina would be the obvious choice for a manufacturer of a new SLR.  But nooooo!Enter the announcement of some surprises in the past few weeks on Kickstarter.The REFLEX camera was announced just about two weeks ago, with little initial information. At first, I was skeptical of the product (for the aforementioned reasons), but after they released their video and the camera specs, it now seems like a pretty interesting advancement in a 35mm SLR.Now, there is also another 35mm SLR, the Ihagee Elbaflex. Incorporating a Nikon F-mount is a great idea, and I am waiting to see more information in a few days.  This is the type of camera that I would hope for, and something that schools could actually purchase as a learning tool.  The 1/500 sec max shutter speed may seem limiting, but really, it's not.  Perhaps it is a clone of the old Kiev 19, which has an F-mount (and I have one of those).  We will see more about the product in a few days.  EDIT -- Today's (11/12) post from Kosmo Foto also hints at the Elbaflex being a revamped Kiev 19 SLR.The Kiev 19, while not a Nikon FM, is certainly a functional SLR.Much as the new films are coming from small companies (Bergger, Silberra, Maco, Foma, etc.), the new cameras are coming from small startups with the idea that they will fill a demand for new film cameras. I seriously hope that they succeed and perhaps that will get Cosina in the picture to re-issue some basic 35mm SLRS as well."},
{"title": "A Well-done Bergger!", "date": "Sunday, October 08, 2017", "text": "A few months back, I finally ordered a brick of the Bergger Pancro400, a new French B&W film.  Bergger is well-known for its printing papers, but the film is a 2016 introduction.  The film is a two (panchromatic) emulsion film, with the emulsion being composed of silver bromide and silver iodide, and is supposed to result in a wider exposure latitude.First of all, it is well-packaged, with development information on the inside of the box. To me, that is a great touch and a detail that is very useful with a new film. Of course, the Bergger website has more information, but you don't have to go there, because the info is inside the box. I loaded the film into my Nikon N8008s, and shot it in upstate New York back in July. After I returned, I loaded it into one of my Jobo tanks and set it aside in my darkroom until I could have time to do the developing. Well, no matter how long one has been doing something, there is always a way to screw it up. The roll was a mess, as I had not tightened down the lid on the developing tank, and while the film sat out for a few days, enough dark leaked out that I had obvious light leaks on the film.  While many of the shots were ruined, a few looked pretty good. For the developing, pre-soak the film for 2 minutes. Dump the water and then develop in straight D-76 for 9 minutes. Of course, the usual water rinse for stop bath, and fix for 7 minutes.   I chose the D-76 because it's a standard developer that many people use and one that I use a lot. My first roll was developed in HC-110B, per instructions, and I felt that the D-76 developed negs looked better to my eye. Once dry, the film has a slight cupping to it in the scanner film holder, but lies mostly flat when everything is tightened down. It’s nowhere near as bad as Kodak Tri-X, but not as flat as Ilford HP-5+. Since then I have shot several more rolls.  All are at the box speed (ISO 400), and I did not do any bracketing.  I like my results thus far. It's not every day that we get a new b&w emulsion on the market, and I think the Pancro400 fills a niche that will be appreciated by street photographers. Others have pushed the film to ISO 800 and 1600 with excellent results. Overall, it’s a fast b&w film with nice grain, wide latitude (others have shot it 800 and 1600)  and rich blacks.  It’s worth a try, for sure. It also is available in 120, 4x5, 8x10, etc.   I felt the price was also very good, at less than $6 per 36-exposure roll, making it very competitive with Kodak and Ilford's offerings.Herewith are some examples.My messed up rollAnother from the messed up rollMy neighbor's dog, Mollie.Dinner at Frasier's PubChamomile in  vaseCobblestone Farm at duskSun and bluebirdAbbott'sMy officeChelsea, MIChelsea, MIManchester, MI"},
{"title": "Slow Poke.  Shooting with Kodak 2366 b&w film.", "date": "Tuesday, September 05, 2017", "text": "Over the years, I have shot some unusual films. Most of the odd-ball films tend to come from the cinema world, where specialty films have distinct niches that come into play in making movie titles, b&w duplication, making positives, and other facets of movie-making that we just don't think about. Of course, digital may have reduced the demand for such films, but they are still out there and available. To make matters more interesting, some of these films have low-ISO speeds, high acutance, odd-spectral sensitivity, and may require low-contrast developers to be usable for pictorial use. The Film Photography Project has done a lot to bring us some of these weird films, and I finally got around to shooting a roll of the Kodak 2366 film.  First of all, Kodak 2366 was intended to be a duplication film in the movie industry, making positives from negatives film - direct-duplicating means that the negative of the other strip of movie film is against this film and exposed to a bright (often arc) light to produce a positive print that can be used for projection.  Usage of a particular develop gives a full tonal range. Ah, that's all great, but what about regular photography?  Well here are some points:1. ISO 6  (not all cameras go this low,  but my N8008 and F100 do.  Otherwise, the typical lowest ISO is 12, so set your ISO at 12 and add 1 full stop of exposure compensation.)2. With such a low ISO, you should use a tripod to eliminate shake.3. This is a blue-sensitive film.  Designed to produce b&w positives from b&w negatives, it will have full tonality. However, shooting a real scene will render reds much darker. 4. The spec sheet calls for  D-96 developer, which is used in machine processing of movie film. I won't go into it's differences from Kodak D-76, but using D-76 will produce good results with this film.5. Developing in D-76 - dilute 1:1, and develop for 8-1/2 minutes. A water stop bath will be fine.  Fix in your typical fixer for 8 min.  Wash how you would any b&w film. I put a roll in my Nikon N8008s, and shot it on a sunny afternoon in downtown Ann Arbor.  I shot hand-held, because I had left my tripod in the car.  However, it freed me up to do some shots with it that I normally would not do.  I developed as indicated above, and was rewarded with some interesting results:Overall, the film yielded some pretty good and interesting results.  While ISO 6 is recommended, I think it could have used a bit more exposure where there were dark reds (bricks).  So maybe ISO 3 might be better.  Using such a low ISO in the photo of the people on the scooters had me panning with the camera as they went past.  Makes them look like they are going much faster!  I have another roll to shoot and maybe I will do some bracketing at ISO 3 and 6 and see if there are any differences."},
{"title": "Back to Basics - Tamron Adaptall-2 Lenses", "date": "Sunday, August 06, 2017", "text": "I was at the Kiwanis Thrift shop yesterday and spied a few things that I decided to buy. One of them was a 70-210 mm zoom for $5.  Ho hum, you say.  It wasn't just any zoom, it was a Tamron Adaptall-2 lens with an Olympus OM mount.  In excellent condition.  FIVE BUCKS.  It sold for almost $300 when it was new, in the 1980s.  I have owned the very same lens model several times over the years, and I was always pleased with my results from it.  First of all, let me tell you what makes the lens so special.  It's an Adaptall-2 lens, meaning that, with the appropriate mount adapter, it can be used with virtually any 35mm SLR - Konica AR, Olympus OM, Nikon F, Canon FD, Pentax K, 42mm SM, Leicaflex,  Minolta MD, etc. My $5 lensSecond, Tamron Adaptall-2 SP lenses are excellent, and at the time, presented photographers with a less-expensive alternative to the camera-maker's lenses.  If you changed your camera brand (and mount), you would only have to buy a new Adaptall-2 mount for the lens, which was far cheaper than buying new glass. It allows you to use the same lens with different SLR mounts, merely by having the proper adapter.  Take for instance the 90 mm f/2.5 macro lens. I have had it for close to 20 years, and it remains one of my favorite lenses. Originally, I used with a Nikon, and have used it on K-mount and Minolta MD-mount cameras, which is what it is on now. Without the matched extension tube, it produces 1:2 magnification.  With it, the lens gives you life size macro  (1:1).  It's also an excellent portrait lens.the 90mm macro on my Minolta XG-MThe 90mm macro.  It's been used a lot.The 28-70 lens is also very good -- low distortion at wide-angle, and a perfect range for most travel.  It's a bit weighty, with the glass and metal.  However, it will not disappoint you with the results.Back to the 70-210mm f/4 SP zoom. -- What I always loved about this lens is that it close focuses to about 3 feet - at 210mm, it gives you quite a good magnification (1:4) of close-up subjects.    The 35-135mm is another excellent zoom, allowing you to close focus at 0.8 meters!   Using the Adaptall-2 system gives you access to quite a few excellent lenses and allows a lot of flexibility if you use several types of SLR systems.  Sharing lenses save you some money, and the Adaptall-2 lenses really are worth trying out if you have not previously done so.  The various adapters are easy to find on Ebay, and often, they are New In Box.  Unfortunately, except for the K-Mount and Nikon mounts, they will not fit AF SLRS.  You can use them in manual  mode on your Nikon and Pentax DSLRs.  If you are using any of the mirrorless systems, you will likely find a mount that will allow you to use it in manual mode. There are some quite good sites that feature a lot of information on the Tamron Adaptall-2 lenses, so I am not going to reproduce the information here.  My favorite site is apotelyt. Matt's Classic Cameras also has an Adaptall-2 page. There is a also a video showing how to change the adapter here. An excellent lens with a good range.$269.00 in the early 1980s!the 28-70 zoom with OM adapter removedline up the green dots when mounting the adapterAdapter mounted and lens ready to put on the camera.A sturdy, well-built lens.  Finally, a couple of images shot on my Nikon D3200 with the Adaptall-2 70-210 mm lens.  Hand-held, at ISO 800.  Not too shabby for a $5 lens.

{"title": "Ilford FP-4+ - A great medium-speed B&W film ", "date": "Saturday, July 08, 2017", "text": "I have long been a fan of Ilford's films -- and if you shoot a lot of monochrome film, you'll know that Ilford is a brand that is monochrome only.  I have reviewed a lot of films on this blog, but have skipped many popular emulsions, because I figure that everyone knows about them.   However, with the resurgence of film, I realize that some films definitely should get a shout out.  A few years ago, Kodak discontinued their Plus-X Pan film.  Plus-X was a very good old-style film with good grain, latitude, and with an ISO of 125, it was great for allowing a shallower depth-of-field in brighter light than Kodak Tri-X.  Kodak felt that the Tmax 100 was a good substitute and it also used less silver than Plus-X, thus saving them money. In any case, Ilford has been making FP-4+ for a long time, and it remains an excellent medium-speed black and white film.  I feel the images from it have a great tonal scale, and there is no type of subject that it does not do well with.  It has excellent latitude and sharpness, depending on your developer.I have been shooting with FP-4+ for almost 20 years, and while it is obviously not the only 100-125 ISO film out there, I consistently get good results with it.  My typical developer is D76, diluted 1:1 for 11 minutes.  D-23 for 6 minutes also works well.  Since it is a current film, the Massive Development Chart will give you other choices.  It is available in 35mm, 120, 4x5, and 8x10.  I find to be the ideal \"every day\" film for me. Here is a small sample of images from my archive of images shot on Ilford FP-4+ film:"},

This time, I only brought film cameras and my iPhone SE.  Some of my shots on film were made after I did a version on my iPhone to see how it would look in b&w, for instance.  Aside from that, the camera phone is a creative tool, and I enjoyed seeing what I could get with it.  My arsenal was 2 Nikon FMs, Pentax 6x7, Leica M2, Olympus Trip 35, Ondu 6x9 pinhole camera, and my Canon AW-1.  The Ondu got to shoot Reany Falls, and I look forward to seeing how those negatives come out. The weather had its moments, as Sunday morning was cool and wet, with some fog.  It felt more like September than June, but that's why I love the UP.  The weather can change quickly, and it is rarely dull along Lake Superior.  On the other hand, I saw a most glorious sunrise while out walking on Friday morning.

{"title": "Caffenol, the Universal Developer?", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2017", "text": "One of the interesting aspects of film photography is that it is a chemical process.  Therefore, there are myriads of combinations of developers and films that give us differing results. The process encourages experimentation, and while there are varying opinions on what constitutes the ideal developer, ideal film, and so on, the results are a reflection of a photographer's eye and what he/she considers acceptable results.  In addition to that circle, there are people that look for the unusual and one of those is to find the household \"chemicals\" that allow us to develop a roll of traditional black and white film.  This is one of those aspects of developing film that I find quite interesting.  One popular \"household\" developer is Caffenol, which contains a strong mix of dissolved instant coffee. The cheaper the brand, the better.  There are various formulations of Caffenol, and the typical mixture contains instant coffee, Vitamin-C, and Sodium Carbonate (washing soda).  There is a really great resource for those wanting to know more about it at caffenol.org.   I have made my own Caffenol concoctions with decent results, but it's been a few years since I have used it.  However, a few months ago I received a packet from the FPP store of the pre-mixed Caffenol sold by Labeauratoire.  If you just want to try using Caffenol, this is a good way to sample it without buying all of the components and mixing it yourself, and you can decide if it is worth going that route if you like the results. Note -- you can also use Caffenol to develop prints - and \"tone\" them at the same time, but I have not tried it myself.Mixing is easy -- just follow the instructions on the packet, and allow it to cool to 20C before developing your film.  The contents of the packet makes enough developer to do 4 rolls of 35mm film.  The beauty of Caffenol, absent of any other advice, is that you typically develop for 15 minutes for any film. Pretty simple, right?  Of course, the smell of the concoction is not the greatest, and if you were expecting the aroma of a fresh cup of coffee, you'll be disappointed. You are not supposed to drink the stuff, anyway.I developed 2 rolls of 35mm and 1 roll of 120 film before I dumped the Caffenol down the drain.  One of the rolls was Agfa Copex Rapid film - a high contrast film that is similar to Kodak technical Pan film.  I have heard that people have gotten good results with TechPan in caffenol, so I was curious as to how the roll would come out.  The other 35mm roll was expired IIlford Pan-F, and a 120 roll of Agfa APX 100.  Standard Kodak fixer was used, and the stop bath was just a water bath, which also washed away the dark Caffenol from the film.Results -- very good. In fact, far better than I expected. All the negatives looked good, and the Agfa Copex was contrasty, as I would have expected.  However, the cool thing is that I developed the Agfa and the Ilford 35mm films together in the tank.  That would not have happened with other developers.Some samplesexpired Pan-F at ISO 32, Olympus OM-2expired Pan-F at ISO 32, Olympus OM-2expired Pan-F at ISO 32, Olympus OM-2Agfa Copex,  Minolta X370Agfa Copex,  Minolta X370Agfa Copex,  Minolta X370I think you can see that this developer gives you really nice tonality. low-grain, and it's as easy as can be to use.  While the pre-made packet is about the same price as a bag of D-76, it has low toxicity, and can be assembled on your own quite a bit cheaper in quantity.  It's a lot of fun to experiment with developers, and take a look at the Caffenol information online. There is a very enthused community of users out there."},
{"title": "Monochrome C-41 - Ilford XP2 ", "date": "Sunday, June 04, 2017", "text": "A decade ago, if you wanted to shoot b&w with a C-41 film, we had several choices -- there was one from Konica, one from Kodak, and one from Ilford.  Kodak's version had an orange mask like most C-41 films, but Konica's and Ilford's did not (the orange mask made conventional b&w prints more challenging, but I did get good results).  The reasons why someone would want to shoot C-41 b&w are simple -- at the time, it was easily processed by any one-hour lab and did not require any special treatment.  The films were quite good, and I felt that the tonal scale was excellent, especially the Kodak's many iterations of its C-41 B&W. Now, Ilford is the only manufacturer of a C-41 b&w film.  Years ago, I shot XP-1 that was already about a decade expired, and was astonished at how good the results were.  I have shot XP-2 a few times over the years, and found it often was better at an ISO of 320.  Last year, I exchanged a bulk roll of Tri-X for a 10 pack of XP-2, as I wasn't using Tri-X any more.  The XP2 film was a bit expired, and I have been shooting it a bit.  Now that I am doing my own C-41 developing, it's certainly worth noting that it's as easy as any color C-41 film to work with.  Of course, if you wish, you can develop it in b&w chemistry, too, but I have not tried it.  The neutral gray mask allows easier darkroom printing.  Best of all, it scans beautifully, too.   If you are new to film shooting, and want to try b&w, XP2 is a good choice."},
{"title": "Catching Up this Month", "date": "Sunday, May 28, 2017", "text": "setting sun, Cobblestone Farm, iPhone SEHere it is, already the end of May, and I realize that I have not put up a post in 2 weeks.  I have been busy developing and scanning all those films from April and early May, and have more to go before I catch up, that is, if I ever do.   To me, that has always been the fun aspect of film.  While I do shoot a fair amount of digital images, and appreciate the immediacy and creative aspects that it offers, my first love is film.  Developing a roll that I shot last month gives me a different sort of appreciation for \"the moment\" and of course, a much different interaction than if I were just downloading a hundred images off my SD card.  There have been numerous arguments put forth about the benefits of \"slow photography\", the \"love of film\" and so forth, and of course they all have some merit.  The developing and scanning routine for film isn't for everyone, of course, and if your main interest is sharing on social media, then maybe film isn't the best thing.  What really matters is what YOU like.  If you love shooting photos with your phone and are happy with it, keep doing it.  Don't take up shooting film just because it's what all the cool kids are doing.  I recently got my first Apple iPhone, and it's an SE model.  I love it.   I find myself doing things with it that allow me to create some fun and interesting images (IMOO), and it's always in my pocket.  That's not a bad thing. It's a great creative tool. Sometimes, having those tools inspire us to try different shots that we can then later say,  \"I want to shoot that same thing on my Pentax K1000.\"  So, the iPhone (and other cellphones) can also be a sort of  \"idea notebook\" to augment and improve our photography overall.  We can also use them to document our set-up for a shoot, which is also valuable.  You've seen all this before, but since this is primarily a blog about film cameras (though I daresay I have a more than a few digi-entries), I figured that I may as well state the obvious.  The iPhone can make you a better artist, if you choose to let it.  Yes, those Hipstamatic filters are fun, but never confuse the results with the real deal, okay? The other thing I have been doing is mentoring a young woman in film developing.  What I have found, contrary to my previous expectations, is that C-41 processing is probably the easiest intro to film developing!  EVERYTHING has the same time.  You only need to watch the temperature, which is easy with a water bath.  No confusion about times for different films and developers, etc.  Since a 1 liter kit is $20 at the Film Photography Project Store, and I can easily get over a dozen rolls developed from a kit, it is a huge money saver for a beginner.   Then of course, there is the scanning, which has various price points. In the end, it is all quite cheaper than sending your film out, and certainly more satisfying.I recently had my two Nikon FE bodies fully serviced, so there will be a post about that soon.So, as we enter the summer, I'm well-stocked with film, and hope to get a lot of photography done. I want to experiment more with color IR, and do even more shooting with medium-format.  I'll also be sharing my exploits via Instagram (mfophotos), if you care to follow.A few examples of recent C-41 developing...Minolta X700, Superia 800 filmMinolta X700, Superia 800 filmMinolta Maxxum 5, Superia 800 filmMinolta Maxxum 5, Superia 800 filmLomo Sprocket Rocket, Kodak Profoto, 200Olympus Trip 35, Kodak Profoto 200Olympus Trip 35, Kodak Profoto 200"},
{"title": "The MVP- 35mm Plastic Camera from Taiwan ", "date": "Sunday, May 14, 2017", "text": "Introducing the MVP Camera, AKA The \"Optical Lens\" plastic cameras, also known as Taiwan-35s.Whether it started with the TIME camera, or any number of plastic cameras that have that SLR/Rangefinder look, the cameras share similar features.  They have an aperture range of f/6-f/16, one fixed shutter speed, no adjustable focus, and the bezel around the front of the lens says \"Optical Color Lens\" or \"Optical Lens\".  The cameras are plastic, and often have some sort of metal weight in the bottom to give them more heft, and therefore, the \"appearance\" of quality.  Make no mistake, there is not a lot of quality in these cameras, but they are pretty much on par with a Holga.  Some models have a chrome shutter release that accepts a remote cable, and all have a standard ISO flash shoe.  The viewfinder is just a window that gives you an estimate of what may appear in the frame.  Use a small auto flash, and you'll be able to shoot indoors.With my recently-acquired MVP camera, I was pretty sure that the shutter speed was around 1/100 sec., but in tests with the Phochron Shutter tester, the speed is around 1/250 - 1/300 second.  So, assuming you are following the sunny-16 rule, ISO 100-400 is fine for sunny days, as C-41 color film has a pretty wide exposure latitude.  I shot some 100 ISO Svema B&W film in my MVP camera, and on a sunny day the exposures looked just fine. Yes, that IS a Ford logo on the lens cap. I guess Ford had some promotion in the late 1980s.Are these serious cameras?Um, no.  Most of these cameras were given away in promotions.  Some factory (or factories)  in Taiwan must have made millions of them during the 1980s.  While yes, they are cheap and inconsistent in quality, they are a lot of fun.  You can find series 6 filter adapters (48mm)  that push into the front of the lens that allow you to use filters, providing you with even more possibilities.  It's too bad that these cameras don't have a B setting, since they do have tripod sockets.  Nonetheless, your results may be somewhat dreamy, they may resemble a Holga image, or may just be low-contrast and somewhat blurred -- it all depends on the camera.  McKeown's 12th edition lists the TIME camera as a \"minimum-quality 35mm camera from Taiwan.\"  The 2006 \"value\" is listed at $1-$5, which is pretty much unchanged today.What to look forSince these plastic cameras are becoming less common, they have also become somewhat collectible (low-end collectibles, at that.)  Due to them being offered in promotions, there are a variety of logos printed on the front, but there are basically just a few \"typical\" models that share the same features. The appearance of a grip on the right side was a good thing, enabling better holding of the camera.TIME - The Time camera was a 1985 promo camera from Time-Life to induce people to subscribe to the magazine. I am sure there are several camera variations, and the best examples will have the \"LAVEC OPTICAL GLASS LENS.\"  That should be a minor improvement over the \"color optical lens.\"   One variant of the Time camera is actually branded LAVEC, produced by Lavec Indsutrial Corp., Taipei, Taiwan.  In fact, a Google image search turns up a slew of cheap plastic cameras with Lavec branding.  The MVP camera shown here is also branded as a \"YUNON\" camera.  There are all kind of variants of this main theme.HACKING - One site - Instructables - has a page on hacking the Time camera, and while the ideas there are worth exploring if you have more than one of these cameras, the best thing one can do is put a 48mm diam filter adapter on the front so that you can use any number of filters that are suitable for the effect you want.  The double -exposure feature would be the one thing that would appeal to quite a few people. These cameras are also easy to hack if you want to put a vignetting mask in the back, or even make the frame mask 24x24mm.  Easy to to with black tape or cardstock.There is another class of cheap plastic 35mm cameras that attempt to fool people into thinking they are getting a modern auto-focus camera with a big \"pro-style\" flash.  They are usually branded with names like Canon, Olympia, etc., that sound like a legit brand, but alas, they are not.  I have not used any of them, but I know a few people that have, and they pretty much give the same results as the Time cameras, but with more bulk. Also, these counterfeits are made in China, not Taiwan. They usually show up at flea markets in showy packaging. Alas, they might be worth $5, but not more.  Of course, there are plenty on eBay.  I suspect that the \"single-use\" cameras that appeared and proliferated  in the 1990s was the end for these Taiwanese cameras.  While there are other promotional cameras, they just don't exude the cheesiness of the Time-style cameras. To summarize -- the Time-style cameras can be a lot of fun, and a way to get a Holga-like experience in 35mm.  Because of their size, you can have several in a bag with different films, ready for the next adventure.  Used within their parameters, you'll get images that are certainly different from your typical 35mm camera.  They are cheaply-made, in several styles that emulate a small SLR or a rangefinder. Don't pay more than a few bucks for one.  Have fun!My first results with the MVP, using Svema 100 ISO b&w film."},

Then, I found one for $3.00 at the Kiwanis sale, and picked it up.  I have always been intrigued by the looks of the camera, as it has a toyish, non-threatening appearance.  Of course, it is also water-proof, at least to a depth I would be happy with (no more than 6 feet), and is therefore perfect for canoe trips, rainy days, and the shore.  I thought it might also be good as a street camera, and as you know by now, I am always looking for a good, but cheap \"street camera.\"  Based upon the quietness of the camera, its toy appearance, auotofocus, autowind, and the somewhat wide-angle 32mm f/3.5 lens, I would think it's a good candidate. But, what about the photos?I took it along on Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day and shot a roll of Kentmere 400.  Results were fine, and right now I have a roll of Fuji 64T chrome film in it.Caveats - it uses DX codes to set the ISO, so no hand-loaded cassettes unless they have an DX code on them. No external flash ability. Best at objects over 1 meter away.

This year, it was a gloomy, cold, and then rainy day. Despite that, I felt we made the best of it, as we met on the University of Michigan campus. There is no lack of possibilities using pinhole cameras there.   I used my ONDU 6x9 pinhole camera for the first time, and realized that partway through the first roll, I had loaded the film on the wrong side, as the film spool should be loaded on the right side, not the traditional left side.  Therefore, the frame numbers will be proper for 8 6x9 images. Duh.  I should have realized that by looking at the arrows on the top of the camera.  With that out of the way, everything worked fine and I feel I got some good images.  Tim and Kat were also there, and always have been stalwart pinhole day attendees.Since it was graduation weekend, we saw quite a few UM grads there, especially around the Carl Milles fountain.  From there, we went over to Nickels arcade, and then over to Regents Plaza.  I have always wanted to photograph the cube while it was rotating, and the pinhole camera surprised me with the result. From there, we went over to the UM Law Quadrangle and got some shots in, at least until it started to sprinkle. After that, we headed home!The rotating cube.and.. now for the pinhole result.Inside Nickels Arcade Carl Milles fountain. About a 20 second exposure.one last video..."},
{"title": "Chicago's Central Camera - They Do Film Right", "date": "Wednesday, April 19, 2017", "text": "Last weekend, my wife and I visited Chicago together for the first time in many years.  We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton, a most fantastic classy hotel that has been in operation longer than any other hotel in the USA.  While I didn't plan the trip, it just so happened that Central Camera is a block away on Wabash.  Central Camera is equally as qualified for a longevity award as Palmer House.  I last shopped there in 2002, and bought a Tamrac backpack, which I still have.  Since then, I have been able to photograph the front of the store during quick Chicago visits, but it was always on Sundays, so it was closed.  This time, I stopped by on a Friday afternoon and a Saturday morning.  They open at 8:30, which is when I stopped by after breakfast Saturday. The nice thing about getting there early - is to be able chat with the folks behind the counters.First of all, Central Camera is the photo store that is so archetypical of  the genre. Old-school, with glass cases filled with used gear (and new) that will induce a severe case of GAS.  All kinds of delectable cameras and accessories.  Of course, they have digital gear, too. If they don't have it, you can have them order it.  They have film. Lots of film. I haven't seen that much film in a store -- ever.  They also process film.  Vivian Maier used to buy her film there, too.   I am sure she didn't chat up the folks at the counter, though.I bought s bunch of Kentmere 400 b&w, and some C-41 film while I was there. I don't NEED any more cameras, and it's a good thing I don't live in Chicago, or they would be getting a lot more of my money. Speaking of film -- Yes they DO film. Katherine Greenleaf and Charles Ezaki at the film counter.I had a good time talking with the folks there, and told them about the Film Photography Podcast.  I hope they listen in.  Stores like Central Camera are few and far between these days, and to walk into the store is to feel like it's a place that is welcoming and also a bit like a piece of history.  Yes, you can buy the latest digi item, but I'll bet that they have a lens hood that will fit that vintage Contaflex in your bag, too.   I know that if I were doing photowalks in Chicago, Central Camera would have to be a stopping point -- or maybe a starting point.   Anyhow, it was fun to shop there and talk photography.  It was just a year ago that I visited another iconic place -- Looking Glass Photo in Berkeley, CA.  Definitely a difference between the two locales, but no difference in their love of film photography.  You have to be passionate and knowledgeable about what you sell, and they have the right folks there. So, if you are in Chicago, check out Central Camera. It's a destination, and a shrine to all things photographic."},
{"title": "Some Aged Scotch ", "date": "Tuesday, April 11, 2017", "text": "Several weeks ago I received some 35mm film to test.  My contact at Ultrafine Online sent me a couple of rolls of Scotch ATG 400 C-41 film.  I was of course, intrigued, and there was some speculation that it may be the same film stock as the recently released Lomography F2/400.    From Ultrafine's web site is the description of the Scotch ATG 400 film:\"This is a rare film and this series was unique from back in the day as Scotch was trying to set themselves apart from the field and did some R & D, which mainly resulted in this ATG Series of films, which were originally meant to assist with underexposure and exposure compensation. This has resulted as the film has aged to a nice tone, which has been a favorite among Lomophiles, Holga shooters, and dedicated film shooters, who love have fun, shoot film, and experiment with different types of emulsions.\"The ATG 400 film was tested by Popular Photography back in 1993, and came in behind 400-speed films from Kodak, Fuji, Konica and Agfa beating it out.  However, the review by Michael McNamara \"400 Revolution\" [Pop.Photo. September 1993, pp. 28-37] tested a number of attributes of these films, at a time when 400 ISO C-41 films offered users many choices.  Interestingly, almost all of the results looked best at ISO 200, but in most cases, acceptable results were obtained between ISO 50 and 800. The Scotch film was the lowest-priced emulsion, and was designed to have better rendition in the shadows. From 9/1993 Popular PhotographyOkay, this film has been in Ultrafine's freezers for a while, so I knew that I wasn't going to shoot it at ISO 400. I figured it was worth a try to shoot it at 200 and hope for the best.  I loaded up my Pentax K1000 with the 55mm f/2 lens, and shot the roll on an overcast dreary day inside Matthaei Botanical Gardens. I figured it would offer me plenty of color and I could photograph things I am very familiar with.I processed the film last night using the Unicolor C-41 kit.  It was fresh, and I had only put 2 rolls through the 1-liter kit since I mixed it up.  Processed as normal.  When I took the film off the reel I thought perhaps it had not even developed as the emulsion side looked brown.  However, after drying, the film has a noticeable blue base, and the emulsion side looked \"normal.\" Results?  I am thrilled with the results from this film.  It has a soft grainy look that is pleasant.  It makes me wish the weather was warmer and I had a model outdoors.  It would really be interesting to see how it would do for portraits and figures.  I chose well picking ISO 200. 100 may be even better, so I'll try that next time for part of the roll.  Reds looked red, the shadows were not too bad, and while I think the greens are muted, tending a bit blue, it could also be the muted light that day. Full sun would be the next challenge.Here are some scans from the negatives. Minimal post-processing has been done, and there may be dust spots that I have not cleaned up. So, I am impressed with the results from this forgotten film. Maybe like whiskey, aging does it good. At $3.95/roll it's cheaper than vintage Scotch. You may want to give this film a try.  I don't think it's the same as the  Lomo F squared/400 film.  The Scotch film is probably close to 20 years old."},
{"title": "I Got a Sprocket Rocket in My Pocket", "date": "Thursday, April 06, 2017", "text": "Back in February, I purchased a Lomography Sprocket Rocket from my long-time Flickr and IRL friend, Trish.  I don't know why I had not bought one earlier, as they came out in 2012-- but I suppose they looked too much like one of those really cheap, shitty 127 cameras from the 1940s.  However, the similarity ends there.   The Sprocket Rocket takes 35mm and has a frame size of 24x72mm, and if you remove the mask, it also exposes the sprocket area (hence the name).  It's actually a sizable camera, with an all-plastic body and large front housing which contains the 30 mm f/10.8 lens.  The shutter is B and I, and the camera has two focus settings - 0.6-1 meter, and 1 meter to infinity.  The sunny setting is f/16, and cloudy-flash is f/11 (or close to it). There is a tripod socket on the bottom, so those bulb exposures will be a little easier.My camera was missing the mask that covers the sprocket area, but it makes no difference, as I scan only the 24mm width, anyways.  In use, the camera is quite simple.  When advancing the film, wait for the white dot to show up in a window next to the frame counter.  When you see it, you have advanced the film to the next 24x72mm frame.  To rewind, you simply wind the film back into the cassette - there is no button to release for rewind.  The back snaps off and on fairly securely, but I also use some black electrical tape to make sure there are no accidental openings.I shot one roll of color, which I have yet to develop, and just developed a roll of b&w Eastman 5222 film that I shot in Dexter and Chelsea, MI.  Some scans are below.  Overall, I am pleased with the results  which are far better than I expected.  The camera fills a niche which is generally an expensive one -- a true panorama 35mm camera. The 24x72mm frame is pretty well exposed, from corner to corner. There is some distortion, but it's part of the Lomography realm. I guess my original reaction to the camera as a cheaply-built and overpriced Lomography product was wrong.  I don't know of any camera that does what this one does at this size and price.  It's a lot of fun, and I look forward to taking it on a bunch of trips this year."},
{"title": "First Impressions - Lomography's New F2/400 film", "date": "Monday, March 27, 2017", "text": "When the new F²/400 film from Lomography was announced back in February, I eagerly pounced and bought 10 rolls.  I liked the images that I saw in their advertisements, and still, given the history of the film, I was prepared to be disappointed.  The thing about color films, is no matter what one gets, the resulting developing, scanning and modification can be quite different from person to person. That's because we tend to adjust the colors to what we find most pleasing. My red may not be the red you like, etc. The history of the film -- from Lomography's site:\"In 2010, we bought the last ever Jumbo Roll of original 400 ASA film from some renowned Italian filmmakers. Then, ever the ones to experiment, we left the film to age like fine wine in oak casks in the Czech Republic. Thankfully, our crazy instincts were rewarded — seven years later, we went back to discover that this fantastic film still produces refined colors with a beautifully unique tone. It’s one-of-a-kind Color Negative with an X-Pro feel, and we’re so excited to share it with you! There’s a only a very limited amount of this film available, so make sure you don’t miss out.Lomography Tipster: If you would like to experiment different ISO, the Lomography Color Negative F²/400 film gives exciting results also with ISO 200. \"Obviously, if it came from Italy, this is old Ferrania/Solaris film.  I don't recall any experience with that, but hey, I figured that I would still give it a go. The ad colors showed the film as having more of a pastel appearance, with some trending towards blue in the neutral colors.  I loaded two cameras with the film -- my Nikon FM2N, and my Minolta XG-M.  The film in the XG-M was finished first, and I developed it in a fresh Unicolor C-41 kit from the FPP store. About half the roll was shot in New Jersey while at the FPP HQ, and the rest was shot in Ann Arbor and a new state park in Jackson Co., MI.  I rated the film at ISO 400, used Aperture-priority mode, and did not do any exposure compensation for the shots. I used an Epson V700 scanner to scan the negatives.The film base is a dark orange-red, and the frames looked uniformly overexposed to my eye.  As we know, scanning and post processing can do wonders,    The images did tend to have muted pastel colors, slightly bluish in the neutral colors, and a bit soft.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but I ended up tweaking every image to make them satisfactory to my taste, at least.  While the Lomo site says one can shoot it at 200 for exciting results, I think one should go the other way.  ISO 800 may be where this film really shines.  The roll in my Nikon is about half shot at 400, and I am going to do the rest at 800 and see what I get.  I'll post an uncorrected image from one frame first, and my corrected version after that. The remaining images all reflect my adjustments in Paint Shop Pro, reducing the exposure and in some cases, doing some auto local tone-mapping for a better effect.unadjusted image - straight scanadjusted to my likingand here we go...Judging by the indoor photos, this film could be easily rated at ISO 800.   I have used that XG-M many times, so I know it's not overexposing due to faulty metering.  My second roll will be additional data, for certain.  Okay, what do I think so far?  I'm on the fence.  I sort of like it, and the indoor image of Mike Raso is quite good.  I think a little underexposure might be good.    I also need to shoot it with more people as subjects and see how it goes. Of course, if you want a washed-out Lomo look to your images, this film is perfect.  As of this evening, I see that Lomography Color Negative F²/400 is still sold out, so my remaining stock is all I will probably have on hand.  If you have shot some, let me know your opinion, as well!"},
{"title": "Point and Shoot Review - Olympus Trip XB40AF", "date": "Sunday, March 26, 2017", "text": "front of the cameraThere are so many cameras that turn up for a buck or two at the thrift shop, and while I ignore many of the point and shoots, I'll occasionally buy one.   Last year, I picked up an Olympus Trip XB40AF Quartz Date 35mm camera.  It takes 2 AA cells for power -- the exposure system (however minimal it may be) and the flash need the batteries, and the film advance is also automatic.  Don't let the \"Trip\" designation trip you up.  White the original Olympus Trip was and still is an amazing point and shoot, the cheap descendants are not really noteworthy.  However, it's my duty to at least give one a try and report on my impressions.The camera switches on when you slide the lens cover away.  The wide-angle 27mm lens has a maximum aperture of f/6.3, which is hardly a benefit -- so it's pretty much similar to the simple Vivitar PN211 in that regard.  I am not sure how much automation is in the camera -- The flash operates in all conditions, and there is no way to turn it off in daylight.   The shutter speed is 1/100 sec. for everything.  The true-image viewfinder is large and certainly easy to see through. There is a tripod socket. The film chamber reads the film ISO 100-400.   Obviously, when indoors, it would pay to use ISO 400 film for a better flash coverage.  The film is automatically rewound when the end of the roll is reached. I think the camera was introduced in 2000, near the end of the 35mm film point and shoot era, when digitals started to replace that part of the market.back of the camera.So, I put in a roll of Svema 125 color C-41 film (my last, as it turns out).  Over the course of a year, I managed to finish the roll.  Mostly I used it while at Film Photography podcast recording sessions, since were are all close together, and the 27mm lens has a pretty wide field of view.I finished the roll in March, and home-developed in the Unicolor C-41 kit.  The Svema films lies flatter in the scanner than a woodchuck on the expressway.  Here are a few examples from the camera.So, how did the camera fare?  Considering that it's merely a cheap P&S without any sort of control, it did about as well as any wide-angle single-use camera.  The Trip on the name is a reminder that it's supposed to be used wherever you go.  However, it's not  that the camera is bad, it's just not worthy of the Trip branding.  It's certainly worth a buck, and will give adequate, but not super results - and better than say, a Diana 35mm.   Oh, and no I didn't activate the Quartz Date back.  That's just not needed."},
{"title": "First Impressions - Minolta Maxxum 5", "date": "Sunday, March 19, 2017", "text": "I have only used a Minolta auto-focus camera a few times in the past -- A neighbor wanted me to sell her Minolta Maxxum 7000 and lenses for her, so I tested everything out with a roll of film before I did so.  While that camera had something going for it when it first came out, it was slow and a bit clunky in the user interface, compared to modern AF SLRs.  I also have seen a plethora of used Maxxums of various types in thrift shops, etc., sitting there, forlornly waiting for a new owner.  As I recently tested a Maxxum QTsi and was quite pleased with the results, it is just a P&S camera.  Since then, I acquired a Minolta Maxxum 5 with a 24-85mm lens.  Once I put new batteries (2 CR-2) in it, it came to life.  It helped that it had a manual, since this is a feature-packed SLR.  It features eye-start, and just about every setting one might want to use in a film SLR camera.    I am not going to go into a full review of the camera's features and settings, since they are already online elsewhere. One thing that caught my attention right away -- this has to be the lightest, compact and full-featured SLR that I have used.  If you have small hands, this is a great choice for an AF SLR.  The controls are easily accessed, and the wheel in the front of the camera controls the aperture when you are in A mode, and other settings as you rotate the mode dial are managed via the wheel.   The lens focuses quickly and the camera is very responsive to the user. The Maxxum 5 is the top of the line in the compact SLR bodies, and the larger, more professional-quality Maxxum 7 and Maxxum 9 remain at the top of the Minolta AF SLR bodies, with features that rival and even surpass Nikon and Canon's top models.  However, the sun was setting on Minolta as the digi revolution was underway.  It's too bad, but on the other hand, you can pick up these SLRs for a fraction of what they originally cost, and the A-series lenses are rather inexpensive.  If you are looking for a auto-focus SLR and have no current investment in a system, take a look at the Maxxum 5, 7, or 9. I shot a few rolls of b&w film for my initial testing, and have no complaints.  The camera handles VERY well, and I enjoyed using it.Eastman 5222 filmEastman 5222 filmEastman 5222 filmEastman 5222 filmexpired Delta 3200 at 1600!expired Delta 3200 at 1600!expired Delta 3200 at 1600!"},
{"title": "A Look Through the Konica EYE", "date": "Tuesday, March 14, 2017", "text": "Half-frame cameras are few - and while the Olympus Pen models usually come to mind, other manufacturers produced some as well.  There was the Canon Demi, The Ricoh Auto-Half, The Agfa Optima Parat, the old Univex Mercury II, Yashica Samurai, The Soviet-era Chaika-2, and then, there was also Konica, with several models to choose from including an SLR that featured full and half-frame settings. I used to own an Olympus Pen D, but I rarely used it, and sold it after a few years -- long ago. It was totally manual, and it seemed to take forever to finish a roll of film.  Of course, there are other half-frame cameras out there that I have not mentioned, but Google is your friend.Half-frame cameras use 35mm film, but the negatives are 18x24mm, rather than 24x36mm.  Half-frame images are the same as the cine-film area.  So, a roll of 24 exposure-film will give you 48 half-frame negatives.  For cost-conscious photographers, half-frame is indeed a money-saver. If you had an Olympus Pen F SLR, you were carrying quite a good bit of photographic equipment.  It also allowed for making some quite compact rangefinders and zone-focus cameras.I recently obtained a Konica EYE, and the logo on the front looks like a text emoticon.  The camera has a clean design, not unlike an Olympus Trip 35, and has some nice features.Dial on the back of the camera to set the ISO, with the setting appearing on the top deckShutter speeds (auto-set) ranging from B (manual) to 1/30 to 1/800, with the 30mm lens having an aperture range of f/1.9 to f/16. Selenium cells around the lens control the metering - just like the Olympus Trip 35.Cold shoe with a PC-sync socket on the front of the cameraZone/scale focusing, no rangefinderISO settings from 10 to 400.The model I have is the EYE version 2, produced in 1964.

I could sense that the winding was having some problems -- as in perhaps tearing sprocket hols and overlapping frames. However, I persevered, and it went back to normally advancing the film. Other than that, the only thing I had to remind myself to do was to set the focus to the proper range.I developed the film in D-76, in a 1:1 ratio with water for a 10 minute developing time.   That usually works out well.  Looking at the negs, some looked over-exposed, and of course, there were a bunch of overlapped frames, just as I suspected.  Most of the images look pretty good, and I will try this camera once again with some different films. Since I roll my own cassettes, I will make them 30-frame rolls instead of 72!Here are some of the images - all taken on the UM campus.

We recorded a lot of podcasts, and they will resume March 15 (yay! I like listening to them as well.).While there, I had a lot of fun shooting film in the studio, doing the podcasts, and of course, checking out the donations. Mike made sure that we ate well, and those NJ diners are amazing. The time flew by and I had to head home on Sunday.  All I can say is that I am touched and pleased at how many people are getting back into film, and how others are trying it for the first time and enjoying the process.  The FPP is a conduit for our love of film to the world at large, and it seems more and more folks are enjoying shooting with film. One thing that we discovered while doing the shows (what show?) is that B&H lists the FPP as a place to donate your film cameras.  That was a great surprise to us, and if you find yourself with more gear than you need or want, the FPP Donation Program is a good place for your stuff.

{"title": "The Magic Square... The Bronica SQ-B", "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2017", "text": "There is something about shooting in square format - whether it's 35mm or medium format.  While one can crop an image to be square, it's the composition in camera that makes the difference.  For one, you don't have to worry about an image being in portrait or landscape mode -- it's all the same. I think the first camera that I owned that shot square format may have been an Ansco folder. Then, I acquired a Rolleiflex for $75 back in 2002.  There are a lot of fun little square-format cameras out there, too. Some use 127 film. Getting used to the advantages as well as limitations of a TLR was quite educational and opened up a new way of seeing for me.  In 2004 I bought a Mamiya 645E that was new at Adray Camera in Ann Arbor, and while I owned it for 6 years, I never was comfortable with it -- the boxy body was cumbersome for vertical shots. I also owned a Kiev 60 for a while, and that SLR was quirky, as the frame spacing wasn't predictable.  However, i did take some decent images with it. I bought a nice  Kowa Six, and that lovely camera was nice, but a bit fiddly. Later, I acquired a Hasselblad 500C, back when they were selling used for really cheap, and people were ditching their film cameras for the latest DSLR.  I sold the Mamiya 645, of course. I enjoyed using the 'blad and had a number of lenses for it, and for some reason, sold it all after I acquired a like-new Mamiya C330 Pro with 80mm and 135mm lenses in March 2014.  The Mamiya is a bit of a beast, but I do enjoy shooting with it, as it close-focuses, which is something the Rolleiflex could not do without a special diopter , etc.   Having full control of my exposure and focus is important, but then, a camera like the Great Wall SLR from China is pretty much the opposite -- I owned one for a few years, and while I got some images from it that were somewhere between a Holga and an Argoflex, I found that it sat on the shelf a lot, so I sold it for a bit more than what I paid for it. While I sometimes regret selling my Rollei, the Yashica A that I have had for quite a while takes satisfactory images, and I paid $30 for it. The Mamiya C330 is a great system camera, and I use it regularly. How many TLRs does one need? (Don't answer that!).At this point, you are wondering \"When is this guy going to get to the topic in the title?\" I'm getting to that. Really.  What this all leads up to is over time, I realized that I sometimes have a camera crush, and what I really want is to be able to use a certain camera for a bit, not necessarily own it.  I have had a sort of revolving door when it comes to square-format cameras. Last fall, I realized that the one camera system that I had NOT tried was a Bronica SQ (I have no interest in shooting any more 6x4.5).  I didn't really want to go and buy one, only to find that it wasn't for me, or it was okay but quirky.  I mentioned that I would just like to borrow one for a while on the Film Photography Podcast, and certainly never thought that anyone would take me seriously.  After all, the FPP gives cameras away, right?A few months ago, I received an email from an FPP listener, and he offered to loan me a Bronica SQ-B.  It had belonged to his sister, and he needed to have some work done on it, and after that he would send it to me to use for a while.  It arrived on February 18, and after unboxing it and checking it over, I looked online and found a manual. I had a 6V battery for it, and after getting used to the controls and layout, I loaded a long-expired roll of film and shot it at various settings, just to acquaint myself to the camera.  I tossed the exposed roll in the garbage, and loaded a roll of Verichrome Pan which I shot last weekend, along with a roll of Tri-X.  Those were developed the next night, and I am quite pleased with the results.First of all, the SQ uses an electronic shutter, so unlike the Hasselblad 500C that I once owned, you need a battery for the camera to work (so does my Pentax 6x7).  There is no metering with the SQ-B, just like the 'blad 500C. The SQ-B that I now have is fitted with a waist-level finder, which I do like, and of course, one can add a prism finder, just as with the 'blad.  The controls on the SQ-B remind me of the Mamiya 645E, which is fine.  I wasn't a fan of setting the shutter speed on the lens with the 'blad.  The SQ-B goes from 8 seconds to 1/500, and no B or T.  That works fine for me.  It fits easily into my canvas messenger bag with a compartment insert.   The film loading is familiar, and the use of the dark slide is also familiar, though sometimes results in a  \"doh!\" moment when I forget to remove it.   Using the camera with an external meter or just using sunny-16 (or the Black Cat Exposure Guide) is fine.  If I were shooting something complex, I might use my Pentax Spotmeter.  In any case, this is a fun camera to use, and I look forward to doing a lot of photography with it over the next few months.  Thank you for the loaner, David Lyon!A few images from my Sunday afternoon outing last week.

Since then, I have shot one roll of film in the QTsi, and can now say a bit more about the camera.If you are looking for a camera that you can control to whatever level you need to allow your vision, this camera is not it.  BUT, if you want a P&S camera that has the ability of an SLR to accurately frame an image and focus on the subject, the Minolta QTsi may be the camera for the job.The Minolta Maxxum series of cameras started with the Maxxum 7000 in 1985.  It was the first AF SLR with an in-camera lens motor, and started the A-mount series of lenses with contacts in the lens mount to control the lens from the body of the camera.  Other manufacturers shortly followed up with their own models.  It was also the end of Minolta's manual focus SLRs, with the last model being the X-700.  As Minolta progressed with the Maxxum line, they also changed the hot shoe flash connection from the ISO standard shoe to a proprietary Minolta mount.    In Europe, the Maxxum line became Dynax, so the Maxxum QTsi is the Dynax 303si.  Minolta made some great Maxxum camera bodies, as good or better than anything from Canon and Nikon, and certainly better than Pentax. However, their lower-end models were mostly plastics, just like the Canon Rebel series, and over time, Maxxums were never as popular as the big two.  The Maxxum 9 and Maxxum 7 models are amazing SLRs that never achieved the hoped-for market share, as Nikon and Canon were getting most of the business.  That brings us to the QTsi, which appeared in 2000, just at the dawn of the DSLRs. The QTsi was an attempt to produce an SLR that your grandmother could use, if your grandmother had only used an Instamatic, that is.  But rather than belabor its target audience, I'll look at what makes this an ideal camera for anyone that wants to get a photo without fiddling with controls. Compared to the typical P&S with a small aperture, and slow zooming, the QTsi came with a 35-80mm zoom with a variable-max aperture of f/4- f/5.6, which is certainly comparable to the kit lenses on cameras from the big two.  You can control the flash setting, the program mode, self-timer, and AF or M focus, and that is about it. No aperture or metering shows in the viewfinder, just a green dot for focus confirmation.  A perfect camera for the kids, by the way.  It's lightweight, easily handled, and accepts any Alpha (A-mount) lens.  So, I guess if you could pair the body with a 50mm  A-mount lens, it would be one of those cameras that would be great for street photography.  Just whip it out and shoot.  You can find the manual for the camera here.I put a roll of Kodak 200 color film in the camera and shot the roll within 24 hours.  I processed the film in the Unicolor C-41 kit (sold by the FPP store), and herewith are the results from the scans off my Epson V700.I can find no fault with the metering or the focus, and every shot was as good as I could expect.  Like any p&s camera, you do give up some creative control in terms of depth-of-field, aperture priority, etc.  However, if those are not of concern to you, this camera deserves a look.  Yes, I paid $4.50 for the one I found, and there are lots of them around, often without lenses.  They take an easily found battery, and require 2 CR-2 cells."},
{"title": "2017...The Film Strikes Back", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2017", "text": "With the recent, head-spinning announcement by Kodak to produce Ektachrome this year, I was not prepared for the release of a new (actually, old) monochrome film from Film Ferrania.  The sample images I have seen that were shot with it are really luscious, with a pleasing richness that you'll never get from a digital.  The 80 ISO is a nice speed, as not all of us want 400 ISO films for everything. Then, Bergger anounced that they will be releasing a 400 ISO b&w film, Pancro 400, which will be available in 35mm, 120, and 4x5! I am less familiar with Bergger, but I did know of their paper.  I wondered if the Bergger film the same as  the JCH Street Pan, which has had very good reviews, but the JCH film was made by Agfa.  I confess that I have not yet purchased any myself. So, with these announcements, is 2017 the year when film strikes back?  It is no secret that more people have come BACK to using film, for a multitude of reasons, but I believe the most obvious reason is that film is a creative medium.  In terms of market, digital has a large hold over traditional film. However, film remains strong among those that appreciate the art of photography, the sheer joy of the process, and being in control of your image.  Not to mention, that in a world where just about everyone takes photos, film remains a tangible, physical reality that transcends time and digital resources.  I got thinking about this when I scanned in some slides from the late 1970s that I had taken with my Exa 1a SLR.  Mind you, I was using slide film, sunny-16, and never had a meter of any sort. Yet, I have some pretty decent shots from then. I didn't need any software to view them in their plastic sleeves within the binder to appreciate them.  Scanning went well, and also allowed me to do a bit of color correction. Yet, the originals are safely tucked away.South Beech Street, Syracuse, NY Feb. 1978.Dave Rosher with his Spotmatic, summer, 1977.Adrienne, fall of 1978. I am not here to bash the digital realm -- it is a necessity of every-day communication, consumption, and path of ideas.  Without the internet and the invention of the magic of HTTP and its subsequent eruption of the web as we now know it, we would be back to using something like CompUServe (for those of you who do not know of a world without internet -- we got along just fine.)  We are a visual culture, and photography is an extension of that.  We can still use film and share online, share via printed works, share via exhibitions, and yes, share via Instagram if we so choose.I think it would also behoove the primary SLR manufacturers to rethink their marketing strategy.  While sales of DSLRs have dropped due to the smaller size and capabilities of the mirrorless cameras, smartphones have decimated point and shoot sales.  If Nikon, Canon, and Pentax were to release at least a decent 35mm SLR again, it would be a great thing.  All Nikon has to do is manufacture the F100 again-- certainly the best AF SLR that wasn't an F5 or F6.  Canon could produce an EOS film camera (not the plastic Rebels, please), and Pentax ought to have a K1000 made once again.  Do you know how many people think the K1000 is the best student camera ever?  It amazes me.  Yes, there are a lot of used film cameras available, but having a new model would certainly not be a bad thing. Look at what people will pay for a cheap plastic Lomography camera.  If Joe Blow spends $500 on a 120 Lomo LC-W, he'll spend $1200 for a new Nikon film camera. So, maybe it's time to have people petition the camera makers for new film cameras.  I don't know what more digital can offer anyone that it doesn't already.  Meanwhile, we have some new films to try out!Edit: After writing this post, I found this post by Zorki Photo, which is a very good article."},
{"title": "An Iron Horse and a Plastic Wonder", "date": "Wednesday, February 01, 2017", "text": "I briefly stopped by my local thrift shop this afternoon, and picked up a couple of cameras for less than $15.  A Nikon Nikkormat FTN body for $9.00, and a Minolta Maxxum QTsi in a bag for $4.50. Yes, I have paid far more for a sandwich than I did for the Minolta. I mean, $4.50 is less than even a pizza from Little Caesar's!The mighty Nikkormat FTNLet's take a look at the two.  Of course, I added a lens on the Nikkormat FTN for its portrait, because a lens-less SLR just looks pathetic.  I suspect the meter is suffering from a common malady that affects those old Nikkormats. It doesn't matter much, as $9 for a robust body that you can practically pound nails with is a great deal.  It seems to work great otherwise, and I will run some film through it soon.  I have always had a soft spot for Nikkormats. They are basic, no-frills Nikons that usually perform quite well. Now, in contrast, the Minolta QTsi is a much newer camera, dating from about 2000.  Plastic, yes. It's also about as point-and shoot an SLR can get.  You have various modes, no exposure compensation, and no manual anything (other than focus and selecting the flash mode) -- a real beginner's camera.  On the other hand, it's pretty goof-proof, and is a camera you could give to anyone and they can just shoot with it.  I told myself I was never going to buy any AF Minoltas, because I just don't need more cameras with a different lens mount. Well, for less than $5, I felt sorry for that camera, so I bought it, put in new batteries, and a roll of film.  I'll see how well it performs.  Back in 2000, Tony Sweet gave the camera a very nice  review.  It's no Maxxum 7, but it's still capable of getting some good images.   It weighs 12 ounces.  It is by far, the smallest AF SLR I have held.  Yes, it is a glorified P&S, bit once I shoot a roll, I will have a better idea of its shortcomings. $4.50. I hope I didn't over pay :)"},
{"title": "In a Fog", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2017", "text": "In the literal sense.  The past two days have been wonderful for shooting in a dense fog.  While it is late January, it feels like March, as the temperatures have been mild for this time of year. The fog yesterday lingered until the sun burned it off around noon, but today's hung around quite a bit longer. One of the fun things about shooting in these conditions is the soft light, and the muted details. Forms become important, rather than the details, and such weather just screams for b&w, or at least it does for me. With the backgrounds obscured by white, it becomes a dreamland where you really can't quite pin down where an image was taken. I shot mostly film yesterday with my Nikon FG and 50mm  and 36-72mm E lenses.   I took along my Fuji X100S digi, and therefore have some lovely b&w scenes to share right away. Today, I was running errands, and stopped along the Huron River, again with the X100S. The scenes I was seeing reminded me of some Japanese woodblock prints.  With such a serene, soft landscape, one can lose those negative thoughts and live in the moment.  It was a needed break offered to us by nature."},
{"title": "Nikon Series E Lenses", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2017", "text": "The FG and its Series E lens family,Yesterday I walked into Camera Mall, and found a couple of Series E Nikkor lenses I had on my \"want list.\"  For $25 each, I took home a Series E 35mm 2.5, and a 100mm 2.8.  Both in good condition, and this first portrait shows my Series E \"family\" - The 50mm 1.8, 35mm 2.5, 100mm 2.8, 36-72mm 3.5, and 75-150mm 3.5. This of course, brings up the typical conversation, which goes something like this:  \"Those Series E lenses aren't the greatest, but they'll do.\"   or, \"The Series E 50mm is compact, but it's not very durable.\"  or, \"That 100mm series E is nowhere as good as the 105mm Nikkor.\"I'd like to address the mythology of the Series E lenses. First of all, I will concede that they are lighter, smaller, and are certainly not built like the \"pro\" lenses. Nikon glass for the most part, has been top-notch, with few exceptions.  The Series E lenses were made in the late 1970s and early 1980s to be smaller, lighter, and less expensive so as to bring options to photographers with less money to spend. They did not have the \"bunny ears\" to accommodate non-AI cameras, such as the F2, because it is a \"pro\" camera. So these are true AI lenses for the Nikon SLRs such as the FE, FM, FA, FG, and EM, and of course, AF cameras such as the F100.  The series of photos here illustrate the paired lenses such as the 50 f/1.8 Series E and the Nikkor 50mm f/2. I'll talk about each of them briefly.  I don't have the 28mm Series E lens, so that one will be left out.35mmThis focal length has often been felt to be the best for street photography -- just a little wider than 50mm, but also a good estimate of what our eyes see.  The two lenses here, the Series E 35mm f/2.5 is certainly much smaller and lighter (160g) than the Nikkor-O 35mm f/2 (285g), which dates from about 1965, and was AI-modified by John White much later.  The E lens dates from around 1980.  I have used the older lens a lot, and it produces excellent results, especially when stopped down.  It should be used with the matching 35mm lens hood, as that front element is a lot of glass, close to the front of the lens. The E version is reputed to be a fine lens optically.50mmThe 50mm has always been considered the go-to focal length by many photographers, and it's the lens that almost always came with your SLR, no matter the manufacturer.  Before cheap zooms became \"kit lenses\", these were the kit lenses.  There are a bunch of 50mm Nikkors, and while the f/1.4 is a desirable lens for indoor and low-light, as well as shallow DOF, the \"standard\" 50mm f/2 reigned from 1959 to 1979 in different versions.  The 50mm f/2 is renown for its relative flat field, close focus distance, and does well with extension tubes and bellows. However, it has a minimum aperture of only f/16.  The lens shown here weighs 210g.  In comparison, the E lens has a maximum aperture of f/1.8 and a minimum of f/22, and weighs 155g.  I have shot a lot with different E versions, and I will say that stopped down to f/4 and lower, results are fine. It IS compact, and in a camera such a Nikon FG, it makes for a good combo of light weight and compactness.  Is it a great lens?  I'll bet it depends a lot on your expectations and subject matter.  Don't dismiss it though. 100mm - 105mmI consider the 100-105mm focal length a good one for portraits, nature, and as it's a short telephoto, a good match with extension tubes for nature close-ups.  Even on the street, it's a good lens for isolating your subjects.  The Series E lens, 100mm f/2.8, has a very good reputation, and I shot the image of the Nikon FG and FM with their 50mm lenses with the 100mm E lens on  my Nikon D200.  The E lens is noticeably smaller and lighter than the 105mm f/2.5 Nikkor (220g vs 470g) with its built-in lens hood.  Both are excellent lenses, but I would say if you are going on a trip, the E lens will be appreciated due to its compactness and weight advantage over the 105.ZOOMSIt was harder to compare the zooms, but the closest I can come to the 36-72mm f/3.5 Series E is the cheap 35-70mm f/3.3-4.5 zoom which features a zoom collar and a separate focusing collar.  Yes, there are other 35-70 zooms, but I have not tried the other manual-focus ones.  In this case, it's the Series E lens that is larger and heaver (380g vs. 255g).  I have shot quite a bit with my E lens, and while it is a constant aperture-zoom, I think stopped down to f/5.6 produces better results than wide-open.  It is a far better lens, in my opinion, than the 35-70, due in part to being a one collar zoom and focus. 75-150mmI don't have a \"twin\" to compare to, but I have shot with this lens quite a bit, and results have been very good.  Pop on an extension tube or a 2T accessory lens, and it's great for flower close-ups, etc.  The lens weighs 519g, and is 12.5 cm long.  According to Moose Peterson (The Nikon System Handbook, 2000), the 75-150 was \"the\" lens for fashion work, especially in the studio. I consider it to be an excellent lens to have in the bag.The beauty of the E lenses is that all take the standard 52mm filters, making filter use quite simple.  I recommend lens hoods for best results (I know it's a thing with me, but they help all lenses).If you are going on a trip, carrying the 35mm, 50mm, and the 100mm won't be a big deal with a body such as the FG, FE, or FM.  Or, the 36-72mm plus the 100mm if you only want to carry two lenses.taken with the 100mm E lensI am not saying Nikon lenses are by far the best, because that is an un-provable statement.  The manual focus Nikkors have been around a long time, and I think the true value of a lens to me is -- does it produce an image that I am happy with, and does it work consistently?  While the E lenses have been saddled with the \"not as good a build\" statement, remember that these lenses are now over 35 years old, and most are probably working well.  You can chase unicorns for that mythical best lens, or learn to use your equipment and know how to get the most out of what you have.  That may seem hypocritical coming from a gear guy like me, but I see people arguing over the fact that a certain lens is better because it has an aperture of f/1.2 vs f/1.4.  If you NEED to shoot at f/1.2, it is the best lens to do that with, but it does not mean it's a better lens than the mundane 50mm f/2 Nikkor. Over the years, I have accumulated quite a few Nikon lenses, and also sold off a few as well. I had a 180mm f2.8 ED lens for quite a while, and though it certainly is a very good lens for isolating a subject due to the shallower DOF, I found that the sheer bulk of the lens outweighed its utility to me, and sold it last year when I needed to fund a Pentax 6x7.  A zoom lens that I think is really very all-around useful is the 35-105mm f/3.5-4.5 Zoom Nikkor.  It can focus at around 10 inches in the \"macro\" setting.  If you had that lens and a 50mm f/2, you would be set for most things on a trip. I'll close with this photo of my current stable of manual Nikkors, though I now see I forgot the 45mm f/2.8 GN-Nikkor, because it was on a camera.  I have multiple 50mm f/2 lenses, and I love them all, especially the older non-AI versions. They are superbly-made lenses."},
{"title": "Big News... Ektachrome is back!", "date": "Sunday, January 08, 2017", "text": "my last roll of Ektachrome* in the fridgeUnless you have not been anywhere on the internet in the past week, you have undoubtedly heard the unexpected announcement by Kodak Alaris at the Consumer Electronics Show regarding the resuming of production of Ektachrome by Eastman Kodak later this year.  Yes, this IS a big deal.  It's rare for a manufacturer to reintroduce a discontinued product, let alone a film stock.  I hope the hype pans out, and that people buy this film -- a lot of it, in fact.  One may wonder why they would do this.  Well, since it is a color-reversal film, development results in a positive image, which translates well for the 16mm movie market.  It's a niche, for sure, but so is Super-8, which also would benefit from this.  I think the still-photography folks will also appreciate having another option, too.Up until now, Fuji has been the only manufacturer still offering slide film.  Their Fuji Velvia 50 and Velvia 100, and Provia 100 and Provia 400 films are terrific, and if you are shooting nature, those films are perfect.  Meanwhile, Ferrania is trying to restart their factory, and until they actually produce a product (and I think they will), it is just what we used to call \"vaporware\" in the software industry.  Eastman Kodak, however, has the facilities, the formulas, and the expertise already in place, so I fully expect Ektachrome 100 to appear this fall.  I would love to be one of the first people to get samples!I also think that the continuing interest in shooting film has played a role (many many rolls!) in this decision.  Lomography has been selling slide film, which I believe is remaining stocks of Kodak Ektachrome, and perhaps Fuji, as well. The only way to tell is to look at the film box, which will state where the film was manufactured (USA = Kodak, Japan=Fuji).  Even the so-called Agfa Precisa is rebranded Fujichrome (correct me if I am wrong).  While I question how much slide film will be used in the commercial realm, the enthusiast market is growing again, and a smaller, more efficient Kodak operation can fill that niche.I don't want to count the number of rolls of slide film (aka \"color reversal film\") I have shot in 45 years of photography.  I did however, take a glance through some of my files of slide images, and I can see where I shot a ton of Fuji Astia and Provia, Kodak Kodachrome, and to a lesser extent, Ektachrome.  I pondered about that for a bit, but I suspect it was most likely due to price, and film specials, etc.  It may also have been cyclical -- I can see where I shot a lot of Ektachrome in a given year.  Of course, in the last decade, any slide film I shot was primarily whatever I could find and it usually was not the same kinds of subjects what I was shooting in the early 2000s.  Back then, I was doing a lot of nature and macro photography.  That's primarily what I use digital for now.  For me, street, architecture, and colorful subjects--slide film is a pretty darn good medium.  The trouble is, the local E-6 labs died off, and I had to send it out, and the development price was about $12/roll, including the postage.  So, of course, until more recently, I shot very little of it.  Now that I can do E-6 at home with the Unicolor kit, my price of development of a roll is about $3.   As a result, I am more likely to shoot more E-6 in the coming months.  I have been shooting the Retrochrome 320 from the FPP store, and while I like it, it is expired Ektachrome of some sort.  So again, having a true ISO 100 slide film from Kodak will be greatly appreciated.If you have not ever shot slide film in 35mm or 120, you might ask \"why all the fuss?\"  There is something quite magical about holding a \"chrome\" in your hand.  The bigger the format, the more outstanding the positive color image.  You do not need an intermediary process to see the image (i.e. a negative needs to be scanned  or printed to see the positive image.  With a color reversal film, it's all there right in front of you.So, to Kodak, I say, bring it on!!*Elite chrome was the consumer version of professional Ektachrome.  Under the Kodak Professional branding, we had Ektachrome 100G, 100VS, etc.  The all-purpose Elite chrome 100 was a good film, and the edge markings are EB100.   You can find out more about the various types of chrome films here.   If you are interested in seeing a lot of Ektachrome shots online, visit the Flickr Ektachrome group."},
{"title": "Projects can keep you fresh.", "date": "Thursday, December 29, 2016", "text": "Day 8 of \"Solstice to Solstice\"It's just about the end of the year, and while 2016 has seen its share of bizarre events, disasters, celebrity deaths, and potential end of life as we know it-- on a personal note, I can't complain.  The bigger picture is beyond my sphere of influence, and rather than let fear and/or anger lead my way, I have to do what I know best, and that's to do photography.  I'm not an \"event photographer\" nor am I an \"adventure photographer.\"  My work is more often introspective, about nature, slivers of life and places, and of course, a lot of it is on film.  If you look through my images on Flickr, where I have been since 2004, you'll have a pretty good idea of what I photograph.  Probably over a  third of the images there are on film.   I continue to shoot it a lot -- in fact, I think 2016 might just be the year that I have shot well over 100 rolls - close to 130.   Developing my own C-41, E-6, as well as B&W has saved me a lot of money -- which of course, can be used to buy more film!So, with all the film have I shot, what have I done with it?  I have long-term projects that accrue by the fact that the subjects are easily grouped -- Michigan post offices would be one such project. Recurring images of water in various states would be another, and while I had an exhibit in 2102 of winter water images, there are always more.  Sometimes, a single roll can be a small project, and that is always a fun challenge.  I feel that it's good to have some goals and  projects to keep one engaged, no matter what your endeavor. I rarely announce a photography goal, but this year, I am doing a \"Solstice to Solstice\" project, where I upload one image taken that day, from the Winter to the Summer Solstice -- basically, 6 months. That's not really a project I can do on film, and I decided to use just one camera for that, a Nikon D3200.  It's lightweight, takes different lenses, and while lacking features of my workhorse (and some may say outdated) D200, it allows me plenty of creativity.  So, on December 21, I shot and uploaded Day 1.  I hope to finish with consecutive images on Wed., June 21, 2017.  The idea that I have to produce an image for each day is challenging, and it has to be a worthwhile image.  Half a year's worth.  I think it'll be fun, sometimes frustrating, but I want it to be worth the effort.  I'll know in June.It's not a bad thing to set some goals, and I think it helps one grow as a photographer.  Maybe you would like to be better at doing portraits.  Learn about lighting, and experiment. Enlist friends or family to pose for you -- find out what your \"style\" is.  Maybe you'll find that b&w works better for you than color.  Or not.  You'll never know if you don't try. AuTrain Bay, Pentax 6x7, August 2016Take a single camera and lens combo and use it a lot.  We all get that \"gear-acquisition syndrome\" or GAS.  I'll be the first to admit it.  But what if you found that just using a 50mm lens or a 28mm lens for a lot of photography made you a better photographer?  Give it a try.  There are many \"projects\" one can do in 6 months. To go to the other extreme, shoot one Polaroid a day.  It's been done by many, but what about you? What story do you have to tell?  Six months of Impossible Project film might be pretty expensive though. Hell, one month of IP film would be expensive, so 6 months would be about $750.  Make those shots count!Since I have been on winter break (one of the perks of working at a university), I have had time to do some darkroom cleanup, mix up more C-41, and process a lot of color film.  Some of it dates back to June!   Scanning is going fine, and yes, while it takes time, I enjoy the results.

{"title": "Happy Holidays", "date": "Friday, December 23, 2016", "text": "You can't escape this time of year.  For me, the Winter Solstice is a time to reflect, to connect, and to look forward to longer days. It's no secret that the winter solstice held  much importance to ancient cultures, so much so, that Christianity ended up melding its celebration of the birth of Christ to the Roman Saturnalia and the Yule traditions.   However you celebrate the shortest days of the year, I wish you the best. I love the lights and many of the decorations and the general festiveness, and the food. Since this is a photography blog, I hope that if you were wanting that \"special\" photo item, you ended up getting it, or giving something to start another young photographer on his or her way.  In Christmas 1973, I received a new  Exa IIa, which cemented my love for photography.At one time, it seemed that a lot of people had a roll of 12 exposures in their Brownie that covered not one, but often, two Christmases.  Then Polaroids and Instamatics got them shooting a bit more frequently. Here is  a really dorky photo of me from Christmas, 1966, in which I am holding my prized G.I. Joe doll (ahem, they had not come up with the term action-figure as yet).  I was 10, so that was 50 years ago.  My cousin Brenda MacDonald was less than a year old.   Are cardboard fireplaces still a thing?

{"title": "It's that time of year!", "date": "Sunday, December 18, 2016", "text": "Card design by Samara PearlsteinWhen the snow starts falling, my photographic output falls a bit, until I get my mindset aligned with the change of seasons.  First of all, doing any photography in the winter can be a challenge, depending on the severity of conditions.  There are factors that work against you, aside from getting cold fingers. Keep your gear from getting wet. Snow can cause havoc -- and if you are in a snowstorm, you really don't want it on your lenses.  An easy way to keep the snow off the front element is to just use a skylight filter on the front. It will making cleaning it off a lot easier.  Use a soft cloth, such as a piece of an old t-shirt to wipe off the snow or condensation. A micro-fiber cloth for fogged lenses usually works pretty well, and a lens hood also helps to keep snow from the front of the lens.Try to avoid changing lenses, but if you must, keep them wrapped in a cloth until you need them.  There are lens wraps available that protect lenses quite well.  Changing lenses in the cold weather with cold fingers is a good time to have a case of the fumbling fingers appear.Some cameras are just harder to use in the cold -- folding cameras are a good example. The bellows get stiff, controls fiddly, and so on.  All-metal cameras with small dials and metal lens barrels also may become difficult to use.  While I wear gloves or mittens with flip-away tips, my fingers get cold from handling equipment, and it helps to have a warmer in your pocket.  Carrying a tripod is another source of cold hands, so use some pieces of foam pipe insulation and tape them over the topmost leg section.  It really makes a huge difference.If it gets, really, really cold, you can strip the sprockets right off the film with a motor-drive.  If you are shooting film, I advise you to use as simple a camera as possible for below-zero conditions. A Nikon FM2N, Pentax K1000, or similar camera will be ideal.  If you are shooting digital, keep spare batteries inside your coat.  Nikon made an external battery holder (DB-2)  for the FM and FM2N and similar cameras-- it has two AAs with a long cord that screws into the battery compartment - keeping the battery inside your coat. Cold dry air can cause static discharge on the film as it is wound or rewound.  I have had that happen only once, and it wasn't all that cold.  It was an \"interesting\" effect on the negatives. So, another reason to wind slowly.  While I doubt that most of us would find ourselves in the Antarctic, under those conditions, film has simply shredded as it was wound.  So, under ultra-cold conditions, digital may be the better choice!I tend to shoot mostly nature scenes in winter, but street shooting has it rewards, too.  However, a pocket camera works well in winter, and something like an Olympus RC or Trip 35 is easy to use with gloves.  Holgas are great for winter, too.  Nothing much to adjust, and with some b&w film, those snow scenes could be even more interesting shot with a Holga.Keep your hands, feet, and head protected in winter. The rest will be fine if you do that.  The clothing available now for winter wear is amazing, and dressing in layers is still the best way to go about it.One last bit of advice -- experienced photographers already know this-- but remember to adjust your exposures for snow.  Generally, 1 to 2 stops more exposure than your meter is telling you.  Sunny-16 in winter is a wonderful thing.To close up, here are a few recent images that I shot on the FPP- Mr. Brown ISO 6 film.  It was snowing heavily, and I used a Canon EOS Rebel 2000 (all-plastic) at ISO 8.  The film was developed in XTOL 1:1 for 10 minutes.  I think the results are pretty good.The gray smudge at lower center is a walker in the woods.Long exposures!I turned 60 last Monday, so I better be getting my senior discount now, but unfortunately it does not apply to film purchases!  Stay warm, stay positive, and keep shooting film. I know that I will."},
{"title": "Konica Autoreflex TC...again.", "date": "Sunday, November 27, 2016", "text": "You would think that by now I would be able to see a lonely orphaned camera in a thrift shop without bringing it home.  I guess I am not there yet, if the price is right.  Yesterday I was at the Ann Arbor Recycle/Reuse Center (where I also purchased a like-new pair of Realistic Solo-1 speakers), and saw this dirty, yet working Konica Autoreflex TC for $10.  It had the wonderful 40mm 1.8 Hexanon AR lens.  I opened it up, and the inside was clean, the shutter speeds worked, so I figured I would buy it. Over the years, I have acquired a few of these cameras, and have donated them to the Film Photography Project. A few years ago, I had a bag full of Konica SLRs, and have since divested myself of all of them.  Yet, once again, a lonely, unloved Konica TC turns up.before cleaningToday, I cleaned the camera up.  It was filthy on the outside, but the glass on the lens is excellent, and the insides are clean.  My cleanup kit consists of a used soft toothbrush, industrial cotton swabs (the ones on a stick), an old t-shirt, lens tissue, and a bottle of isopropyl alcohol.  That usually handles just about everything, but sometimes a bit of Windex or Naptha is needed for stubborn dirt or sticky residue.  I removed the old camera strap, which was a custom one with the name of the former owner embroidered on it.  Although the Autoreflex TC originally required 2 PX-13 1.35V mercury cells, two 625A 1.5 cells will work fine, and you may not need to compensate via the ISO wheel.   I put in the 625As, and checked the metering against my Nikon N6006, and the reading in the TC was the same at ISO 400. Note -- you do not need batteries for the TC to function, except for the auto-exposure and metering.  If the batteries fail, you can use an external meter or sunny-16, and you adjust aperture and shutter speed manually. Otherwise, just set the lens to AE and set the shutter speed, and the camera will choose the aperture.  In other words, it is a Shutter-Priority and Manual camera.One of the things I find when rehabilitating old cameras is that the light seals and mirror-bumper  usually need replacing. In the Autoreflex TC, I cannot see the mirror bumper, as there is a thin plastic or metal shield at the top behind the lens.  The light seals on the back seemed to be good enough to at least shoot a test roll.after cleanup!Using the Autoreflex TCI look at the TC as being a compact Autoreflex T, hence the TC.  It's definitely lighter than a Autoreflex T, T2, etc., and is smaller than a Pentax K1000.  Plastic components obviously keep the weight down.  While the TC has a limited range of shutter speeds from B, 1/8- 1/1000 sec., it's a good street camera.    The camera has a standard hot shoe and PC socket for flashes, with a 1/125 sec sync speed.  In other words, while it's not everything you might need in a small SLR, it has what you will need in most situations.  In fact, it's a pretty decent \"student camera.\"  One other tip on using the camera -- do not try to pull up on the film rewind to insert a new roll of film. The bottom is cut out a bit so a roll just fits right in. The rewind knob only rotates to rewind the film, and there is no vertical movement. The meter turns on when you move the wind lever away from the body. A button below it sets the lever back against the body, locks the shutter release, and turns off the meter.  Of course, if you need a manual, our friend Butkus has one. Be sure to donate some $ to his site to keep those manuals available."},

It's not like there are inexpensive items they can use except for film, right? And, hell, where does one even buy film? Film photographers love to show that they love film, sort of like sticking up a certain finger to the all-digital crowd.    So, we love t-shirts, hats, pins, stickers, etc. to show off our passion about film.  I have put together a short list of small businesses that cater to EXACTLY people like me. And you, if you are another analog camera user. Asilda has cute pinsI am a fan of the Asilda Store, as the small enamel pins sold featuring cameras and slogans are really well-made, subtle, and classy.  The pins are wonderful small gifts for any photographer. They look good on a lapel, camera strap, or hat.  Asilda also sells photography-themed patches.   I found their prices to be very reasonable, so check them out!from ShootFilmCoMike Padua, owner of ShootFilmCo, has a wonderful array of patches, stickers, and other items for the photographer. You may want to check out his photo memo books, which are a recent addition to his store. I have several of his stickers on my car, and I love the smart designs he comes up with. The patches are well-made, too. The photo memo books are ideal for recording your exposures, notes, etc. while out shooting.  It may be a chore for some to write this stuff down, but if you want to know what you did on frame x,  they will prove to be quite helpful after you process your film and wonder what you did shooting away all day.Nick Mayo, out in western Michigan, started up  Two Stops Apparel this year. I like his choice of items, and I am sure that he will continue to produce humorous and well-appreciated t-shirts, etc. for us folks.  As illustrated by T. Paul Wrobel, if you wear this shirt, you will never forget the order in which to process your roll of film.T. Paul with a shirt from Two Stops ApparelThe Film Photography Project Store also has a number of stickers, as well as a classy T-shirt that photographers will like -- and their prices are very good.  You may also want to check out some of the films and other items that are offered.  Nothing beats a few rolls of film in the stocking!Of course, there are other on-line places like Photo Jojo that cater to all photographers, and you will find something if you just Google it!    I like to support these smaller businesses, and they produce quality products, and their niche fits in with those of us already in a niche - analog photography.As for me, I pretty much have all I need, except for that Bronica SQA.

A:  Stay away from cameras that have a film cassette window on the back, and if they use IR inside for figuring out frame counts, like the Canon EOS cameras.  Time to go back to basics, and use something like a Pentax K1000, Nikon FM2N, Canon FTb, Minolta X700, etc.  You definitely want the camera to do the metering.  Of course, you could also use a rangefinder camera.Q: Where do I send it to be developed?A: Unless you are doing your own E-6 developing, the only place I recommend is thedarkroom.com in California.  They are used to dealing with it, and after I sent a couple rolls to another lab with awful results, I wish I had sent them to The Darkroom.   The film isn't cheap, so don't mess it up.Every time I shoot a roll of this film I am amazed by the results. It's also a learning process, as every time, the conditions, subject,  and time of day give me results that are often surprising.   What really work -- strong afternoon sunlight, lots of vegetation, and a few clouds really add to the image.Here are a few examples form the FPP Infrachrome film."},
{"title": "Binders Full of Memories", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2016", "text": "I have spent some time this past week doing a lot of decluttering and cleaning of my spaces where I work at home.  Upstairs, where I do some of my scientific work -- identifying insect specimens and writing-- didn't take too long because it's pretty well organized, but the cleanup sure did make a difference, and allowed me to be more focused on projects that I have been delaying.  Downstairs, though, is where most of my photography-related activities and storage take place.  It's amazing how things can get out of hand after a while.  I had put off inserting my Print-File pages of negatives into the binder for this year, and it looks like I will be going well over 100 rolls of film shot/developed for 2016. That's a fair amount of negatives. Some of course, are test rolls in \"new\" cameras, or are test rolls of films I had not shot before.  However, the majority of the images are certainly pretty worthy stuff. The thing I want to stress here is that these are physical objects, not files on a hard drive or CD. I am able to hold the sheet up to the light and immediately know what I am looking at.  It would be easy to have 5000 images on a drive somewhere and never look at them again, or at least forget about.  Not so with binders full of negatives, or boxes of photographs. As I was decluttering and moving things around,  and tossing some stuff into the garbage, and putting other items into a box for recycling/donations, I thought about the binder after binder with 35 mm slides that were on the shelves.  At one point, I took one binder off the shelf and most of the slide pages fell out, forcing me to look them over for a bit.  Another binder had slides that I used in a presentation in the early 1980s.  Since all of them were reproductions of line art from publications (remember the blue  \"diazo\" slides?), they went into the trash.   I went back to the pile of pages that had fallen out from the first binder, and set them aside for working on later.  I'll need to re-examine them closely, and determine the ones are worth saving.  Most of them are from the early 1980s, and are documenting the Botanical Gardens collections.  A few are probably worth scanning and putting online.  A bunch will be tossed because frankly, my photographs were not that good.  Transparency film does not tolerate bad exposures. As I have gone over some of my old files of transparencies, I have also realized that it's only in the past 10 years that I would say that I have become a pretty decent photographer.  Not about technique (improved, certainly) so much as it is about subject and motivation.  I know I see better now, and I don't mean my eyesight.  That translates to more images that have something to say.old slides in vinyl sleeves, not archivalBack to my cleaning up. Keeping images secure and findable is important.  It is a problem when you have piles of negatives and haven't properly stored them.  If you are spending the time and money to photograph, take the time to at least store your negatives or slides in the Print-File archival pages, label them with at least the date and place they were taken. Adding the camera/lens/developer info is nice but not necessary. I can go to the shelf and pull out a binder of negatives back to 2000, when I started doing b&w seriously and developing my own film. I cringe a bit at some of those sheets, but I am glad that I have them, as they document my growth as a photographer.  Yes, I still have negatives that go back to 1973, and the subjects I chose are not so different from what I shoot now, but 40+ years later, I think I better understand the why I shoot what I do.Canon EOS Rebel 2000 - look at the time!"},
{"title": "Sharp and Silent - The Ricoh 500G", "date": "Saturday, November 05, 2016", "text": "There are some camera form factors that are appealing, and despite there being \"better\" options, many of the  1970s 35 mm compact range-finder cameras are really quite good, and especially the models produced by Riken Optical in Japan, better known by the name Ricoh.  I was first turned onto the compact RF cameras by Steven Gandy's Camera Quest pages.  He's done all the home work, so take a look at his information. Over the years I have owned/used a variety of compact RF cameras, ranging from the Rollei 35 to the Canon QL17.  When you go compact, there are compromises that have to be made.  In the case of the Rollei, it's really a guess-focus camera, but the lens quality and build is superb.  The Canon QL17 is a great compact rangefinder, so long as the electronics work.  Otherwise, it's a doorstop.  In between are Olympus models,  such as the Olympus RC and SP, which are very well-made, have excellent optics, and are very classic in their styling.  There are also the very compact Konica C35, the highly-regarded Konica Auto S3, and the Ricoh 500G and 500GX cameras.  The Chinon 35EE is very similar to the Ricoh 500G, and whether it's because of shared manufacturing, copying, or other reasons, there has always seemed to be similar models of Ricoh and Chinon cameras, as well as Cosina, with their Compact 35E.  I'll leave those for the reader to look up, as chasing the information online is a lot of fun. I have owned a Konica C35, and I feel it's one of those under-rated cameras that produce better images than they should.  Most of the models listed here have 38-42 mm lenses with a maximum aperture of f/2.8. B, and a maximum shutter speed of 1/500 sec.  No built-in flash, but the do have a hot shoe, and flash sync at most speeds.  A few even have a pc socket for flash.  My perfect \"camera\" has either shutter or aperture priority with manual over-ride, a decent rangefinder, self-timer, cable-release socket, tripod socket, and B mode.  The camera that fits that specification is the Ricoh 500G. The Ricoh 500G dates from 1971-75, and features the typical CdS exposure metering in the rim around the lens, which enables the use of filters and accurate metering.  The camera focuses from just under a meter to infinity, so yes, it can do portraits. It has a 40mm f/2.8 Rikenon lens, shutter speeds from B, and 1/8 to 1/500 sec.  It can be shutter priority exposure or completely manual (and an M shows in the viewfinder). Aperture ranges from f/2.8 to f/16, and can be manually set or chosen by the camera under \"A\" mode.    The front filter ring takes 46 mm filters. It operates VERY quietly, as one would expect from a non-motorized manual RF from the 1970s.  I happened to have a case of GAS a few years ago (no, it's not the only time!) and after seeing an all-black 500G, I found one on eBay that was at a decent price (The chrome model is more common).  I had to redo all of the foam on the film door, but it was worth the effort, as the camera operates beautifully and I am happy with the images.   You can find these cameras on eBay for between $25-$75.What is so great about these cameras is that they are well-made, metal-bodied, and have no quirks in operation.  I don't use my 500G a lot, but it has a place in my camera bag, and easily fits into a jacket pocket. Here are a few images from the camera.

{"title": "The Kiev 19 - A \"Red Star\" Nikon ", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2016", "text": "A great many cameras have come from the Kiev Arsenal factory in Ukraine, and pre-Soviet breakup models started with the Contax II and III-clone Kiev series of rangefinder cameras.  There are a whole series of those, which ended with the Kiev 4m (1977-1987).   I briefly owned a Kiev 4, and had the shaft of the winding knob break.  Not a good sign of quality, but who knows how it was abused before I owned it.  Later, I owned a Kiev 60, which was a clone of the Pentacon Six, but a bit less elegant-looking.  I also once owned a Kiev 35A, which was a clone of the Minox 35GT. It actually worked pretty well until it didn't.  Probably no worse than the Minox models, which also seem to have a high failure rate.  My daughter once owned a Kiev-88, which was a clone of the Hasselblad 1000F.  It actually is a pretty nice medium-format SLR, and though it had its quirks, it was a reliable camera.    That brings me to the Kiev 35mm SLRs, of which there are a few,  Not as many models as the Russian Zenits, but certainly enough to make collecting them a challenge.  With all of the different lens mounts available, it seems that the M42 universal screw mount and the Pentax K-mount ended up being the ones used most.  However, the Kiev 19 has the distinction of being the only non-Nikon camera I know of that used Nikon F-mount lenses (Yes, I have long known about the Ricoh/Nikkorex models, but they don't count here).  My first experience with the Kiev 19 was the brand-new in-box 19M that I purchased around 2001 or so.  I think I paid about $90 for it. Comparing it to my Nikon FE at the time was like comparing an Argus C3 to a Contax III.  Both do the same things, but one does it more quietly with more shutter speed choices.  The 19M did feature TTL  aperture-coupled metering, and a range of shutter speeds from B-1/2 -1/500 sec. The body, as I recall, felt a bit plastic-like.   It used most Nikon F-mount lenses that I tried it with. with expired Fuji Reala film, 2014Two years ago I purchased a Kiev 19, the older model, from a seller in Russia.   It arrived with a Helios 50mm f/2 lens.  The Helios lenses are in general, very good.  My lens self-destructed last year, and I could not put it back together.  However, because the Kiev 19 uses stop-down metering, I can use non-AI lenses as well as AI- lenses, so I certainly did not lack for a lens.  In the photo above it has the very desirable and very good Vivitar 28mm 2.5 wide-angle lens attached.   The Kiev 19 has a vertically-travelling metal focal-plane shutter, B, 1/2 - 1/500 shutter speeds, a hot shoe, and a PC flash connector.  It has a metal body, and in general, I believe is better made than the 19M.  It's no Nikon FM, but it isn't a Cosina-made FM10, either.With current prices for real Nikon F-mount  film cameras being quite low, it may be hard to justify purchasing a Kiev 19 or 19M, especially considering the feature set.  The stop-down metering may be a bit archaic for some, but it does work pretty well. One thing to watch for though, is to avoid light coming in through the eyepiece, which will throw off the metering. It's very sensitive to sidelight coming in.I haven't used mine in a while, so it may be time to take it on my next road trip, in the hunt for red October, or maybe gray November."},

Nah!  Anyhow, I recently developed some accumulating rolls of b&w white, and this one roll of Kentmere 100 from my Olympus Trip 35 had July - September images all over it.  The first half of the roll was from the mid-July Ann Arbor Art Fair, then a few shots from our trip to the Upper Peninsula, and finished off with a few images from my visit to the FPP headquarters in New Jersey.  The Trip 35 is rarely my main camera, but when it is, I can easily run through a roll of film.  As a secondary camera, it really shines, and I rarely find a shot from it that doesn't come out as expected.  In those rare instances, it's probably because I have exceeded the capability of the camera. Ann Arbor Art Fair.  If there is ever a time to use a camera like the Trip 35, that is it. We get about half a million people in the city over the course of 4 days, and you can't escape the Art Fair.  This year is the first time I have gone to work without seeing any of it, as my workplace is now 5 miles from campus.  So, I went on a Saturday morning hoping to shoot some really slow film (discussed here), but also brought the Trip 35 for street shooting.Then in August, a few shots from the beach at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The storms a few days prior had sent waves far up on the beach, and the wave forms were still there in the sand, which I found to be really cool abstracts.While the Trip 35 can't do everything, what it does do under good conditions really points out how good a little camera it is. No batteries.

As if anything can be normal when using a camera with such slow film in it!  Those who have been following my blog know that I have been shooting slow films for quite a few years.  I bought a few rolls of Mr. Brown from the FPP store, and finally loaded up my Nikon N90s, set the ISO to 6, and went off to Fleming Creek yesterday.  I hoped to do some nice long exposures of the water while it was overcast. Using a 50 mm 1.8 AF-D Nikkor, and an 80-200 mm AF-D Nikkor on the N90s, I shot a roll of  Mr. Brown along Fleming Creek near Parker Mill. Exposures were at f/16 and f/11 in Aperture Priority mode, with the longest time at around 16 seconds, and many were in the 8-11 sec range.  The mushrooms were shot at f/8.After I got home, I developed Mr. Brown in XTOL at 1:1 for 9 minutes at 20°C.  I just finished scanning in the negatives on my Epson V700 photo scanner.  To say I am impressed with the results would be an understatement!  The film is on a very strong and thin mylar base, and lies beautifully flat in the scanner. No curling, cupping, or other problems.  It scans beautifully.  Based upon my results, I may be tempted to try a roll at ISO 12 under similar situations.Long exposures of water without using a ND filter is a plus, and this film warrants more experimentation."},

I have had many other \"Soviet-made\" cameras from Lubitels to Zenits, to Kievs to Smenas.  Lomo LC-As just didn't come my way, but that changed a few weeks ago, when Mike Raso handed me one.  \"It might work, it might not.\"    I took it home, and put in 3 LR-44 cells, and realized that I had to adjust the battery terminal so that it pushed against the cells.  Voila! It worked.  I merely had to put some tape over the battery door to keep it shut.  I put in a short roll of Eastman 5222, adjusted the Gost dial to approximate ISO 200, and shot with it.    I developed the film last night, and here are a few of the shots from that test roll.  Overall, not bad for an automatic camera.  I took a few photos at night in the light of a Kroger parking lot, and am pleased how those came out, and overall, the camera performed quite well.

{"title": "Testing the Phochron XA Shutter Tester!", "date": "Thursday, September 29, 2016", "text": "Back in July, I met Eric Bergstrom at a photo meetup in Kalamazoo.  He's an interesting guy that lives on the W side of Michigan, and not only is he a film photography enthusiast, he's also a tinkerer, and an electrical engineer.  That means he knows a heck of a lot more about making electronic doodads than I do, and more than that, he's an entrepreneur.  He brought along a version of a compact device that tests shutter speeds, which he showed us in operation.  I was immediately hooked.   I liked the way the device did the thinking and just gave me a nice meaningful readout, and it was EASY to use.  Eric promised to send me a pre-production version to test out for the Film Photography Podcast, and yes, we did do a test, but it's audio only, so you can't really see it in action.  However, we were all impressed with the ease of use, compact size, and nice display with a menu system that's easy to navigate.The  Phochron XA shutter tester is easy to use, and has a built-in illustrated manual available on the LCD display!It's easy to just use the included LED and single sensor for any shutter type.  If you want to have more critical testing of a vertical or horizontal focal plane shutter, an additional plug-in sensor unit will be available. I didn't try it, as I just wanted the quick and easy shutter speed measurements from various cameras.Why would you possibly want one?  That's easy for me to answer. If I sell a camera on ebay, I would like to be able to state how accurate the shutter is.  Second, what about those box cameras?  What's the shutter speed.  Third, I am always surprised at how much off a shutter may be on old cameras.  If you are wondering why negatives may not be quite what you expected with a certain camera, it could very well be that the shutter you thought was firing at 1/500 sec is actually 1/125.  That's two stops off.   Of course, it's a useful testing item.If I have any suggestions, it would be that some sort of cradle with a tripod socket could be an add-on.  It's useful to be able to have the Phochron XA solidly mounted for camera testing.  I found the shutter tester easy to use, and a lot of fun, since I could fire a shutter repeatedly, and the display would show me all of the tests for a certain setting, as well as a summary with the average time.Eric plans to put together a Kickstarter to fund production of the shutter tester, which is called the Phochron XA.  You can see more about it at his website, phochronxa.comTesting the shutter."},

It was morning, Adrienne was still asleep, and I was feeling a bit  creative.  I got out my Nikon F3HP with a 50mm lens, tripod,  and did some shots of the interior.  I finished scanning in the Kentmere 100 negatives, and as I edited them, it occurred to me that there were elements I had seen before, made by other, earlier photographers that for whatever motivations, did the same thing at some point.  So, here are some images that I made, and you can decide who would have shot what, had they been there."},

My most used film was Kentmere 100, but as you can see, I had quite a bit of variety.I also shot quite a bit of digital with my trusty Nikon D200 and a bag of lenses. The camera phone  of course, was a good way to document our travel, if only to put a few things up on Instagram. One of the things in the Upper Peninsula is that cell phone service isn't always good.   Keeping a charger cable in the car is a good idea to keep your phone from running down if it is searching for a signal much of the day.One of my favorite places to shoot under various types of weather is Black Rocks on Presque Isle.  This time, it was an overcast day with some light rain, which really made for some good photography this time around.Black Rockslots of sky along Lake Superior!a much calmer lake a few days after the stormGreat Lakes beaches are hard to beat.I did a little macro, too.  A male Polistes dominulus.

{"title": "Kentmere 100 Film..a bargain, and it's very good.", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2016", "text": "Over the years, I have shot just about every emulsion of B&W film that is available. Some become \"go-to\" favorites, and others get used sparingly for specific purposes. Sometimes I come across a cache of a long-discontinued film, such as Kodak Panatomic-X, and use it sparingly, not wanting to use it up right away.   It's downright annoying to really like a certain film and then have it unavailable.  One of my favorite medium-speed monochrome 35mm films is Kentmere 100.  It has fine grain, lies really flat in the scanner, and is readily available in bulk rolls.  Sold by Harman, it is made by Ilford, and is similar in performance to the Ilford FP-4 film.  My favorite developer with it is D76 1:1, but XTOL 1:1 gives a nice result as well.  I could write all sorts of things about the film, but it is probably just easier to show you some photographs:old bus, Ann Arbor, MIRobert BeechDepot Street, Ypsilanti, MIHillsdale, MIUgly Mug, Ypsilanti, MIShort's Brewery Window, Bellaire, MIBirchwood Inn, Harbor Springs, MIHocking Hills, OHI buy Kentmere 100 in bulk rolls, which saves me money.  A roll of 100 ft. is about $40, which prices it far below a lot of films.  The quality is excellent, and if you want to try a roll or two, of course, it is sold in 36 exp. rolls for about $3/roll online.  It is available from all of the typical places such as B&H, Adorama, and Freestyle.  I highly recommend Kentmere 100."},
{"title": "Buying an AF 35mm Film SLR.  ", "date": "Friday, August 05, 2016", "text": "What is the best SLR system camera? This is a question that we used to see a lot, back  before digital began its takeover.  If you are just getting into film, my first response would be - \"What DSLR are you using?\"  If you are using a Canon EOS DSLR, then you should look at the pre-digital EOS models.  If you are using a Nikon, then by all means, look at Nikon AF models.  If you are using Pentax,  Pentax AF models, and Sony Alpha DSLR -- Minolta AF cameras (Maxxum series).   Essentially, those are the only DSLR systems with compatible lenses for the film bodies. There is one caveat, though.  If you are using a lens designed specifically for the APS-C form factor, such as a Canon EF-S lens, or a Nikon DX lens, you will get a vignetted image when used with a full-frame SLR.    Why would you want to use a later AF-system when there are so many robust metal-bodied cameras out there?  Here are a few reasons to look at more recent cameras.Control Layout  For one, let's say you are using a Nikon D7000 DSLR and are thinking about buying a film body.  If you look at the controls and ergonomics of most of the better Nikon DSLRs, they are pretty similar to the Nikon F100.  LCD displays, control dials and buttons are similar.   They can use the same AF-D and FX lenses (non-DX, of course).  In fact, the F100 is perhaps the best advanced film SLR from Nikon in terms of cost and features.   Today, you can pick one up for a fraction of what they used to go for.   If your cameras have similar control layouts, you learn how to use them more quickly. LensesAgain, if you can share the lenses between your DSLR and your film SLR, you are also saving money and avoiding duplication.  You can bring a film body along loaded with B&W, and use the DSLR for color.  Swap out lenses as needed.Newer TechnologyWhile much can be said in favor of the older cameras, newer cameras offer more features, better metering, and often, ease of use.  Being able to bracket your exposures automatically is a great feature that won't be found in older manual cameras.  Having spot metering as well as other modes is very useful. If you are used to auto-focus, the AF film bodies will be appreciated.Fewer MilesAs much as I like older cameras, and still continue to use them, you have to remember that a model that appeared in 1970 is now almost 50 years old.  It may have been through many owners, or used a lot, or used a few times and then sat on a shelf for the last 30 years.  Meanwhile, a late-model AF SLR may only be 15 years old or less.PriceHere's the great advantage. Yes, the later 35mm film camera SLRs often have a lot of plastic.  But they may have titanium frames, be weather-sealed, etc.  You will also find them to be incredibly cheap on the used market, whether it's ebay, a resale shop, or a garage sale.  They are not old enough to be called classics, and they are plentiful. Built-In FlashWhile we take a built-in flash for granted on modern cameras, it was only the AF bodies that started featuring them.  They may not be the best flash option for all instances, but they are handy to have for fill flash.  Not all AF bodies have a built-in flash, though. Nikon's pro-level cameras do not have them. Camera RecommendationsCanon - The EOS mount is very popular, and Canon was the first to really exploit the low-end AF SLR market with their Canon Rebel series.  They are low-cost bodies, and most of them should still work well.  They are also cheap, with  bodies often selling for $10 US.   The 35-80mm EF lens was a mainstay with them.  You can use therm in manual as well as the other auto-modes.  However, there are many different EOS 35mm film bodies that are more \"professional\" that have a better build and more features.  The Canon EOS Elan II is a wonderful body. Minolta - Sony bought Konica/Minolta and kept the Alpha mount from the Minolta Maxxum series of cameras.  There are many, many orphaned Maxxum bodies out there that sell for the price of a Starbucks Mocha.  Minolta was the undisputed king of features on AF bodies.  The low-end models such as the QTsi, are quite plasticky.  Higher-end models such as the Maxxum 9 or 7 are very full-featured.  I have only personally used the Maxxum 7000, which was the very first real AF SLR.   That model of course, is quite old and slow.  The Minolta Maxxum 9xi has a top shutter speed of 1/12,000 sec.  This may be helpful in deciding on a purchase.Nikon - This is a group that I know well.  Nikon's early AF SLRs are fully compatible with manual Nikkors, and the N2020 and N8008 are typical examples.  The 8008 has an excellent viewfinder.  Later, Nikon's amateur-level AF SLRS deleted some features, such as the ability to meter with manual lenses. That is the case with the N55, N60, N65, N75, and N80  models.  If you are only using AF lenses, this isn't a problem.  Of course, there is the behemoth F4 and the expensive F5, and F6 models.  I would stay away from the N70, as Nikon departed from sanity on that design. The N90 is an amazingly timeless camera that works very well with most lenses.  However, the F100 remains my favorite. It uses manual and all AF lenses, including  G-lenses (lack an aperture ring like the Canon EF lenses).  You can often pick up an N65 body for about $10-$15.Pentax - The K-mount system just amazes me as it just keeps chugging along.  While the lens selection may not compare as favorably as Nikon and Canon, you can use the manual lenses on many bodies just fine.  As far as AF camera bodies go, I have reviewed a few, and yes, the cameras are plasticky, but they seem to work well, and are bargains.  Some of the low-end models MZ-30, 50, 60 will only fire with AF lenses attached.  I recommend the ZX-5 if you want to have a low-cost camera that will use manual and AF lenses.  Perhaps the best of the bunch might be the MZ-S, with its Magnesium-alloy body.So, there you go with some options.  Get a body, some film, and fire way!"},
{"title": "SLOOOOW Film Adventure", "date": "Sunday, July 31, 2016", "text": "Another really slow film.One of the more interesting aspects of using film is that we have the opportunity to experiment with emulsions that are not the every-day sort of film.  In the digital world, the ISOs keep getting insanely higher each year.  But, they never go LOWER.  Typically, ISO 100 is the lowest ISO available.  With film, there are emulsions with an ISO of 0.75.  Of course, most people would never dream of shooting with a low ISO film, and the standard low ISO in the film world is 25.  TechPan, that do-it-all film has an ISO of 25 in most applications.  Kodalith, designed to be a high-contrast graphic arts film has an ISO of 12.  Most of the available (mostly old-stock) low ISO films are designed for specific applications, not as general-purpose photographic films.  I still shoot a dwindling stock of Kodak Panatomic-X whose box speed is ISO 32, but I shoot it at 25 with great results.  Ilford's Pan-F has a box speed of ISO 50, but I shoot it at 32.   The now out-of-production Polypan-F has a stated speed of 50, but can be pushed higher. an oldie low-ISO  in color, no less. To go back to my original thought -- why would you want to shoot a low ISO film?  For one, you can shoot wide-open on a sunny day for great shallow DOF results.   Stopping down, you can achieve a motion blur in the same situation.  So, let's get REALLY slow.  ISO 3.  I had a project in mind, and that was to do a shoot at the annual Ann Arbor Art Fair, which happens every mid- July. Over the 4 days, there are up to a half million visitors.  What I wanted to do, was to try and get a ghost-like blur of people at the art fair. Of course, it's mid-summer, almost always bright and sunny. How do I do that?1. Use a low ISO film.  I tried two. The FPP store had a Svema Micrat-Ortho which is a POSITIVE ISO 1 film (or maybe 0.75), as well as a Svema MZ-3, which is a higher-contrast repro film of ISO 3.  2. Use a Neutral Density Filter to allow even less light -- I used a 3-stop ND filter.3. Use a camera that allows me to get as close to a low ISO setting as possible. My F100 ISO dial goes to ISO 6, and I can compensate +1, +2,  (and more)  full stops to achieve an ISO of 3 or less. 4. Shoot at f/22 if possible.  I used a Nikkor 24-120 AF zoom.5. Of course, this means a tripod is absolutely necessary.  Remote release is also handy, as well.   ResultsRoll 1 -- The Svema Micrat Ortho was developed in D76 1:1 for 7 minutes.  Exposures ranged from 10-25 seconds.Roll 2-- Svema MZ-3. Developed in Kodak Technidol LC for 15 minutes.  Exposures ranged from 3-10 seconds.Both of these films are unusual films that are not being used as the films were intended.  If I were to shoot this way again, I would probably just use some of my Kodak Tech Pan with a 3 stop ND filter + a polarizer or red filter, and a cloudy day would surely help.  Maybe this fall, I will do it some more down town.  If you want to see some fantastic work in this vein, look up Alexey Titarenko's photographs from Russia.  Really good work."},
{"title": "The Chinon CS-4", "date": "Sunday, July 17, 2016", "text": "The Chinon CS-4 - Reliable Screw-Mount SLRChinon was a long-time manufacturer of cameras and lenses -- most often as a supplier for other brands. Chinon, Cosina, and Ricoh seem to be thought of as second-tier cameras as compared to the Canon, Nikon, Pentax, and Olympus brands that dominated the 35mm SLR scene throughout the 1970s and 80s. Chinon, based in Japan, was a company from 1948-2004, and at some point late in their run was bought by Kodak.  However, during the 70s and 80s, they produced very competent SLRs that were often under the Sears brand, Revue brand, as well as their own.  As autofocus and electronic cameras began gaining popularity, Chinon produced some memorable, if not odd designs, such as the Chinon Genesis line of cameras.  Check out Butkus' many Chinon manuals.The Chinon CS-4 is a basic, no-frills SLR that has an M-42 mount (Pentax or Praktica screw mount), which was popular in the late 1960s-1970s among second-tier manufacturers, since it was considered a \"universal\" mount. When Pentax finally switched to the bayonet K-mount, it became the defacto \"universal\" mount among the same manufacturers.  The CS-4, while it has the older screw-mount, uses a modern LR-44 cell for the meter (two cells required).  LEDs (red and green) in the stop-down metering let you know when your exposure is correct.  Shutter speeds range from B, 1-1/1000 sec, and the ISO settings range from 25-1600.  There is no self-timer. A hot-shoe allows any hot-shoe flash to be used, and 1/60 sec is the flash sync speed.  A pretty basic camera with a reliable Seiko metal focal-plane shutter.  The back has a film reminder slot, and the viewfinder visibility is 92%. The Chinon CS-4 will accept just about any M-42 mount lens, so the user certainly has a large number of lenses to work with, and there are some desirable classic lenses that can be used to good effect with this camera.  The Chinon CS-4 that I purchased back in December 2015 came in a bag with the 55mm f/1.7 Chinon lens and a Lentar 28mm  f/2.8 lens, a JC Penney flash, filters, and manual -- for $10.  The camera works well, and like any fully manual SLR, it will give as good as a result as the skills of the person that is using it.  For a beginner into film photography, this camera would be highly desirable. The red/green LEDs for determining the exposure lie alongside the viewfinder and are easily seen. While I paid $10 for the bag of stuff at a thrift shop, a CS-4 with lens in good working condition should be available for under $40 on ebay. All of the images below were shot with this camera."},
{"title": "The Fuji GW690 ", "date": "Saturday, July 16, 2016", "text": "Guest post from The Darkroomist!The Fuji GW690 is a one trick pony, but it’s one helluva good trick. For starters the GW690 is a 6x9 camera with a wide-ish 90mm lens. It’s probably close to a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera. It’s wide and you can tell, but it’s not so wide that the perspective becomes a dominant part of the image. It’s  a subtle wide-ness. Being a fixed lens camera you’re stuck with the 90mm, however if you want a “super wide” angle alternative the Fuji GSW690 with a 65mm lens is a great option.The GW690 is a rangefinder which has it’s pluses and minuses. The biggest minus is that you do not look through the taking lens. This can lead to a range of problems including leaving the lens cap on (just throw it away) or contrast filters, soft focus filters, you name it. Plus if you like things like gradient filters, vignettes, or montagers, this won’t be your best bet. While the camera does its best to compensate for parallax error, it’s still a good idea to pad the frame a little.The biggest plus is sharpness. The GW690 being a rangefinder doesn’t need to utilize a lens that retro-focuses like SLR cameras do. This translates to increases in sharpness. In fact I’d say this is hands down the sharpest setup I own. It’s truly impressive. The Fuji 90mm/3.5 is ridiculously sharp and in the 6x9 format, it’s just stunning. More on that in a bit.  Lets dive into the camera for a minute next.As stated previously the camera is a rangefinder. To focus it there is a spot in the center of the viewfinder that contains a composite image and is yellow tinged. To focus, you line up the two images and when they are perfectly atop one another you’re focused.  It takes a little to get used to but it has the benefit of having a bright viewfinder that’s capable even in low light conditions. Another famous rangefinder camera is the Lieca. The Fuji GW690 has been affectionately nicknamed the “Texas Leica.”For what it is, basically a just-short-of-large-format camera, the GW690 is easy to use and light. It’s also not as big an encumbrance as you might think. It’s not small for sure, but if you’re hiking, or urbexing, or doing anything that might require a conservative kit, this would be a candidate for a small kit with a  big punch.Personally I feel the camera’s best use is for scenic images. Being a wide angle makes it limited for traditional portraiture. If you want to put a person in a scenic image, great! It’d do that well, but you’d never reach for this camera to do a head-and-shoulders shot. It’s just not the right tool for that job.With the 90mm prime (non-zooming) lens you’re going to use the old shoe leather zoom.  This camera works best with subjects you can walk around and get close to. Buildings, waterfalls, mountains, interiors, trains, etc. Fairly big, fairly stationary stuff. This would not be a great camera for sports (well it might work for something like the Tour de France but not baseball), wildlife, or macro photography.  I’m on the fence as to whether or not this would make a good street camera. It’s not exactly discrete and 8 shots per 120 would be a bit limiting, but the wide angle and quiet shutter would make the “F8 and be there” a cinch.This is a fully mechanical camera. There is no built in light meter and no batteries needed. There’s an accessory cold shoe on top of the camera. Flash sync is via a PC socket on the side of the lens. Being a leaf shutter the camera syncs at all shutter speeds.One of my favorite things to do with this camera is pile on the sharpness.  If you have a good thing, you might as well run with it, right? I love putting Fuji Neopan Acros in this camera. It’s a tight, T grain film that has good latitude and the least reciprocity failure you’ll find anywhere. Soup that up with Xtol and your jaw will drop. We’re talking 16x20s with details for days.That right there is a magic formula. Fuji GW690, Acros, developed in Xtol and printed 16x20. It is impressive. Just keep in mind that 6x9 is more rectangular and 16x20 (8x10) is squarer. Honestly when I print 8x10’s with this combination I have a hard time grain focusing because I can’s see the grain!One quibble I have with Fuji’s cameras are the straps. The OEM strap is pretty wimpy. Granted it’s reasonably light but you might not want to walk around all day with this around your neck with the stock neck strap. It’s thin and not padded or stretchy at all. It’s you’re basic nylon woven strap in an unexciting, institutional shade of gray.  Now here’s the kicker, I looked into buying a Fuji 617 (6x17) camera that starts at roughly $2k. It has the same strap! C’mon Fuji! If someone is dropping “benjis” on a camera, throw in a spiffy strap.Alas, my GW690 has been on the shelf for a little bit now. While I have shot some of my proudest pieces with it, it’s developed a film spacing issue. It’s almost always overlaps frame 6 & 7, With 6x9 you only get 8 shots so losing 25% of a 120 roll is just hard to swallow. Lately I’ve been caught in the fix or buy again dilemma. It’s almost a draw with GW690 being reasonably affordable with some units selling for less than $300. KEH.com quoted me $250 for a CLA and film spacing fix.I’ll probably buy it again, it’s just that good. There’s also a II and III version. They’re all basically the same camera with incremental improvements.  Also this camera can use 120 or 220 film. As a primarily black and white photographer I tend to use 120 film as Kodak TXP 320 was the last b&w 220 and has been discontinued for a few years now.

{"title": "Photographer Documentaries", "date": "Saturday, July 02, 2016", "text": "I don't know about other people, but I enjoy a good documentary film about something that interests me, and even  better, one about photography -- especially about a photographer.  Due to Amazon Prime and Netflix, we have a huge array of choices about what to watch, and more importantly, we can watch when we have the time.  Being able to watch on my iPad while developing film is a nice option, thanks to streaming video services, as well as YouTube.Thankfully, YouTube has some amazing videos that are available, and this link will take you to a really good start on 20 that you should watch.  With some searching, you will obviously find more, but it's a place to start.A good photography documentary inspires me and educates me.   For those that don't like to read books (that does not apply to me), a video is a good way to learn about the work of some of the more famous (and infamous) photographers.  In this age of short attention span, the YouTube videos are definitely a plus.  I tell young photographers that one way to improve their work is to study the work of others -- go to galleries and museums; read books, study monographs of other's work.  Videos also fit in there, too. Not everyone is able to visit a museum or access good books in a library.  Here again, is where a streaming video can be of great educational benefit.   Petapixel has a HUGE list of photography videos that you should check out. Last night I was looking through Amazon Prime's listing, and I found Ted Forbes' videos from his Artist's Series on the Art of Photography.  Seeing them on my TV was even better than on my iPad, and they are short, well-produced and fascinating.Here are a few of my more recent favorites:Finding Vivian Maier. - Yes, her photographs are fantastic--but her story is a strange one, and we'll never know all the details of her life.  This enigmatic woman captivates us with her photographs, but how I wish she had the will to show her work while she was alive.  While a lot has happened since this video was produced, it's very entertaining and well-done.  I first saw it in the theater in Royal Oak,MI,  and it was an emotional experience. What Remains - This is a very personal documentary that puts the viewer in the room with Sally Mann and her family.  Her recent autobiography is fantastic to read, but this documentary certainly captures her persona, her work, and her philosophy.  I have no desire to go to a body farm, but Mann is the embodiment of the committed artist.   A film that is sure to stir the creative process, if not inspire someone. Bill Cunningham New York - With the recent passing of this iconic street/fashion photographer, I am sure this will get a lot of views.  It is an entirely charming documentary about Bill Cunningham, photographer of fashion in NY and Paris -- as if fashion photography was done by a photojournalist.  Cunningham was ethical and hard-working, minimalist, and humane.  This video intrudes into his life and I am so glad that it was made. He was unique. You may not care about fashion, but it's all around us, and this movie is more than about fashion - it's about a life.Manufactured Landscapes - A film about the photographer Edward Burtynsky, who searches various places in the world for the effects of industrial processes on the earth and on humanity.  Visually stunning, at times depressing, but always engaging.  I think this movie should be shown in business schools as well as environmental education.  The movie will make you think about that next trip to the superstore.Strand - Under The Darkcloth - I thought I knew a fair amount about Paul Strand (1890-1976), but it was mostly about his early work.  After he moved to France in 1949 - we see less of him represented, but he was a prolific film-maker and photographer.  This documentary is engaging and gives us a better understanding of the man and his photography.  The movie was produced in 1989, and I highly recommend it. I wish I had access to documentaries like these while growing up. I think they would have been influential in my choice of a career. Not that I regret being an entomologist at all, but it never occurred to me that photography was a profession when I was a kid.  All the more reason to be a mentor. You never know what the outcome will be, but you may make a huge difference to someone."},
{"title": "It's been a month!", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2016", "text": "Yes, it has been a month since my last post. June has been busy, as I have been away over 3  weekends. From the 10-12 of June Adrienne and I were in Bellaire, MI for the Michigan Entomological Society Meeting.  From the 16-19, I was at Photostock in Harbor Springs. And I returned Tuesday from the 23-28 trip to Amenia, NY for Adrienne's mom's 90th birthday.  Lots of miles on my Ford Escape, lots of film to process (starting today),  and lots of digital files to edit. One of the things I have greatly appreciated is being able to use my smartphone (Android) to update during a trip. The images and comments become sort of like placeholders to remind me where I was on these trips. They also inform family and friends where the heck I am at.  I do try and keep a written diary of the photo aspects of a trip, but Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are useful for documenting my travels.  Of course, the snaps I take for Instagram are not of the quality that my real cameras take, but they have their own low-fi charm. Preparing my equipment for any particular trip is always an interesting dilemma. What cameras do I bring? How many bags? What film? Which digital system?  You are probably saying \"This guy has too many cameras.\"  Truth is, I probably do, but i have pared down quite a bit.  My digital gear is in 3 categories:Fuji X100S -- ideal for street shooting, gatherings, and travel.  Limited to only the 35mm-equivalent f/2 lens.   Image quality is fantastic. Nikon D200 or D3200 - full range of lenses, etc.  The 3200 is lighter, more compact, and has a better high ISO ability, but the D200 is more versatile, better overall camera, but fewer MPs.Nikon 1J1 - Don't laugh -- this little camera is very capable, and my favorite lenses on it are the wide-angle (28mm equiv.) and my 25mm CCTV lens with the swirly bokeh.  It's a compact, non-threatening, and very creative tool.Film cameras are a whole different environment.  35mm or medium format? Polaroid or Instax? Toy cameras? Rangefinders? Which SLR system?  and so it goes. June has found me on a Nikon SLR kick, and mostly I have been using the Nikon FG, F3HP, and FM2N.  The FG now sits in my all-purpose bag with the Yashica A TLR, Holga, and Vivitar ultra-wide P&S.  With a 50mm 1.8 and the 36-72mm zoom, for the FG,  it is a nice package.  I love the viewfinder in the F3HP.  As a glasses-wearer, it is perfect for me.  I also know that the F3 is pretty much the perfect camera, unless one is using flash a lot.  The Nikon FM2N is another great camera, and I should use it more than I do.  All manual, and I like the metering.  Solid. I knew that I would not be doing much photography at the MES meeting, so I took only the Fuji X100S, Nikon D200 bag, and Nikon FG.   For Photostock, I tried to limit my choices, and ended up taking the Mamiya C330 bag, Fuji X100S, Nikon F3HP bag, and the all-purpose bag, with a sack of Dianas and Holgas for good measure.For the New York State Trip -- Nikon 1J1 bag, D3200 bag with external flash for the birthday celebration, all-purpose bag, and Nikon FM2N bag. Oh, and also the Leica M2.  The only thing I had forgotten was a Gorillapod for some low-angle shots. My carbon-fiber tripod with a ball head is ALWAYS in the back of the car, and it gets used a lot.  I brought a 19mm lens to use with the FM2N along with a deep yellow filter to shoot a roll of FPP color Infrachrome film.  I hope to have it developed soon.I know one can go really minimalist for a trip, and I have done so in the past.  However, if I have the room, I may as well bring what I think I'll need.  A long trip has many photo opportunities, and I hate it when I am limited by the tools I can use for a shot.  Also, as you can see, I am not averse to shooting digital, and am not limited to only film.  It all depends on the situation and my desired result.  All these things are tools to be used to get whatever I am after.  It has been a busy and productive month, and  I hope to process all of my film over the next week or so.  In the meantime, here are a few shots from the digital cameras.fence, Amenia, NY, June 27Dingmans Falls, PA, June 23Alley, Clare, MI June 10.farm at Birchwood Inn, June 16A.D.

{"title": "Developing B&W Film. Just Do It.", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2016", "text": "It's been sort of interesting seeing some people in social media look for easy ways to develop film. Some people seem to think that there should be a shortcut for immediate results.  Others think that only a darkroom will enable them to develop film, and then there are some that want to develop the film in the canister, etc.  While I understand that there are inquiring minds out there, and there is always a guy saying something about \"inventing a better way,\" I want to tell you this: THE NEGATIVE IS YOUR STARTING POINT.  DON'T FUCK IT UP!Hanging to dry.While my comment above may seem a bit harsh, let me explain.  You will learn nothing about development if your first inclination is to short-cut a process that you know little about.  I get it, we all like things to be easy. But things get easier the more you do them and become more familiar with the routine.  Think about the first time you drove a car. So many things to watch for!  After a short while, you get comfortable with it.  After a long while, you hardly have to think about what you are doing, but you still have to pay attention.  It's no different with developing film.  You can't get to your destination without putting in the time.  You can't expect it to be any different with photography.  The negative is your base piece of information. Film costs money. Why would you want to potentially ruin an image that you took the time to compose and shoot. Does your photography mean that little to you?  Believe me, many have tried quick methods, \"time-savers\" for developing film, and those methods have been found to be a waste.  If they were not, they would have been widely adopted. But they were not.   Some of the reasons we see people wanting shortcuts are probably as follows:(1) coming entirely from a digital background to film(2) not being mentored by a film user, nor taking any class in traditional photography(3) not reading any books about darkroom practice(4) impatience and/or ignorance because of the aboveSo, you have some b&w film.  It's easy to develop if you keep things simple.  To start, use only one developer. Use only one type of film.  Then, when you think you have a handle on things, you can begin to explore other developer/film combinations.  Some people get so into trying many films and developers that they never really achieve a consistent result to know what actually works well. So, keep it simple and become proficient with one film and developer so that you know what a good negative looks like.  I have lost track of how many rolls I have developed, -- it's certainly in the thousands.  Even then, I do not get complacent. You need:daylight developing tank with adjustable reels (Paterson style tank)dial thermometerplastic jugs for developer and fixer. You can use water as a stop bath.plastic measuring cups or graduated cylinders for mixingsink with running watertimerfilm changing bag or a completely dark space to load the film into the reels to be placed into the developing tank. Some of these items are available at the Film Photography Project Store.About chemicals -- Most b&w photochemistry is relatively benign, and except for used fixer, it is safe to dump down the drain.  Unless you are doing industrial volumes, that is.  I don't think that applies to any of us.  While I may say Kodak D-76, it's actually available more cheaply from Freestyle as Legacy Pro L-76 developer, which is what I have been using as of late.You can download an app for your smartphone that will time your development process from the folks at the Massive Development Chart.  That will also save you time looking up development times online.When I started developing my own film in 2000 after a hiatus of 26 years, I had just the basic equipment and supplies.  I didn't have a darkroom then, and used a changing bag.  I practiced a lot with a junk roll of film to get adept at loading it in the changing bag.  I used plastic reels then, and still do. They just work better for me --  thousands of rolls later, I still use them. My recommendation for a film/developer combo --Ilford HP-5+ and Kodak D76 mixed 1 part water to 1 part stock solution for 11 minutes developing time at 20 degrees C.    This makes the developer a one-shot use, and is quite economical.  That makes total time for development, fixing, washing at about 25 minutes. There are numerous videos on  YouTube to show how to develop film.  Most are useful if you have not done it before. The Ilford pdf on b&w developing is also very useful.  I highly recommend The Basic Darkroom Book by Tom Grimm, but there are many other books available.Once you have your negatives dry, you can scan them and do whatever post-processing you wish. Or, you can print them in a darkroom, which is a whole chapter by itself.  Store your negatives in strips in the PrintFile Archival preservers. I use the sheets that hold 7 strips of 35mm, 5 across.  You may like the ones that hold 6 strips of 6 across.  I use the 120 sheets too.  Store them in 3 ring binders.  label them so that you know what, when, where, why, and how.  Keep a notebook and record your developing. Does this sound like a lot of work?  It really is not.  But if you are unable to develop at home, you can send it out to The Darkroom and they will do it.   However, you are missing out at one of the things that makes film photography special. Take the time to do it yourself, and you will see and appreciate the magic. Bill Bresler, shot on HP-5+."},
{"title": "DIY E-6 Developing", "date": "Sunday, May 15, 2016", "text": "Lately, I have been developing my own color transparency film (E-6) as well as C-41 color negative film.  Doing color transparency (positive) film is pretty straightforward with the easy to obtain Unicolor E-6 kit, which can be purchased from the Film Photography Project Store as well as Freestyle and other vendors.  I have the 16 oz kit, which does a minimum of 6 rolls of 35mm film.  The process is simple -- mix up the chemicals as directed, and you end up with three bottles -- First Developer, Color Developer, and Blix.  There is a pre-wash and a rinse cycle between each step, followed by a last wash.  Temperatures can be a bit lower than the C-41 kit, with adjustments made in the length of development times.  However, the First Developer step is the critical one for the timing, and you will need to increase the length of time for each additional roll you develop, as the chemicals are re-used.  The kits instructs you on this point, but it's easy to forget if you set things aside for a while and forget about the previous rolls.  Put a piece of tape on the First developer bottle (and yes, you DID label them, right?), and put a tick mark for each roll you develop. The Color developer and the Blix apparently do not need the same compensation.Tips:Use a hot water bath and monitor your temps.  Try and keep them within a degree or two of your target.  Immerse the developing tank in the bath to keep the temperature stable.  I just use the hot water from the tap and keep adding hot water until the temp is about where I want it.Keep another container of water that is near the developer temp for the rinse cycle and you will need enough for 7 tank-fulls of water for each rinse step.  Do keep the caps on the bottles during the process and keep them in the order you'll be using them. Only open the cap to pour back the contents from the developing tank.  You don't want to accidentally knock over a bottle and lose the contents!I use amber glass bottle made for chemicals. Avoid using bottles made for food or drink.  Once you get your first roll done and see the color positives on the roll, you will be hooked.  At $31 for a quart kit, you'll get over a dozen rolls of 35mm film processed.  At the going rates for mail-order labs, you'll save yourself over $100.What about mounting the transparencies?  The only reason to mount them is if you are projecting them.  I have thousands of mounted slides in my files, and I only occasionally have projected them.  It does make it easy to handle individual frames, and the slides are easy to file and label.  However, most of my recent E-6 film is stored in the typical plastic 35mm pages that we put negative strips into.  After I scan them, it's still easy to hold the page over the light box and examine the sheet.My last roll was definitely color shifted to the blue side, and I think it is because it was roll #6, and I had not compensated for the used developer in the First Developer step.  It should have gotten at least another minute.Examples:last roll, Retrochrome 160 - note the blue shift, which is actually pretty cool."},

Arriving at the store at 1035 Ashby Avenue, I was a bit sweaty from the long walk in the warm, sunny afternoon. I was immediately impressed at how many people were working there, and the store's size was much larger than I anticipated.  A real, full-service store with photo paper, chemicals, FILM, darkroom accessories, and all of the other digital and types of equipment one might need. It looked like they have a darkroom, too.    A couple of women that work there were immediately making comments about my old LGP t-shirt, as it has not been available for some time.  I didn't mind being a photo geek at all.  I bought some film, a Looking Glass Photo coffee mug, and a tripod mount for a cellphone.   It was fun stepping into a store that had everything that a photographer may need, and especially catered to the analog community.  If you need a Holga, they had plenty of them in stock, too.  There are also used film cameras and lenses for sale, along with all of the cool digi gadgets you might like to see.Kodak Ektar and Portra films"},

The Beacon II is very similar, but it's smaller and takes 127 film.  The Beacon 225, like the Beacon II, has a collapsible lens box that snaps into place when pulled away from the body. Then, the shutter will fire.  The Beacon 225 takes 12  6x6 cm images on 620 roll film.  The shutter speeds are Instant and Bulb, with aperture settings for sunny (\"brite\") (f/16?) and cloudy (\"dull\") (f/8?).  The lens is a 70 mm coated doublet.  There is a tripod thread on the bottom of the camera.  The red window in the back is set in a rectangular frame. The camera is mostly black plastic of some sort, and is actually rather attractive.  It collapses to a respectable size that would fit into a coat pocket.On March 20, I shot the roll of Verichrome Pan, mostly along the beach in Muskegon, MI.  The wind was really gusty, and sand was blowing all over the place.  What better conditions to use a cheap camera?I developed the Verichrome Pan in D-76 1:1 for 9 minutes.  Overall,  I am quite pleased with the results, and the subject matter was perfectly suited to this camera."},
{"title": "6x6 Folding Cameras", "date": "Sunday, March 13, 2016", "text": "Agfa Isolette 4.56x6 Folding CamerasWhen I first started getting serious about being a photographer, I picked up a medium-format (120 film) folding bellows camera for something like $15.  It was an early version Agfa Isolette which surprised me with the quality of the images I got from it.  That was back around 2000-2001, and the camera was probably given to someone over the years.  I have had a few other 6x6 and 6 x 4.5 folding cameras, as well as 6x9 folders.  In my opinion, a 6x6 folder is the optimal MF pocketable camera.  You get the full benefit of the square negative, portability, and 12 exposures/roll.  While a 6x9 cm folder will give you more film real estate, you also have a larger camera, and many of the cameras available are quite old, with problematic bellows, and the additional problem of anything Kodak probably needing 620 film. There are a plethora of folding cameras out there by Balda, Franka, Certo, Voigtlander, Zeiss-Ikon, Kodak, and Agfa, to name a few.  Here, I want to focus on only 6x6 folders, which I believe offer the best value and ease of use.For some reason, there are fewer choices for 6x6 folding cameras, and your most common examples available are those made by Agfa and Ansco.  Most of the models are post WWII, made from 1946-1960.Ansco Speedex The Speedex B2 and Standard and the Speedex Jr. were made in USA. The Speedex B2 (B2 was the Ansco film size = 120) appeared in 1940, and featured ½ sec - 1/250 shutter, + B.   The standard Speedex appeared ca. 1950, and featured an f/6.3 - 22 lens, B, ½ - 1/100 shutter speed, and a black plastic top deck. Speedex Special - ca. 1952, had an Agfa Apotar f/4.5 lens and Prontor shutter. Speedex Jr. - 1945-48, 1 shutter speed. Basically, a folding box camera. Super Speedex - 1953-58, couples rangefinder, Solina 75mm f/3.5 lens, Synchro Compur shutter with 1 sec - 1/500 (same as the Agfa Super Isolette). In 1953 it sold for $120. Ansco Titan - Ansco Anastigmat 90mm lens  with f/4.5 lens, 1/2 sec - 1/400, T, B. 1949. Agfa Isolette (sometimes spelled Jsolette)Agfa Isolette - The original model was made from 1938-1942, and was dual format with a mask and two red windows for 6x4.5 and 6x6 negatives.  There are various lens and shutter combinations. 1960 was the last year of manufacture. Isolette 4.5 - (1945-1950) 6x6 only.  Apotar f/4.5- f/22, 8.5 cm lens in Compur-Rapid or Prontor-S shutters. 1-1/500 sec, T, B. Isolette I - (1951-58) Vario Shutter, B, 1/25, 1/50, 1/200; Agnar 85mm f/4.5 lens. PC sync on rim of shutter. Isolette II - (1950-1960) Prontor-S shutter, B - 1/300, Apotar f/4.5 85mm lens. Isolette III - (1952-1958) uncoupled rangefinder, Solinar or Apotar lens, Synchr-Compur  (B, 1- 1/500 sec) or Pronto shutter, B - 1/25 - 1/200 Isolette V  - (1950-52) 85mm Agnar f/4.5 lens, Vario Synchro shutter, B, 1/25, 1/75, 1/200 sec. Isolette L - (1957-1960) can use 35mm or 120, uncoupled meter, Pronto Synchro shutter, Apotar f/4.5 lens, B, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100, 1/200 sec. While many of these cameras are quite usable, the one single problem that most have is the green grease that was used on the focus helical has solidified.  This usually requires some dis-assembly, and use of Naptha to free up the helical.  In some cases, you may think the helical is working, but you are only turning the lens via loosened mounting screws.  Once you have a free-moving helical, and if the lenses are clear and shutter is firing properly, you’ll have an excellent pocket 120 film camera.Ansco Speedex, ca. 2003Things to check for in buying any folding camera: Pinholes in the bellows Fungus or haze on the lenses Properly working shutter Focus mechanism Clean interior. Winding knob turns freely. Using a 6x6 folder is quite easy - press the release button to drop the bed and the self-erecting lensboard pops up and extends the bellows.   Figure out your distance, aperture and shutter speed for four situation, cock the shutter and fire.  Advance film to the next frame, and repeat. While these lenses are not as fast as most TLR cameras, they are probably going to produce excellent results at F/8 and smaller apertures, anyway.  Most of the Ansco/Agfa 6x6 cameras feature a “cold shoe” on the top deck, which can hold a rangefinder attachment or a  flash with a PC connector.  The Isolettes have an array of lens/shutter combinations that often have a PC connector for flashbulb, and later, X-sync.  Any single model will have several variations.Ricoh Six ImageOther ManufacturersBalda, Certo-Six, Franka Solida, Ricoh-Six, Voigtlander Perkeo, Zeiss Ikonta , Zeiss Nettar, Zeiss Nettax.  There are as multitude of confusing names and features in the Zeiss-Ikon family, and the Ikonta B is a place to start exploring. Luckily, the majority of 6x6 folders were made in Europe, so 120 film usage is a certainty in those cameras.PricesPrices are all over the place for the Isolettes, but the higher-end models will always command more money.  Most sellers do not know what model Isolette or Speedex they are selling, so carefully examine the images to see what model you are bidding on. Go to Certo6 and Camera-Wiki to get more information on the various models."},

Will another company take over production the way the Impossible Project did?  I wouldn't hold my breath.  It's a niche market. Fuji is making a ton of money on its Instax film.  They have the market cornered there.   The newest pack-film cameras are 15 years old or so, and the film represents a small percentage of sales.

{"title": "The Argoflex E and 120 film", "date": "Sunday, February 07, 2016", "text": "Argus (located right here in Ann Arbor, MI) started producing a twins lens reflex camera before WWII, and the first model was the Argoflex E (1940-42).   It is a Bakelite-bodied camera with gear-coupled taking and viewing lenses, and actually very similar to  the Voigtlander Focusing Brilliant TLR.  The Argoflex E can use 620 and 120 film in the pre-war model, which can be easily distinguished from the post-war version by the presence of a small spindle knob on the upper left side of the earlier camera.  The post-war  version merely has a circular piece of trim in the same spot.   Film is wound with the advance knob on the right side, and you look through the red window (which has a turnable shield) to watch the film advance.The Argoflex E has a 75mm f/4.5 Varex Anastigmat lens (uncoated in pre-war version).  The shutter speeds are 1/10 – 1/200, sec, plus B and T.  Apertures range from f/4.5-f/18.  There is a place to screw in a remote release on the rim of the shutter housing.    The viewing lens features a depth of field scale that you can view from above. The post-war Argoflex E (1946-1948) can also use 120 film, contrary to Henry Gambino's assertion in Argomania. Of course, with Argus always tweaking things, it's possible that some cameras made later in the cycle do not accept 120 in the supply side of the camera.  The post-war Argoflex E also has a coated lens, which should help with flare. The Argoflex E does not have double-exposure prevention, so it can be used to make multiple exposures.  For some, that may make it a very ideal TLR.What about other Argoflex models?After Argus shelved  the Argoflex II and replaced it with the Argoflex EM (1948) and EF (1948-1951), these metal-bodied cameras took only 620 film, and 120 film spools cannot be used in them.The later Argoflexes do not have coupled taking and viewing lenses, and except for the Argus Super 75 and the Argus 40, do not have adjustments except for “Instant” and “Time.”  None of these models can use 120 film rolls. So, the Argoflex E is certainly still a usable camera, and since it readily accepts 120 film, it's worth a try.  Some things to look for and to be aware of, though.  Number one is the reflex mirror, which is now  over 70 years old, and may be de-silvering or corroded, or just very dusty, depending on where the camera was kept all this time.  In other words, the image in the viewfinder will not be as bright as that of a Rollei or a Yashicamat.   The shutters appear to be fairly dependable, but remember that these are old cameras, so they could be sluggish.  The lenses may also need cleaning if they are hazy.  In addition, the lack of coated lenses will probably give you less-contrast in the image. One remedy would be to find a UV filter that can slip in place over the taking lens (there is no threaded filter ring). The Argoflex E is certainly as better camera than the Kodak reflex cameras, all of which require 620 film.Should you buy one?  I would say it depends on the condition of the camera and of course, the price.  While not as complex or as well engineered as cameras from the 50s - 70s, it can  produce sharp images when stopped down.  Depending on the lens condition, wide-open quality will vary.  The reflex mirror's age will also produce a dimmer image in the viewfinder, but using the pop-up magnifier may help with focus.  I would not pay more than $40 for one.On  February 6, the A3C3 met up at Matthaei Botanical gardens.  I shot a roll of Ilford Delta 100 in the Argoflex E, and developed it in D76, 1:1.   Overall, my light-meter estimation worked pretty well, and the images came out better than expected. Here are a few.During the transition from film to digital, many different manufacturers produced some very full-featured small point and shoot 35mm cameras.  Nikon's line of One Touch cameras, begun in the early 1980s, continued  with the One Touch Zoom 90s in 2002.  This compact P&S features:38-90 zoom range (f/4.8 - 10.5)uses 1 CR2 3v batterymacro mode (as close as 12 inches) different flash modes (auto flash, anytime flash, flash cancel, slow sync and red-eye reduction)self-timerQD- quartz date for time/date stamping imagesSet infinity focus with no flashThe plastic-bodied camera in the same sort of champagne-aluminum finish as the Nikon N60 and some other consumer models, is lightweight, attractive, and has enough features for the snapshot shooter.  From Nikon's press release in 2002:\"Not only does it feature a new slightly thinner, lighter look -- the One•Touch Zoom 90s gives basic zoom picture-taking an extra touch of creativity and flexibility, Nikon style. The 2.4x zoom lens lets users frame subjects with ease within a 38-90mm range. Versatile flash accommodates most shooting conditions. Macro mode allows shooting as close as 30cm (12 in.) from the subject. Fully automatic operation makes it especially easy not to miss a photo opportunity, so everyone can enjoy taking pictures more.\"That pretty much summarizes the camera's features and market.    From the Nikon site, here are the specifications:Lens:  38-90mm f/4.8-10.5,  5 elements in 5 groupsShutter speed:  2.6 to 1/250 sec.Viewfinder information Image size frame marks (with parallax compensation marks); Autofocus spot; Green LED indicators -- Lights up: Ready to shoot, Blinks: Flash being charged.Focusing Activated by lightly pressing shutter release buttonThe shutter cannot be released when the subject is closer than 0.7m (2.3 ft.), 0.3 to 0.7m (1.0 to 2.3 ft.) in Macro mode (Macro button blinks);Infinity Focus mode availableFlash fires automatically if the available light is low; Daylight Sync Flash can be activatedFilm speed setting ISO100, 200, 400 and 800 film automatically set.  ISO100 is automatically selected for non-DX-coded filmsDate imprint function (90s QD only) Printed date include Year, Month, Day, Hour, (24-hour cycle with no AM/PM) and Minute;  Leap year adjustment until 2049; Incremental correction of date;Power source: One 3V CR2025 lithium batteryDimensions (W x H x D) Approx. 117 x 64.5 x 49mm (4.6 x 2.5 x 2.0 in.)Approx. 117 x 64.5 x 53mm (4.6 x 2.5 x 2.1 in.) (90s QD)Weight (without battery) Approx. 215g (7.6 oz.);Approx. 225g (7.9 oz.) (90s QD)So, the obvious question is, how well does this camera perform?  It does fit comfortably in a jacket pocket, and I found it easiest to set it at the widest setting of 38mm and lock the infinity setting, which makes it more usable as a sort of street camera.  I did not try the macro setting, but when the macro button is depressed, it blinks to let you know, and the flash goes off every time you shoot.I loaded a roll of Agfa Vista 200 (made by Fuji) and took the camera with me to the Toledo Museum of Art last weekend.  I developed the film in a Unicolor 3-step C-41 kit.  Overall I think the images are pretty good. Not as sharp as I would like, but I have no idea what aperture the camera uses, since it's all auto.Overall, I could not find too much to find fault with.  It's a medium-range camera that will give good results, and obviously, the more experienced photographer will find ways to make the best use of the various modes.  The downside is the limited ISO range of 100-800, as well as the top shutter speed of 1/250 sec.  However, considering that I paid 50 cents for it, it was money well-spent. Now, imagine if that was a digicam from 2002 - it would have been about 2.1 MP -- and you would be kicking yourself for not using film at the time."},
{"title": "Point and Shoot Review: Pentax IQZoom 120Mi", "date": "Wednesday, February 03, 2016", "text": "Last month I picked up a bunch of P&S 35mm cameras for Less than a buck apiece.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s various manufacturers were trying to woo customers with P&S cameras that were ever smaller, and contained more advanced technology.  Some of the APS cameras  at the time had very sophisticated electronics as a prelude to the digital onslaught, and most of those features and compactness made it over to the 35mm world.  First of all, you can pack an amazing amount of advanced features on integrated chips, but you still need room for the film cassette, winding motors, and the lens.   Short-range zooms such as 35-80mm were the typical focal length in many of the 35mm P&S cameras.  However, Pentax produced the IQZoom 120Mi, with a zoom range of 38-120mm.  This camera ranks as one of the more compact models, and despite the zoom range is surprisingly svelte.  It has a metal body, and reminds me a bit of the Rollei Prego models that were out at the time. The size is 4.1\"L x 2.5\" H x 1.7\"D, and weighs about 8 ounces. It definitely feels like a metal camera.The 40-page manual is a necessity, if you want to know about all of the features and modes that this camera has available.  Fortunately, the camera came in the original box with manual and looks like it had never been used. It requites a 3V CR-2 battery (buy them in bulk online!) and the well-marked off/on switch opens the lens cover and the lens extends slightly from the body when you turn on the camera.  There is an adjustable diopter in the viewfinder, which ia quite nice to have.  Four small buttons across the top deck below the LCD control the flash, exposures modes, remote and self-timer, and AF focus.  You can actually set it to infinity for faster street shooting.  There is a button to turn on the date/time imprinting. Auto DX-coding from 25-3200 ISO, and if you load a film cartridge without DX coding, the ISO is automatically set to 25.   Focus is 2.15 feet to infinity, with phase-matching passive 5-point AF system. Spot AF is also an option.The shutter can be set to B mode, and will stay open as long as you depress the shutter.  You can also have the flash go off in B mode for interesting effects.  There are other shutter speed modes, such as Slow shutter speed with flash off, and Slow-speed Flash Sync.  Red-eye reduction can be turned on.With any of these compact P&S zooms, the electronic zoom is fairly slow to extend to 120mm and retract to 38mm.  If this camera had only a 35mm 2.8 lens, it would be a work of art.   The max aperture is f/4.8 at 35mm and f/12.5 at 120mm.  So, yes, fast film is a must if you are going to be zooming out. An added bonus is the bottom switch that can turn on the Panorama mask, which is actually fun to use.  Make sure you deselect that mode if you want to short the entire frame.Likes: compact size and finish, controls, and image quality.Dislikes: Battery life, slow optics.When new, these cameras were about $200.  This looks very much like a digicam from the front and top.   It fits easily into a pocket, andI shot a roll of Kodak Tri-X, and I think the results were quite good.  Most of the shots were taken at 38mm.Bruno and Christy at CameraMall (with flash)construction on campusalleyat 120mmpanorama mode"},
{"title": "TIME Machine.", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2016", "text": "By SqueakyMarmot from Vancouver, Canada  via Wikimedia CommonsWell, sort of. I am going through more boxes of prints and negatives again.  I found this lovely little packet of images from a bona-fide Time camera that I took in March, 2007 on a roll of Kodak Gold 100.  Many things have changed in town since.  The Anberay Apartments on East University Avenue were later torn down and replaced with a high-rise apartment building filled with students spending a ton of $$ to live there.  The Village Apothecary on South University recently closed. Walgreens replaced the bookstore, which was a big loss to anyone needing art supplies.Yes, a camera is a sort of time machine, and this TIME camera did okay and recorded some images that show some things that are no longer.  The people change daily, but buildings create the landscape, and when the landscape changes, it's all too easy to forget what was once there.  If you are not familiar with the TIME Camera, it was a dirt-cheap plastic camera made to look like something slightly better. It was given away as a premium for subscribing to Time magazine back in the 1980s.  It has a single-element  fixed-focus 50mm lens with apertures of f/6, 8, 11, and 16.  A metal weight in the bottom gives the camera more heft.    It also has a hot shoe for a flash.  That's it.  The Toledo Museum of Art is showing a nice little exhibition of photographs of the American West - \"The American West - Photographs of a new Frontier,\" which runs until late May 2016.  All of the photographs are from the TMA collection, and span the early days of Timothy O'Sullivan, Carleton F. Watkins and William Henry Jackson, to the more contemporary Frank Gohlke and Howard Bond.  In between, there are a lot of albumin prints by Frank Jay Haynes of Yellowstone and other parks.  (Haynes was the official photographer of the Northern Pacific Railway, and the Haynes images were donated to TMA by Bill Becker, a somewhat local antiquarian image expert and collector.)  There are also a selection of stereo views and a viewer. The stereo views were a booming business in the late 1800s - early 1900s, offering the public an opportunity to see these amazing places in b&w 3-D.  Of course, the stereos also were a way to attract tourists to the wonderful attractions of the far west, and especially, Yellowstone.    The exhibit also features a couple of beautiful photogravures of Native Americans by the unmatched efforts of Edward S. Curtis.    Moving more towards the present, there are examples from Manual Alvarez Bravo (Window on the Agave is a gem of a photograph), Laura Gilpin, William Clift, and others. Of course, no exhibit would be complete without something from Ansel Adams, and I think the examples that the TMA used are perfect in expressing the range of subject and treatment by Adams, with some personal favorites: Moonrise over Hernandez, Grand Tetons and Snake River, and Clearing Winter Storm.    There are two photographs by Edward Weston, and certainly not examples of his best, but Tomales Bay is an example of form that so interested him.  Brett Weston's Mendenhall Glacier is a fine example of his work with contrasty subjects, reflections, patterns, and abstraction.  The images from Frank Gohlke -  in the modern era, are really beautiful and haunting, even when they are showing the destructive effects of Mt. St. Helens.  The exhibit does a pretty good job of showing the evolution of not only the photographic process, but also of the the documentary style of the early landscapes to the more nuanced and interpretive images of more recent photographers.  Early on, photographers such as O'Sullivan and Jackson were confronted with an unparalleled opportunity to document the awesome landscapes of the West. Those early images led to protecting places such as Yellowstone and Yosemite.  The power of the photograph was far better than words or paintings to convince Congress how those amazing and unique places were deserving of becoming National Parks. On the technology side of things -- it is hard to imagine the effort that was needed to make wet-plate photographs (and not tiny ones. either) of the west.  We take a lot for granted now. However, the large-format camera rules in extracting the detail and grand scale of the western landscape.  Take a trip to the Toledo Museum of Art and see the West through the lens of those that were there over the last 150 years. The TMA has a great place to eat lunch, including beer and wine right on the premises. If you are there before the end of February, you'll also want to see a small exhibit called \"The City\" in the print gallery, and it features etchings, block prints, and photographs of various cities."},
{"title": "Going Back in Time", "date": "Sunday, January 17, 2016", "text": "A few weeks ago, while I was off on holiday break, I had some time to go through some of the \"shoeboxes\" of film shot back in 2000-2002.  Four boxes of 4x6 (mostly) color prints and negatives that for the most part, have sat there, and have not been scanned or shared.  As I went through them, I realized how much better a photographer I am now than back then.  Some sets of tossed in the trash as there were no images really worth saving.  In 1999-2000, I was starting anew with a passion for photography, learning as much as I could, using better cameras, and hopefully better technique.  I shot a lot on color print film, and did not start developing my own b&w until 2001.  Even so, I shot a lot of images that are just crappy by my current standards.  Lack of good focus, subject position, bad lighting, uninteresting images, etc.  I am sure at the time, I thought some of them were okay. However, I was learning by shooting.  Color film was fairly inexpensive and so was processing at the local stores.   One thing is for sure, some of the images were better after I scanned them in and adjusted them to my preferences.  Overall though, I was learning to \"see,\" to compose, and eventually, after many years I am a much more sophisticated photographer.  Compare this to being a musician, and it's similar.  Same for any art form.  We improve by doing. Until we actually practice, we don't improve.  Whether its shooting every day, drawing every day, playing every day, we improve over time.  We develop a more sophisticated ear, a better vision of our end product, and our imagination is able to produce something because we have taken control of the tools, improved our education about our craft, and have made our tools an extension of our talent. Of course, one can say that it's easier with digital.  It's just easier to take shitty banal images and fill up a hard drive with them.  The envelopes of 4x6 prints remind me of where I was, and how much better I am now.  I have a better grasp of aesthetics, moods, composition, and so much more than I did 15 years ago.  I should be happy with that, but I know that I can still be better.  That's part of being an artist of any sort. Complacency leads to mediocrity. Always test yourself in some way-- find new challenges, new projects, new techniques.  THE CAMERA DOES NOT MATTER.  It's the gray matter between your ears that will make you a better photographer.  The limitations that you set for yourself are your barriers.  I know this to be true, and not some phrase plucked from the internet. What do you want to do with your photography?  Why are you not doing it?  List the things that keep you back, and address them.  Fear is the biggest reason for many of us.  Fear of how people will react, fear of the unknown, fear of failure.  You have to learn by doing.  Do it until you get over your fears, and you will see improvement.I'm 59 now, and  I wish I had worked harder on photography while in my 20s-30s, I had to eventually get serious about photography in my 40s.  In knowing what I know now, I missed a lot of opportunities to document changes that have taken place.  My interpretation of changes, anyways. Back to the boxes of photographs.  I'll winnow those down, keeping the images that depict family, friends, significant events or places.  A lot of the nature images are crappy stuff.  They served the purpose of learning what I needed to, and if they are not good enough to keep, into the trash they go.Taken in 2002, with a Contax G1 on Ilford XP-2.

{"title": "Different Tools in the Bag(s)", "date": "Saturday, January 02, 2016", "text": "If you could could see the series of camera bags I have lined up and opened them, you would see different bags with different camera, lenses, etc. Each bag has a different body and a set of lenses to go with that particular body.  Most are Nikon, but not all. One bag holds a Minolta X700, another a Mamiya C330 TLR and two sets of lenses.  Another holds a Pentax Spotmatic F.  The rotating Crappy Camera Bag might have a Yashica A TLR, along with a Holga or a Russkie Zenit 12XP and a Diana mini.  I call it the \"rotating\" camera bag, because it changes almost monthly, as to what cameras it contains. Nikon FE and 3-lens kitHowever, one of my bags has one camera and three lenses that rarely changes in the lens makeup. This bag holds a Nikon FE with a 50mm f/2 lens, 24mm f/2.8, and the wonderful 105mm 2.5 Nikkor.  I call this my perfect lens trio  - a normal lens, a good wide-angle, and a short telephoto/portrait lens. In addition, it holds 52mm filters (Nikon standard)- red, orange, yellow, a 2-stop ND, and polarizer; remote release cable, business and model release cards, notepad, microfiber cloth, and spare button cells.  There is enough space in the bag to throw in something extra, such as a Holga or a Yashica TLR, or maybe a 180mm 2.8 lens.   In short, it's a versatile tool bag for making photographs.   I could throw in my Fuji X-100s for a digital option, with room for the Olympus Trip 35. Fuji X100SLet me elaborate on the last two cameras a bit.  I bought the Fuji X100S back in June, when I could no longer resist the siren call of the Fuji cameras.  CameraMall had some white-box X100S cameras, and I bought one.  I have never regretted that purchase. The X100s features an APS-C sized sensor - just like my Nikon DSLRs, and a fixed 35mm f/2.0 equivalent lens.  Street photography, yes.  Even though the camera has excellent controls that pretty much mimic a film camera, there is so much more to this camera that I have come to learn  about and love over the passing months with it.  It has some quirks, of course, and like any digital camera, there are layers and layers of options and controls set in the menu, and I know that I am not using all of them to the full extent of what is there.  However, if I were taking a trip via air and could only bring one camera, the Fuji X100S would be the camera. The second camera is the Olympus Trip 35, which I have already written about.  It has become an essential camera as well, and so long as I work within its limitations, I get very good images.  It just never fails to please me with the results.So, that's starting the year off with a gear post.  Everyone has their favorite camera bodies/lens combos  for particular reasons.  You may wonder why I chose the Nikon FE over an FM of FM2N, etc.  The FE's aperture-priority is usually how I shoot, but it also offers full manual control.  It's also a small SLR, and works just the way I like."},
{"title": "It's the Holiday Season", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2015", "text": "Holiday Flash BrownieNow that I can develop my own C-41, it's given me the chance to catch up on some larger roll-film developing, and this roll of Kodak Portra 160 that was respooled for 127 had been sitting on my shelf since after World Toy Camera Day (back in early October).   I shot it in a Kodak Brownie Holiday Flash, an unassuming little Bakelite camera that has been sitting on my shelf, as well. As far as 127 goes, it's a full-frame model, meaning that the negatives are ca. 4x6 cm, giving 8 shots per roll. This camera has a Dakon lens, so it was manufactured  between 1955 and 1963.I didn't know what to expect from this little camera, but I took it out for a walk to peach Mountain Observatory near Dexter, MI, and it turns out that it may have given me the best images for WTCD that I've taken in a while.It certainly qualifies as a toy camera, as there is only a shutter button for control.  That's as rudimentary as any box camera.  The Holiday Flash Brownie also has a glass cousin, a Christmas tree ornament that I bought about 5 years ago. It's one ofmy favorite ornaments, and looks very much like the real thing.So, I developed the roll of Portra today, and I was astonished at how good the negatives were.  I don't have any film holders for 127, so I simply used the area mask in my V700 scanner, laid the negs emulsion-side down, and covered them with a sheet of 8x10 glass to flatten them out.  I had to tweak the orientation a bit, but overall, the scans came out quite good.  Peach Mountain is mostly UM property, and there is a radio astronomy observatory, as well as a Lowbrow Astronomers Observatory with a 24\" optical telescope, and an abandoned UM observatory. All make for some interesting images.  The sunny day and open shade did not thwart the Portra 160's latitude.  I can see why this film was used in school portrait cameras, which is where the bulk rolls of Portra 160 come from.Here is a screen capture of the negatives, followed by some of the scans."},
{"title": "My First Foray into Home C-41 Developing!", "date": "Friday, December 25, 2015", "text": "I don't know about others, but even though I have been developing my own b&w film for many, many years, I hesitated about trying to develop C-41 or E-6 films at home.  Like so many things, it's the fear of the unknown and of course, fear of screwing it up. So many steps, and the temperatures... how can I even try this?  I suppose someone that has never developed b&w film might feel the same way before doing so, and consequently realizing it was actually fairly easy.So, with some urging by my super pals, Leslie and Mike, I ordered a couple of Unicolor C-41  kits from the FPP store. For $19 a kit, it's a pretty cheap experiment, and it's only a 3-step process. The fun fact here is that the kits are manufactured in Dexter Michigan, by Photo Systems, Inc. I have driven past the place many times over the years without giving it a thought!1-L C-41 kit from FPPI opened the first kit and carefully read the directions.  All the chems are dry and need to be mixed to 1L final amounts.  I highly recommend doing this mixing AND the developing with proper PPO - gloves, lab coat or apron, and eye protection.  It's not that the stuff is dangerous, but you are mixing  chemicals, after all.  Make sure that you have 3 clean plastic 1L bottles for the Developer, Blix, and Stabilizer solutions. I suggest the brown plastic darkroom containers. Make sure each one is labeled properly as to the contents. You can even put a (1) for the Developer, a (2) for the Blix and a (3) for the Stabilizer, in case you are worried about not doing things in the right sequence.  The Blix is a combination bleach and fix, and is probably the most caustic of the things you will deal with.Temperature -- I use a deep plastic tub with hot water in it to bring the final temps of the Developer and Blix to 102°F.  The pre-soak (1 minute) should also be around the same temp.  Having several dial-type thermometers is very useful for monitoring the temps.  When doing the developing, make sure you immerse the tank into the tub to maintain the developer temp.  After finishing the Blix step, wash the film in water that is between 95°F and 105°F.  The Stabilizer is room temp., and is the very last step.  From Leslie, I got the tip to use a microfiber cloth wetted with Stabilizer to wipe down the back of the film (NOT the emulsion side) to avoid spotting (added in edit -- THIS IS AFTER removing the film from the Stabilizer bath. I found I was getting spots on the film side upon drying).After each step, pour the Developer, Blix and Stabilizer back into their respective containers for re-use. This is not a 1-shot process.  Each liter should be good for at least 10 rolls of film. You will need to \"burp\" the Blix after each set of inversions, as it generates some gas during its part of the process.  I use Jobo tanks and reels, so the top plastic seal just needs to be loose after the inversion set.My initial fears were quite unfounded, as my film came out very good.  My first roll was some long-expired Kodak HD 400, and the results were what one might expect from old film.  My second and third rolls were fresh Kodak 200, and the results were excellent.  So, I am now doing my owwn color developing.  E-6 is next, and the temperatures are not as high as C-41.

{"title": "New Acquisition!  The Classic Retina Automatic III", "date": "Wednesday, December 09, 2015", "text": "Last week I was downtown, checking out Antelope Antiques on Liberty.  The store usually has some cameras for sale, and every once in a while I find  something there that I buy.  The Kodak cameras I usually see are Ponies, ugly as sin Kodak 35s, and Brownies of some sort.  This time, I found a Kodak Retina Automatic III.  I have owned or handled a bunch of Retinas over the years, and still have a Retina IIa, a solid, wonderful 35mm camera.  The Retina Automatic III (1961-1963) features a 45mm f/2.8 Schneider Xenar lens, shutter-priority automation controlled by a Gossen selenium meter, as well as manual control. Shutter speeds are B, 1/30-1/500 sec. There is PC- flash sync, a cold shoe, and a pretty nice coupled rangefinder. The camera has lots of chrome, and is a typical late 1950s to early 60s build.  The film advance is on the bottom, making it quite easy to use.  I put a roll of Svema FN64 in it, and did some test shots around campus in A mode, to see what kind of automated exposure I was getting.  After I developed the film, it was clear that the metering is likely off, as the shots taken in full sun were badly overexposed.  I'll shoot another roll under full manual using an external meter and see how things turn out. The camera is quite easy to use, and feels pretty good in the hands.  This particular example is in like-new condition, and I suspect being kept in the leather case all these years was one reason.  I doubt the original owner used it much, judging by the pristine condition.A few examples from the test roll:"},
{"title": "Svema FN-64 - try this film!", "date": "Thursday, November 26, 2015", "text": "I have been using various b&w films over the many years of my photography. Some of them have come and gone, only to pop up in small quantities long after they have been discontinued, such Panatomic-X, which remains one of my favorite slow-speed b&w films.  The problem with some of these finds is that it's a small quantity, and I am using long-outdated film.  Someone else may have different results because their film wasn't stored properly over the years.  So, while using outdated film is an adventure, it's certainly not something I recommend for serious work, or repeatable results. What then, about some of the oddball films out there?  The Film Photography Project's Mike Raso has been an incredible sniffer-outer of some unusual film stocks in large quantities.  Last year, he was able to import a lot of 35mm film manufactured by Svema, the Ukrainian film company.  For most of us, Svema 64 was a film we had only seen in the guise of outdated single rolls from Russian sources.  I once shot a roll that dated from the 1970s. Then, the FPP started selling a slew of Svema films, ranging from ultra-slow ISO3 to Svema 200, and the Svema 125 color film (also a real favorite). The new  Svema films are all on polyester or PET bases, making them exceptionally resistant to curling after development. That makes them scan beautifully, with everything being perfectly flat.  Some of them are on a very thin base (Svema 100) that is also super strong (reviewed here).  The Svema color 125 has a muted \"old-school\" color palette that I find very likable, and quite different from the supersaturated Fuji colors.  I highly recommend it for portraits. However, my favorite Svema film is the FN-64.  At an ISO of 64, it's not super slow nor really fast, and is a good choice for many situations.   I have been using it a lot in my Olympus Trip 35, and the results have been very good.  I use Rodinal to develop it at 1:25 for 6.5 minutes, and the negatives are very impressive to me.  Some grain, and of course other developers will give different results. The Massive Development Chart has plenty of information to guide you on that.A few examples from the Olympus Trip 35:somewhere in WisconsinUM campus diag, Ann ArborMUM building, Ann ArborMinneapolis reflectionsHyatt Regency hotel, MinneapolisThe wonderful aspect to all this is that this film is fresh-dated, and is available in quantity. The bulk rolls of 100 feet are a bargain.  I highly recommend trying the FN-64.  I have yet to make any darkroom prints from it, but I will be doing so this winter.   You can always but a couple of  rolls and see how you like it.  I think you'll be pleased with the result."},

I found this Wall Street Journal article on the Holga factory, which is quite interesting.  Hand-assembled.  Maybe they cost more to make than I thought. In doing some searches, I found this blog, which showcased some of my work from 2012!After reading the FB post, I went online to Amazon and bought a spare for $31.  I'll leave that one in the box until I actually need to use it. The plain old Holga 120N -- my favorite.  You may love this article I found from 2012.So, stock up while you can.  In 2002, I paid $15 for a Holga, and now they are over $30 each.   You can also buy a true bargain, the Debonair Camera from the FPP store for the very reasonable price of $19.99.UPDATE:  It's official.

(I also used a 25mm c-mount lens with an adjustable aperture, and while both give me very desirable effects, the 16mm gives me the vignetting.  Examples from both lenses are below.)There is only the one wide-open aperture setting, and the lens focuses from about 2 feet to infinity. I have to use the 1J1 in totally Manual mode, as well.  This combination gives me exactly the kind of dreamy, slightly vignetted images that are sharp at the center and fall off towards the edges.  No software is involved in making the images I like, and straight out of the camera images look like they were done with a cheap toy camera, but better. I love this combo so much,  that I may just use it like this most of the time.  Obviously it's not great for every subject, but it makes some deliciously soft images that perfectly (to me, at least) provide the emotive reaction I had when shooting the scenes in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.    Sometimes it takes a happy accident to point out a direction one should take, and I might not have shot with the 1J1 nearly as much if the SLR had been working reliably.  Adjusting my vision accordingly, the Nikon 1J1 with the c-mount lens provided me with a creative tool that enable me to come back with some different images than I would have shot with the SLR.Eagle River, WILand O' Lakes, WIwhat the sign saysgrassy dunes at AuTrain Bay, MIAuTrain beachAuTrain bayVilas Theater, Eagle River, WI"},

Although Michigan has been my home for the past 34 years, my first 24 were spent in NY.  Born in Watertown, grew up pretty much in Parishville (at the edge of the Adirondacks), and went to college in Syracuse.  My wife Adrienne is from Amenia, in Dutchess Co., about 2 hrs N of New York City.  So for me, anything below Syracuse is \"down-state.\"I intended this trip to be primarily a photo trip, visiting places where I lived many years ago, and to explore some new spots, too.  Some of it was visiting my in-laws in Amenia, and yes, it was a lot of driving.  We put 1,958 miles on during this trip, and my 4-cylinder 2009 Ford Escape carried us along quite well with a max Avg. MPG of 33 mpg and a low of about 29. Equipment-wise, I packed relatively simply for a change.  Two bags.  Bag one had a Nikon FM2N, 24mm, 50mm and 105 mm lenses; Leica M2 w/35mm 1.4 lens; Yashica A TLR.  Bag 2 had my Nikon F100, 24-50mmm, 85mm 1.8, and 180mm 2.8 lenses, flash, various filters.  Also in the bag was my Olympus Trip 35, a Diana mini, and a Holga.  One digital camera -- my Fuji X100S was used as well to supplement the film shots.  The F100 was used for shooting slide film, and the FM2N was used with b&w.  Most of the B&W films were Ilford.  Over the course of 8 days I shot 15 rolls of film and a several hundred digi shots.some film to be processedend of the day on 10/21We left Ann Arbor on 10/19, choosing to take Rt. 80 throgh Ohio and PA, and then drop down to 86 (17) once we were in NY.  That meant we were by-passing the NYS thruway through Buffalo and Rochester, and on smaller roads to see what was there, which is my preferred way to travel when I am not in a hurry.  We entered at State Line, NY (really that is the name of the place), and ended up in Westfield, NY.  Along the way we encountered mile after mile of vineyards, and Westfield is where C.E. Welch moved his company to in 1897.  An imposing brick building in Westfield was erected in 1910 by Welch.  We stopped there and I walked a bit around the town and shot with the Fuji.  A small diner caught my eye, but we were not yet ready for lunch.Small towns are almost always interesting places to explore -- some have charm, and some lack it in abundance. Westfield has charm.  The downtown was pretty active for a Monday morning, and a smattering of small shops were open.The town has a small \"town square\" that was quite pretty.The town hall.I don't know if Welch is still a big player in the town, but I suspect that many of the grapes grown nearby end up in their jams or juice.The next part will have detail on the trip to northern NY from Syracuse.  Stay tuned.Gotta love the old signs."},

The FPP Comes to Ann Arbor.", "date": "Thursday, October 08, 2015", "text": "Many months ago, Mike Raso of the Film Photography Project asked me if I thought Ann Arbor would be a good spot to hold a one-day photowalk, and if the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club would be interested in assisting/participating.  I immediately said \"Yes!\"  I knew that people would love photographing here, and the added attraction of the Argus Museum would be another plus.  So, we made the plans, Leslie Lazenby  and I got together and coordinated  the schedule, and hoped for the best.  Nearly 60 people pre-registered for the FPP Ann Arbor PhotoWalk, which was held on October 3. On Friday, Oct. 2, Mike Raso met me downtown for lunch, and that evening, Leslie, Mike, and I stuffed the goody bags for the attendees and firmed up what we would be doing the next day.  Saturday dawned chilly, windy, and a possibility of rain.  Undaunted, photographers started showing up at our rendezvous point at CameraMall before 9:30 am.  Desmond, Craig, and Christy were there to greet us with hot coffee, doughnuts, water, apples, granola bars, and more.  People were thrilled to have a real camera store to shop at and come in from the cool weather, and the place really had a vibe going. Eventually, we split into several smaller groups, led by A3C3 members, and headed around the campus area and downtown to show off our town and get people shooting away.  Film cameras were clicking, from Dianas to Hasselblads.  It was a fun group of people-- some coming from as far away as California, Vancouver, North Carolina, Tennessee, Ontario, Minnesota, and New Jersey.  The participants were in good spirits the entire day, and while the weather got us damp, nobody complained.After we split up for lunch, we then reassembled at 2:30 at our second rendezvous, the Argus Museum.  It is the ONLY camera museum that is in the same building where the cameras were once made.  Cheryl Chidester and her volunteers had cider and doughnuts and other treats ready for the group.  There is a new exhibit in the gallery called \"Alchemy\" featuring a lot of cyanotype work which I highly recommend.  Everyone was eager for the group photo, followed by the FPP gear give-away.

We ended up at The Old Town for beer and food, ending our evening.  It was a nice finish to an amazing day.Sunday was the day when Matt, Mike, Leslie and I set up for recording FPP podcast episodes at my house.  We worked from 10 until 8, and I have no idea how many episodes or parts of episodes we did, but I know my brain was fried by the end of the day!  It was a lot of fun, though, and I look forward to hearing Mike's well-crafted edits later on.  One thing I had reinforced by the FPP AAPW -- film shooters are a diverse and fun bunch.  We have an amazing community, and I think the FPP has facilitated and broadened the appeal of using film.  It was no surprise to me that everyone had fun, and I could tell by the conversations going on around me that people really enjoyed the cameraderie  (excuse the pun) that the FPP has created.I thank Mike Raso and Leslie Lazenby for their hard work to make this event happen.

{"title": "Grainy as Knotty Pine", "date": "Wednesday, September 09, 2015", "text": "Back in June, I shot a LOT of film while at Photostock in Harbor Springs.  Usually I am pretty serious about the camera and film combinations, and Photostock often affords me the opportunity to try out some things in a serious way, and to also go off in the other direction--  as in shooting something that will probably completely suck, or be surprisingly amazing.   This time, I used a roll of Kodak Ektachrome 400 that expired in 1999, and was of uncertain provenance.  I shot it in my Lomo La Sardina, which of course, gave me little chance for a good exposure.  Slide film in a simple camera is usually asking for trouble. Expired high-ISO Ektachrome in a La Sardina is just pissing in the wind.With low expectations, I opened the box of developed and mounted slides.  My fears were founded. The images were badly overexposed on film that had lost some latitude to begin with.  In bright sun, the camera is about 1/100th sec at f8.  So, it was already about 5 stops overexposed.  I finally scanned them in last night and opened the images in Paint Shop Pro.  Some post-processing to tame the highlights and bring out the details at least gave me something.  A little fine-tuning and I have some typical Lomo-esque shots -- which is what I guess I was asking for.  The grain is really something, I'll say.

{"title": "Shooting Svema Again", "date": "Sunday, August 30, 2015", "text": "If you have been a follower of the Film Photography Project (FPP), you probably are aware that they are the only seller in the US of \"factory fresh\" Svema film, which is a Ukrainian-based factory.  The FPP has been buying miles of the film, and you can purchase it from them by the roll, or in bulk rolls. Earlier, I tested a bunch of the Svema films, and really have liked the different stocks that I have tried. The redscale was certainly unique.  The Svema FN64 is another \"keeper.\" Most of the Svema films appear to be on a Polyester base (PET?), which in the case of  Svema 100, is whisper-thin, but tough as nails.  You cannot rip it.  This also makes me wonder what the original application of the film was for.  Traffic or military surveillance? In any event, there are no flashed edge markings in the film sprockets, or other identification.  I obtained a bulk roll of 100 feet from the FPP, and because it is definitely thinner than acetate-based films, the roll seems more compact.  The film is easy to load into cassettes, and I suspect that one could easily fit 48 frames in a standard cassette.  However, I try to be in the 30-35 frame range when I load. Developers -- I used the standard recommended developer for this film - D-76 1:1 for 11.5 minutes at 20 deg. C.  The Massive Development chart lists HC110 dilution B for 11 minutes for an ISO of 200.  I have enough to experiment with, so I may try Rodinal for 6 min at 1:25 just to see what I get.  Mike Raso uses D-76 full-strength for 6 minutes.I shot a roll with my Nikkormat EL  and a 45mm 2.8 GN Nikkor (which is quite the \"pancake lens\") last week, and developed the film the same night.  The film went fairly easily into my plastic  Jobo reel, and I processed as described above in D-76.  It takes only a short time for the film to dry.  I would say that it is totally different from traditional emulsions.   One thing to note -- since this film is so thin, make sure that your take-up spool grabs it positively before you start shooting. The film lies very flat in the scanning holders with no cupping or curling, and scans beautifully.  I used my Epson V700 scanner at 2400 dpi, 8 bit-gray scale, and below are some of the images that resulted.  Overall, I like the grain and  the tonality of the film, and as I shoot more with it, I'll have more opportunity to tweak it in the development process."},
{"title": "Sally Mann's Hold Still.", "date": "Sunday, August 23, 2015", "text": "Hold Still, A Memoir with Photographs by Sally Mann has to be one of the most engrossing books by a photographer that I have read. Published this year (2015), it is an intimate autobiography by one of America's celebrated photographers.  Sally Mann not only delves into her own history, but to the history of both parents' families, her life as a child, adolescent, angsty and rebellious teenager, adult, mother, and photographer, and the events that shaped her. She forged a path of her own, and credits photography and the love of her life as two things that saved her from becoming a talented, possibly aimless woman trying to find herself.  Reading this book, I felt as though I were in an extended conversation with her, as events and people and photography are weaved into a compelling and intimate narrative that is so much better than having someone write a biography about a person after his/her death. There is an all-encompassing thread of death in the book, but it's not a put-off.  In the grand circle of things, death is part of life, and our culture in America has put death out there as some sort of aberration, when in fact, it is not.  I think Sally manages to imbue death with a life of its own in this book, and while yes, there is finality in it, life still goes on.  That is just one aspect of this rewarding book.As a photographer, I want to know what motivates people to shoot, and what influenced them in their careers.  A third aspect comes to the fore here as well, and that is her love of the Virginia countryside, especially the mountains, where she grew up. It's the land and the light that moves her. and I get exactly what she's saying.  Yes, she does describe some of her work as a photographer, as well as the fallout about her photography that used her children as subjects.  It's very interesting, and thought-provoking. The fourth aspect of the book that stands out, is the dichotomy and interlacing of black and white cultures in the South. Sally contrasts the beauty of the South, and the ugly truth of apartheid that has permeated the history there.  Sally writes, after finding a nondescript burial in the fields of Mississippi: \"Out in the middle of nowhere, I contemplated this paradoxical scene so emblematic of the plucky, undiminished South, a no-frills monument to the intractability of the overworked soil and the practical, impoverished, generous people who have long tried to wring a living from it.\"   This is a complex book, focusing on her family history, her personal history, finding photography, living as an artist, finding love, finding beauty, and some timeless truths about love, art, redemption, and the continuum of life.  If Sally Mann had never taken a photograph, we would have been poorer for it, but she's equally skilled as a storyteller, and Hold Still will have a hold on you. Hold Still. A Memoir With Photographs by Sally Mann. 2015. Little, Brown and Company. 482 pp. ISBN 978-0-316-24776-4.I should add, after all this, that Sally Mann came to Ann Arbor in 2012 and spoke as part of the Penny W. Stamps School of Art and Design's lecture series.   She was fantastic, and some of the content in Hold Still was part of her lecture. This year, Argus Day was August 15.  It amazes me that I have shot on nearly all of the Argus Days since 2002.  Started in 2001, by a small group of Argus-lovers, Argus Day has endured and remains \"an event.\"  Usually, I use my most trust-worthy Argus - an Argus C-3 or a C-4 that I have shot with previously, and have gotten good results with.  I mean, why would I want to risk lousy results on this one day?  However, this year I tried something different.  My daughter's Argus collection still remains in the house, so I borrowed what appeared to be a working Argus Markfinder, also known as the Argus 21.  The shutter speeds seemed to work, and I figured I could live with the guestimated focusing, as the Markfinder (so named for the cross-hairs in the middle of the viewfinder) does not have a rangefinder like it's offspring, the C-4. One other difference from the C-4 is that the lens on the Markinder is removable to use as an enlarger lens.  Those post-war Argus people though of everything, didn't they?  The cameras have the same shutter mechanism (or at least sound like it!), and overall control placement.  However, I have rarely seen a Markfinder in working condition, so the one pictured here got used for Argus Day.  So did an Argus A I have held onto for some time.  It's an plain-vanilla A, an early version with a single sprocket inside.  The glass was clear, and the shutter speeds and aperture work.  There is no focusing with this model. I met up with Patti Smith and Christy Hoffman at Camera Mall, and Desmond took our photo. Then, Patti was off to shoot at an old-time baseball game.  George Lavoie showed up right after, and he and I walked around Ann Arbor's downtown and did some shooting.  It was a sunny day, so Sunny-16 was easy.  Both cameras were loaded with Arista 100 Ultra, which is Fortepan 100.  One thing I like about the film is the way it lies flat in the scanner's film holders.   Rodinal 1:25 for 6 minutes is a good developer for this film.One of the things I have not liked about the C-4 and now the Markfinder, is that the film winding is likely to pull the film off the spool if it is a reloaded cassette.  There is little feedback from the tension in the film, as one might find with any SLR.  So, I ended up shooting for a fair bit after the roll was fully wound onto the take-up spool. Once I realized this, I waited to open the camera until I got to the darkroom.  The Argus A seemed a bit sloppy in film winding, and whether is is due to the single sprocket or the age of the camera, I could not tell.  Using the camera is pretty simple.  I was amused with George using a nice-looking Argus Matchmatic.  It took him some time to get used to the quirky EV settings on the camera, as well as the very clunky (typical Brick) controls.  These old cameras do force you to think about what you are doing, if you are used to the digital world, and modern controls -- while technologically complex, are easy to use. So, what about the results from the day?  After I developed the film (both rolls in one Jobo tank), it was obvious that the Markfinder had seriously overexposed the film.  All the negatives were dense, so the shutter speed when set at 100, was more like 1/25.  It was especially obvious when a a blurred motorcyclist appeared in one frame, which would have been fine at 1/100 sec.  The negatives from the Argus A were pretty good, but there were spots where the sprockets had been torn.  I know I was advancing the film properly, so I am puzzled about that.   Anyway, with scanning, I was able to adjust the results from the Markfinder  to a certain degree, but there is only so much one can do.There is some vignetting in the Argus A, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  I think Lomography should embrace the Argus A, so that they become more valuable. It certainly fits in with the Lomo aesthetic.  One last Argus A comment -- when I opened the back to remove the film, the pressure plate fell off.  That 75-year old glue just doesn't hold the way it used to.Argus A:Markfinder:"},

The simple lens looks to have about a 40mm focal length. The camera was made in Hong Kong.I was originally going to go ahead and shoot the film that came with the camera, but sanity prevailed.  It's probably C-22 process film, and over 40 years old, so the results would have been predictably abysmal.  I opened the back of the camera (there are two plastic tabs that hold the back on, along with the sticker with the instructions.  I was surprised to see sprocketed 35 mm film.  The supply side was rolled up into a tight coil inside a plastic sleeve.  The take-up spool is also unique, with plastic vanes inside that meet up with the film advance cogs.  Pulling up the film winding wheel releases the take-up spool. This of course, all has to be done in the darkroom, and the loading and unloading is actually fairly easy. The back is easily pried open with a screwdriver. Two tabs hold the back closed, along with the label.I tossed the original film and replaced it with a short length of Arista 100 film.  This allowed me to develop the film last night and scan it this morning.Shooting with the Techni-Pak1It's basically a mini Holga with the square format.  One must press in a small button before advancing the film.  It looks like there are flash contacts on the top of the camera for something like a Diana-F style flash with two posts.

{"title": "A Sure Shot with a Sure Shot 115u", "date": "Saturday, July 25, 2015", "text": "Canon Sure Shot 115uA little history:As we moved into the digital camera explosion, manufacturers still had to cater to the average consumer, and in 2003, a really good digital point and shoot was still quite expensive. Consumers were caught between buying a point and shoot digicam with about 3 megapixels  for around $400, and engaging in the new adventure of digital  prints, etc., or buying a film camera that used technology they were familiar with. Canon introduced  the Sure Shot 115u in 2003, a stylish, compact camera that also looks a lot like some of the digital cameras of that period.   It should be noted that it was expected that the world-wide market for film cameras was diminishing, as it was estimated that 50 MILLION digicams were sold in 2003.    That is a lot of cameras, and yet not all consumers wanted a digital camera, some opting for what they were familiar with.   My 85-ish mother in-law was thrilled last year when I have her a fairly recent high-end Canon P&S to use, as she really missed \"getting prints.\"    In June, my buddy Marc and I stopped at a Goodwill store in Petoskey, MI.  I don't usually expect to find much in the way of cameras these days, but I ended up buying a nice-looking Canon Sure Shot 115u.  At first glance it looked like a digicam, but  for $1.99 I figured it was worth a try to run some film through it.  When the camera was new in 2003, it sold for about $130.  This particular camera looks like new, and like many film P&S cameras, it was probably quickly relegated to the closet as a digicam replaced it soon after it was introduced. Why bother with late-model P&S cameras, anyway?As someone that appreciates classic cameras -- and I have definitely had my share of them over the years, a plastic P&S camera must seem like a silly purchase.  But remember, these later high-end models have pretty much all the features one might desire in a 35mm pocket camera - a zoom from 38mm to 115mm, various shooting modes, excellent optics, and as much technology as one can pack into such a small space.  In addition, a print from one of these cameras, using good technique and low ISO film would have blown away any digicam at that price point. In fact, this Sure Shot can handle 25 - 3200 ISO film.  Don't confuse such a camera with the tons of trashy plastic cameras that were available at the time.  In my mind, however, this camera would be perfect if it had only a 35mm 2.8 lens.  Without the zoom, it would be lighter, faster, and a perfect P&S for snapshots and street photography. The typical f/5.6 aperture is due to the zoom feature.  A wider, faster lens with no zoom would be preferable, in my type of use.I ran a roll of expired Tmax 100 and while I did not use the camera as I normally might have tested a camera, the results are satisfactory.  I'll try a 400 ISO color film in it next to see how it does.  Don't underestimate these cameras, they can produce some good results.   At some point, these newer P&S cameras will become quite \"classic.\"  If you see one for less than $20, pick it up, and use it.  I think you'll be surprised at just how good they are. It's true that the \"best camera\" is the one you have with you, and these compact 35mm and APS point and shoot cameras were easily carried around.  It's a shame that they are not more appreciated than they are.  While the all-metal classics may have all the retro appeal, some of these plastic wonders are possibly better in terms of features and compactness.  However, its obvious that now your phone can probably do a better job, since it's always with you.  In 2003, well, that was not the case."},

The rain held off for the most part, and a constant stream of visitors went through.Rolls of film to be processed.Then, there was  Photostock 2015, which has become a yearly rite of photographic cameraderie (intentionally misspelled) in NW Michigan.  Bill Schwab continues to make the event relevant and attract a growing ban of people that are not only excellent photographers, but darn good people.  My buddy Marc Akemann and I went together, and as is the case on our photo trips, it was a lot of fun and I went through far more film than I thought I would.  I met some very interesting photographers that presented their work at the Birchwood Inn.  Anne Berry and Lori Vrba showed their passion for their work, and it certainly resonated with me.  Photostock is more than a bunch of photographers playing with their gear, talking, and drinking over the fire -- it has always been a source of inspiration where we get to see what other photographers are doing, and what photography means in their lives. It is easy to say \"Photography is my hobby.\" It's often harder to tell others your motivation, what inspires you, and what role it play in your everyday experience.  You can get that at Photostock.   Just a few samples of images from Harbor Springs are below.Fence sceneFoggy MorningTwilight Harbor SpringsOn the way up and back, I continued photographing all of the post offices that I encountered on the back roads that we drove.  Someday, they will be put together in a book, but it really is one of those long-term projects. Back in Ann Arbor, I went to drop off a roll of color film to be processed at CameraMall, and finally succumbed to the lure of the Fuji X100S camera.  It's another tool, of course, but it's pretty damn nice.  I'll do a separate post on it soon. My initial feeling is that Nikon should allow Fuji to design a camera for them.  This one has the look and feel of a film camera, and the results are wonderful.A new tool, the Fuji X100SThe next week found Adrienne and I traveling to Luther, MI for the annual Michigan Entomological Society meeting at Rockwell Lake Lodge, which is owned by Hillsdale College.  It was a great time to see colleagues and friends, and I was presented with a Honorary Lifetime membership for my 30+ years of service to the Society.  I really had no idea that would happen, and I was pretty much speechless when it happened.  I have never been so surprised!So, here it is July 5th, and in another day we are travelling to Marquette for a few days, and I'll report on that trip after we return.   Here are a few shots from the X100S.Baldwin POLudington State Parkback stairs, Ludington."},

Film and alternate processes dominate the scene, but there is no snobbery -- just a bunch of folks with different gear, interests, and methodology.  It's a great way to meet other photographers, learn something new, and basically, have a great time shooting film and laughing with others.  It's fun to reconnect with people I only see there each time, and to make new friends. Each time I go, one of my biggest decisions is figuring out what cameras I will bring.  One year it was the Pentax 6x7 and a few other 35mm, plus Holgas, etc.  Another time it was Nikons and the Hasselblad, etc.  Well, the Pentax 6x7 is gone as is the Hassy system I had.  This year, I'll bring my beautiful Mamiya C330 Professional, the Leica M2, Minolta X700 and XG-M (a new buy), and a couple of plastic cameras.  I haven't yet decided if I'll bring something like my Nikon 1J1.

Many of the people in the audience were college students, and it was interesting seeing the contrast of Mary Ellen, steeped in the tradition of using film, and these young beginners, who grew up in the digital age.  One young woman asked why she didn't get people to smile in her photos.  Mary Ellen gave a great response to what some might regard as an inane question.  She took the time to talk about how making someone smile removes the authenticity of the moment, much less a  a forced appearance.  I thought about that for quite a while, and I have had others ask why I don't smile for a \"selfie.\"  What the hell am I smiling about?    No, Mary Ellen was right -- a grin should be a natural moment, not a fiction.    She answered a lot of questions and I admired her gentle yet firm demeanor.She also told us that she felt very lucky to be able to do her photography at a time when the printed page was THE THING.  Many of us have probably seen some of her documentary work without realizing that she was the photographer.  She was an accomplished photographer, and that is still an understatement. With Mary Ellen Mark, It was not not about the personality, the camera, or the gallery.  It was about telling an honest story with her camera.  She was able to become part of the surroundings, and yet not seeming to affect the subjects.  That's a hell of a talent -- and to come away with images that move us as well.  I am glad that I had the chance to see her in 2013.  Rest in peace, Mary Ellen.  Your photographs will speak for you - always."},

{"title": "Postcards From Abroad", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2015", "text": "Back in March, I was contacted by a young woman on our Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club facebook page. She was getting into using film cameras, and wasn't sure if her exposures were as they were supposed to be.  Ariel had some questions about her Yashica Electro GN that she had recently purchased at a local resale shop.  She had shot a couple of rolls of color film with it and needed some assurance that it was working properly, and some photography tips.  It turns out that she was planning a hike across Spain and wanted to be independent of the digital world, shooting film to document her trip.  We met up at a local coffee shop and chatted for over an hour, discussing film photography, accessories, technique, and so forth.  It was clear to me that she had been reading up on her camera and film shooting, and it was a fun chat, as I had brought her some goodies to use.  It's easy to forget how exciting it was when someone gave me something as simple as a mini-tripod, some filters, and a cable release.  Some of us \"old-timers\" have lots of stuff sitting around that we aren't using, and I have always made a point to share and mentor when I can.  I have benefited a great deal from the generosity of others, and passing things along continues the good karma.After I left the coffee shop I thought about Ariel's trip and it occurred to me that what she needed was a small, reliable 35mm camera that was pocketable.  Alas!  The Olympus Stylus Epic was the answer. I had one with the IR remote that would be perfect for such a trip.  I emailed her and we met again before she left for her adventure.  I showed her the basic camera functions, and told her the camera was perfect for that mini-tripod, as she could take self-portraits using the IR remote.  She was reassured by the camera's reliability and would be a good backup to the Yashica.a postcard of Casa de Conches in Salamanca, Spain.Yesterday, I received a post card from Salamanca, Spain.  I was at first puzzled and then realized as I turned it over to read it, that it was from Ariel.  She is doing well and using the Olympus Stylus camera every day.

{"title": "KW's Praktina FX", "date": "Sunday, May 10, 2015", "text": "About a month ago, I encountered a Praktina FX while at work.  It was being discarded, as it was time to clean out some storerooms.  K.W. is short for Kamera-Werkstatten, which became part of the VEB Pentacon group in 1964.  KW is better known for the Praktica line of cameras, which were produced to about 1990.  The Praktina, while an SLR, also has a separate optical finder.  Like other cameras of its type in the early 1950s, it does not have an auto-return mirror.  Since the camera is able to use a bulk magazine (450 exposures!) and motor drive, I think that might have made the extra finder useful in such instances.  The Praktina FX was manufactured from 1953-1958.  Unlike the Praktica series, it does not have an M42-type lens mount, but instead has a breech-lock mount, similar to the Canon manual focus cameras of the 1960s-70s.  It was also the first SLR to have a motor drive!Using this camera was fairly natural, and the only oddity is the lack of a wind-lever.  The lens stops down automatically when the exposure is made.  This model came with a Carl Zeiss Jena Biotar 58mm f/2 lens.  That design was copied in the Helios 44-2 lens used on many Soviet cameras. I shot a roll of Arista.edu 100 ultra (Fomapan 100), developed in D-76.  Overall, the images were pretty good, though I should test the camera again with a color film.  There is a very faint haze inside the lens.Here are a few images shot around town."},
{"title": "It's a Miranda!", "date": "Wednesday, April 15, 2015", "text": "A few weeks ago I purchased a really nice example of a Miranda Sensorex II SLR at the Kiwanis sale. At $25, how could I not do so?  Miranda has always been an outlier in my world of 35mm SLR cameras, and I have only seen a few in the flesh, but never have I shot with one until now.  The Sensorex II appeared in 1972, when I was 15.  I certainly would have gone onto becoming a star photographer, if I had that camera then (ha!).  It wasn't until a year later that I received an Exa IIa SLR, which of course, was primitive by comparison. I blame my lack of photographic ascendancy to that turn of events.Once I got my new to me Miranda home, I checked it out more closely.  Besides the bayonet mount, the camera also has a 44mm thread for the early Miranda lenses.  The shutter button is on the front of the camera, and shutter speeds go from the usual B, and 1-1/1000 sec.  I won't go into the unusual   aperture coupling methodology, but it works.  The power for the meter was supposed to be a mercury cell, but I used a hearing aid (Zinc-air) battery, and the meter is spot on. Everything about the camera was clean and operational.  The next day i took it for a stroll to the N side of town.  Every frame of the roll of expired Fuji Provia 100 came out quite good.   You can find out more about these cameras here. In use, it took a little while to get used to the placement of the front-mounted shutter button, but once I did, using the camera was a breeze.  It handles very well, and the match needle and circle on a stick to gauge the exposure works nicely.  The all-metal body seems fairly robust, too.Here are some examples from the camera on Provia 100 and on Arista 100 ultra b&w film.  I'll have to look for a few more lenses to turn it into a nice kit."},
{"title": "Some Cameras Don't Age Well", "date": "Thursday, April 02, 2015", "text": "The beauty of film cameras is that there are thousands of models that have been made over the years.  If one were limited to 35mm SLRs, well, there are still many hundreds of models, and it's likely that a 50 year old SLR may work just fine, even if the meter does not.  Pop in a roll of film, and you can get high-resolution images without much effort.Now, forward (or backward, if you prefer)  to 1999. Kodak introduced the DCS 315 Professional SLR. Based on a Nikon Pronea 6i APS body with Kodak digital guts, the camera shot 1.5 megapixel images on a sensor that was a 2.6 crop factor (similar in size to the Nikon 1 sensor!).  Why am I bringing up this camera? Well, we have an area at work where we are accumulating digital detritus to be taken away.  Today, I saw the DCS 315 with some accessories and manuals, so i thought I would give it a try and photograph it before it gets sent away. I plugged in an AC adapter because the battery tray was missing.  It originally took 6 1.5 v AA batteries.  Sure enough, it powered up.  I attached a Tamron 28-80 AF lens, and shot a few images with it.  The images are stored on a full-sized PCMCIA card of 160 MB.  The other outlet is a firewire port.  Well, none of my computers have firewire, so that was out. My Dell Inspiron laptop runs Ubuntu Linux 14, and has a PCMCIA slot, so I inserted the card (many times the size of a CF card, by the way), and....nada.   So, I could not get any images off the camera.    End of experiment.As I said, some cameras do not age well.  Just about any digital camera at the dawn of the digital photography explosion is pretty much useless now.  1.5 MP's are nothing to write home about, even then, but because it was DIGITAL, it was cool.  Guess what, it would have been better to shoot slides and scan them in than the images  those cameras produced.  I remember shooting with an Apple Quicktake 200, and regret using the damn thing now, as the 640x480 images are worthless.  Yes, things have progressed, and today, any current DSLR or high-end mirrorless camera will produce bigger images than most of us will ever have a use for.  I suspect the turning point on SLR sales was when 6 MP cameras became the entry-level for the consumers.  You can make a damn nice 8x12 prints from 6 MP (which I have done many times with my D70s, which I still have).  The DCS 315 didn't age well, and was surpassed by better cameras in a short time.  Like some of the other film/digital hybrids, it was too early, too clunky, and expensive.  Early adopters get screwed, don't they?Meanwhile, the Nikon Pronea 6i used APS film, which of course, had its own set of problems, but good photos from the film was not a problem.  That was a pretty nice body for an APS SLR.  So, there was no feeling of loss as I put the DCS 315 back into the box of junk.  It served its purpose 16 years ago. Now, if that had been a Nikon F5...!The PCMCIA card is huge, and it's next to an old CF card of only 16 MB!"},

I had a great chat with Desmond, and he was busily getting the store stocked and ready for business.  Today, I went back down, and I wasn't the only other person in the store, and the stock was being shelved as quickly as they could do it.  You can bet I had a case of lens lust, seeing so many lovely new lenses in the glass case.  I bought some packs of film (and yes, they will be carrying Impossible Project film), and chatted for a while.  It's obvious that Desmond knows his stuff, and the location is great - close to campus, close to the heart of downtown, and parking is nearby.  I can only hope that folks go and buy their stuff their and support Camera Mall's effort!Camera Mall is located at 518 East Washington Street, Ann Arbor.  You can reach the store at  734-997-5031.  Desmond indicated that the stock is still coming in, and I suspect that by the end of April everything will be in place.  However, you can certainly buy lenses, bodies, film, used film cameras, digital cameras, etc. right now.  I think the store will also be operating a photo lab.To Desmond and the other Camera Mall folks (out of Muskegon, MI) -- Welcome to Ann Arbor, and thanks for taking a chance on us!"},

I also picked up some other items very cheaply.  A cheap Argus 35mm outfit for $1 and the original K-mart sticker on the back listed it for $24.99!    A neck strap for $2, some 1 GB CF memory cards, and a Bogen quick-release plate for $2.  Over a decade ago, my daughter and I would occasionally visit the sale, and like any operation of this type, it changed from week to week.  I know I got some bargains back then, and with many people abandoning their film cameras or seeing little value in them, they end up in places like Kiwanis.  Today's visit at least made me more aware of what they have -- and depending on what one is looking for -- there is something for everyone.  Light meters, expired film, plastic cameras, vintage Kodaks, modern and vintage SLRs, lenses, lots of flashes, books, etc.  It's certainly worth stopping in from time to time to check it out.Lots of stuff to look over. Because the Kiwanis folks have volunteers that look over the items, you are more likely to find that things actually work.  It's a good place to browse, but since it is only open on Saturday mornings, it can be quite packed and busy, too.The Miranda Sensorex II I purchased is in great shape. I put in a battery and turned on the meter, and it sprang to life.  It all looks very clean, so I am going to shoot a roll of b&w this weekend, to see how it works.Later on, we stopped at the Ann Arbor Recycle/Reuse center, which is open every day, and things can come and go very quickly. Tom Nighswander, local photographer and Kiwanis volunteer I have purchased many books there over the years, as well as some camera gear.  It's all very spotty though, and things don't sit around too long unless they are really awful.  All I saw there was a Dacora-Matic 4D camera from 1960.  Dusty and probably with a non-working Selenium meter, I left it on the counter.  It was interesting to see, though.  An instance where the push-button craze just went too far!The fun thing about thrift stores is the hunt -- and finding something that you think is a bargain, versus the wait and see atmosphere on ebay.  Browsing is serendipitous, which can also lead to some very interesting finds.We all have stories about great thrift store finds.  What's yours?in the glass caseThe Miranda Sensorex II is a beauty.Dacora-Matic 4D.  An odd one."},
{"title": "A Look at the Konica TC-X ", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2015", "text": "Sometime last fall, I found a nice example of the  Konica TC-X SLR, which appeared in 1983.  It has been termed the first \"all plastic-bodied SLR\" and was manufactured by Cosina for Konica.  The one I purchased came with a gaudy Konica strap, which certainly is attention-getting!  The TC-X is typical of Konica's autoreflex line of cameras in that it features shutter priority operation, and much like the Autorflex TC it replaced, the shutter speeds range from 1/8 to 1/1000 sec., + B.  While the camera does offer DX-code reading to set the ISO, it can also be manually set for a range of 50 to 1600.  The on-off switch on the top deck next to the film winding lever is easy to use, and the shutter button has a threaded recess for a cable release.  There is a self-timer switch on the front of the camera.   That's pretty much it for features.  Oh, and it has a very plastic body.  I suspect it has a pentamirror rather than a pentaprism, as the image through the viewfinder is nowhere near as nice as that found on an Autoreflex T.   However, it does have a split image circle at the center microprism, which does aid in focus. So far, I have only shot a roll of expired Tmax-100 which I recently developed.  The exposures look good, and with the 40mm 1.8 lens as pictured, the combo makes for a very light, fairly compact SLR.  The body uses 1 AAA battery for the metering and auto-exposure.  If power fails, you can still use the camera manually by setting the aperture and shutter speeds independently.Like all the Konicas that I have used, the shutter-priority operation is an acquired taste.  I prefer aperture-priority, but it's not a big deal making the adjustment.  The Konica glass is very good, and the body very cheap.  I see no reason why this would not make a pretty good camera for street photography.  It takes up little space, and ought to give good results. All of the images that follow were taken during the A3C3 photo meetup in Clinton, MI last November."},
{"title": "Fun Packed Like Sardines", "date": "Sunday, March 08, 2015", "text": "Last week one of our A3C3 members brought an upscale Lomography camera to the meeting.  It was the brass-bodied La Sardina camera with the matching side-mounted flash.  I was enchanted with the fact that it has a 22mm wide-angle lens, and certainly is a toy camera, based on its feature set.  The next day, I went trolling online and snagged a La Sardina \"Marathon\" model that cost me $21 when I added in my Amazon rewards.  Not a bad deal, really.  While the Marathon La Sardina is all-plastic and not brass, it works the same.  If I am going to buy a toy camera, it better cost me less than $50.One thing that has always impressed me with Lomography is their packaging. True to form, the package was a delight, and most of it was easily recyclable. The box contained the camera, lens cap, instruction sheet, and a nice little colorfully-illustrated book that espouses the Lomography philosophy, and has hints for using the camera.    I am not going to do a full review on the feature set, as there are other reviews out there.  Basically though, it is a 35mm camera with a fixed shutter speed of 1/100 sec (and Bulb) and a fixed aperture of f/8.  It can focus in two zones - close-up - 2-4 feet, and far - 6 feet to infinity.  The 22mm lens gives a reasonably wide-angle of view.  The camera is able to do multiple exposures on the MX setting.  It has bottom and side-mounted tripod sockets, and a film counter.  When rewinding the film, you just twist the rewind knob, as there is no extra release to press.  The lens collapses into the body for transport, and telescope back out for use with a twist.  A printed reminder on the top of the lens barrel tells you when you can shoot with it.  A cable-release socket is built into the shutter button.Use of the camera.  Really, it's pretty simple to use -- and that is part of the fun.  I put in a roll of Arista.edu 100 black and white film and shot a roll in one morning while at work.  Indoors, I used the camera in B mode and timed the exposures at less than a second to 2 seconds. For most of those I used a tripod.  The viewfinder is fairly accurate.  The cable-release was very handy indoors.  The shutter is very quiet, as well.Results. For a first roll -- pretty good.  I developed the Arista.edu 100 in Rodinal at 1:25 dilution.  All the shots came out pretty good, and my seat of the pants timing ain't bad.  Yes, there is a lot of fun packed into that sardine can!"},
{"title": "Tripods and Quick-Release Plates Will Make Life Easier", "date": "Monday, March 02, 2015", "text": "I recently posted this image, and it generated some interesting comments.  First and foremost -- what I did mean by it?What I meant was that no matter how much you spend on a camera system, if you don't also have a decent tripod, you are not going to have the results that the optics and camera body are capable of.  Now, that may seem obvious to many of you, and yet, I see that some people think that because their camera has built-in stabilization they don't need a tripod.   Here are 4 reasons why a tripod is important:1. A stable platform2. Repeatable  exposures3. Better subject framing4. Hands-off exposuresA stable platform  is perhaps the most important.  While I am capable of hand-holding some cameras at 1/15 sec, it's not going to fly with a telephoto, long exposure times, and low ISOs.   By tripod, I don't mean that you need to lug a 6 pound aluminum tripod everywhere.  Depending on the size of your camera and the conditions, there are all sorts of mini-tripods, clamps, etc. that provide stability.   Find one or two that give you the most flexibility of shooting.  Often, a mini-tripod with a small P&S will be very much appreciated when you want yourself in the photo, or for long exposures.Repeatability.  A tripod allows you to bracket your exposures, try different filters, etc., without moving your camera from its position.  Pretty darn important.Better framing.  A tripod slows you down a bit and allows you to try different angles, positions, lenses, etc. to better gauge the effectiveness of your vision.  Sure, it's not going to work for street photography, but it really helps in most other situations.  In the studio, it allows you to go back and forth between the camera and subject (human or still-life) and make scene adjustments without changing the camera position.Hands-off.  How else can you do really good selfies?   Really, though, being able to use a remote release of some sort is very liberating and sometimes essential for some photographs.  Second, for long exposures or macro work, or telephoto, you may want to use a remote release to avoid camera motion. All the above reasons are pretty self-evident, but they bear repeating.  My second comment is that while even a crappy tripod may be better than no tripod at all, there is a good reason to use a good tripod and quick-release mounting system. You will simply use it more.  I have had to use tripods with limited movements, non-secure leg positions, etc., and they are not worth the trouble.  They can be frustrating as hell.  So, do not waste your money on a cheap, poorly built model.  You don't need to spend $300, either.Two RC2 plates in the front, and the hex plate in the back.hex Manfrotto plate and holderA quick-release system makes tripod use much more efficient.  You simply attach a quick-release plate to the base of your camera(s) and set them in place in the tripod's matching mount. Some of them click into place, and others use a small knob to tighten them into place.  I favor the ones made by Bogen/Manfrotto as pictured here.  The RC2 plates are what I use for most of my 35mm and medium-format cameras, and the larger hexagonal mount I use for my Pentax 6x7 and 4x5 cameras with which I also use a heavier-duty tripod.  There are other plate designs made by other manufacturers - but the RC2 system is pretty widespread.I have over a dozen of the RC2 quick-release plates that are on my various cameras, and I never have to worry about if a camera does not have one.  I also keep a spare loose one in the car just in case.  A quick search on ebay will bring up many clones of the RC2 plates for as little as $4 each.  The current RC2 plate sold by Manfrotto are polymer-resin and not metal.  They weigh less, but I don't have any experience with them.My choice for a tripod head is a good medium-weight ball head, and second choice would be a 3-D head or 3-way adjustable head. Ball head with RC2 plate holderI do not recommend 2-way only heads, as they limit the adjustment of your camera.    Of course, this is for still photography only.  I do not shoot video, which has its own unique array of heads.RC2 plate on the cameraAs far as picking out a good tripod -- it's best to try one out before you buy.  Of course, I have long been a Bogen/Manfrotto user.  I also have a Hakuba carbon-fiber tripod that I recently bought used.  I like it a lot, and it is only a bit lighter than my Manfrotto tripod.    Make sure that your tripod has individually adjustable legs that can angle out from the center column independent of the others.  It should have positive-locking segments that are easy to tighten and loosen, and be sturdy enough for your camera(s).  It should also be able to bring your camera to your eye-level, unless of course, it is a mini-tripod!  There are many very good tripods available, but do try one out before you purchase it.  Some tripods have foam-covered upper leg segments so that they are easier to carry and handle in cold weather.  You can make your own from polyfoam pipe insulation and duct tape.I hope that this helps."},
{"title": "Holga 35 Fisheye", "date": "Thursday, February 26, 2015", "text": "Recently, the Lomography store had a sale on some things, so I decided to pick up the slip-on fisheye lens and fisheye viewfinder for the Holga 35.  I have had the Holga 35bc (bent corners)  camera for several years, and it's a fun, simple toy camera that uses 35mm film.  Like its big brother (or big sister), it has very minimal controls - sunny or cloudy, bulb or instant, the four focus zones, and a hotshoe.  In general, 400 ISO film works for most conditions with this camera. The lens and viewfinder come in little attractive boxes, well-packaged. That's always been a hallmark of Lomography -- they pay attention to package design.  No plain cardboard boxes for them!  The instructions inside are easy to follow, and the lens comes with front and rear protective caps. The lens and viewfinder fit exactly as they are supposed to, as well.Looking through the viewfinder gives you a circular fisheye view, which does not actually match what the camera is getting.  It's good for framing, and certainly better than the regular viewfinder.Since the fisheye is such wide-angle, I wonder if the actual focus position makes any difference.  Nonetheless, I set the lens to infinity while shooting with it.The Holga 35 is a great cold-weather camera in that there are literally no controls to fiddle with, so for mittened hands, it is great.I finished up a roll of 400 ISO Kodak (somewhat expired) color film and sent the film to Blue Moon Camera and Machine, where they do a wonderful job with processing. I'll post two images here to give you an idea of the fisheye effect from this lens.  It's not a circular fisheye such as the one you get with the Diana version. The negatives are cropped at the top and bottom,   The effect is pretty good, though,  and perhaps the cropped image looks better than the circular fisheye."},
{"title": "Back to Basics - The Ricoh KR-5 Super II", "date": "Wednesday, February 04, 2015", "text": "Back in December, I discussed several 35mm SLRs made by Ricoh in the 1970s and 1980s.  The Ricoh XR-7 is certainly a very good K-mount body,  with excellent features to enable a photographer to do just about anything. More recently, I acquired another Ricoh SLR for $5.99 + 7.00 shipping. So, for the price of a pizza, I purchased another camera. The KR-5 Super II sounds pretty advanced, doesn't it?  If the KR-5 was good, and the KR-5 Super was better, then the Super II must be awesome!  Well, hold on, there.  This is not a better camera than the XR-7.  Technologically, it looks like a lot of the cameras that were pushed out of the factory that were made by Chinon.  The camera has about the same amount of plastic as the Vivitar SLRs, the Nikon FM10, etc., that were made in the mid 1990s.  The KR-5 Super II is lighter for sure than the KR-5.  The shutter speeds go from B to 1/2000 sec.  it has X-sync in the flash shoe, and it has a self-timer.  Pretty standard, bare-bones features for an SLR.  Red/green LEDs in the viewfinder indicate the \"proper exposure\" and the ISO/ASA dial is adjustable from 25 to 1600.  This is a manual camera, so there is no compensation dial.  So, yes, it is a basic camera that will do anything one might ask of a Pentax K1000.  The manual can be found online at the usual site of Butkus.org.A 35-70mm f/3.5 lens, carrying bag, cleaning kit, and manual came with the body that I purchased.  I have not yet had time to shoot a roll of film through it.  It definitely has more of a plastic lightweight feel to it, and I will update this page after I shoot a roll of film.  Ricoh sold a bunch of these, and they are plentiful online.  So, I imagine that if one is searching for a bare-bones K-mount SLR, this one should do the job, and with all the K-mount lenses available, you should be able to assemble a pretty decent kit for less than a good dinner. There nothing wrong with going back to the basics, either.UPDATE (03-09-2015)I finally shot up a roll of Arista.edu 100 b&w (=Fortepan 100) with the KR5 Super II.  Everything worked great, and I shot these with the Zenitar 50mm f/2."},
{"title": "Catching Up With My Past", "date": "Saturday, January 31, 2015", "text": "Gray treefrog, Nikkormat FT2, 2001When I first got really, really serious about photography in 2000, I wanted to become more proficient at macro photography to be able to take photographs of insects and flowers, as well as other scenes from nature that appealed to me.  I had been using cameras since I was in high school, and while I learned a few things over the years, I never really delved into the mechanics, aesthetics, and possibilities of photography.  My first year, from 2000-2001, I immersed myself in reading all I could about nature  and macro photography, and nobody wrote better books about it than John Shaw.  His books and videos inspired me a great deal, and like many beginners, I also fell into the trap of trying to emulate what he was doing.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, especially when it comes to doing macro work.  You must learn the techniques for best results.  However, in the days of shooting slide film, I shot a LOT of slides to get sort of where I needed to be.  I am glad that I did, though, because those slides are reminders that before the age of digital dominance, I could get quite a few good shots on a roll of 36 exposures of whatever slide film I was using.  They were not ALL good, however.  Lots of learning went into those, and I am glad that at that time, getting a roll processed was pretty cheap.   Tent caterpillars, Nikon FE, 2002So, the title of this post comes from me literally catching up with my past accumulation of 35mm slides.  Boxes and boxes of them.  laying them out on the light table and pitching the awful ones, the ones that have no real use, and keeping the good exposures, the ones that show a clear idea of subject, and of course, the ones that have photos of people and places.  Things that change over time, are frozen in time when you photograph them.  I am not the man now that I was in 1986 or 2001.  Some of the slides featured shots of volunteers that worked with my wife, and the ones she photographed in 1991 are all dead now.   Some of the slides are from the 1980s, when I was active in model rocketry.  Most of those will get pitched except for the ones with people I knew, and the ones that were shot at places where we did launches for the public.So, yes, I am catching up to my past by going through these slides -- some of them I have not looked at in 10 years or more.  When I am done, they will all be properly labeled as much as needed, and stored in archival slide pages in 3-ring binders or hanging files.  Want to see what's there?  Hold it up to the light.Prickly ash, 2002.

{"title": "More K-Mount Madness - The Pentax ZX-M", "date": "Saturday, January 17, 2015", "text": "The other day, another package appeared with a K-mount camera, but this time it was actually a Pentax.  A ZX-M, to be precise, with a 50mm f/2 Pentax KA lens.  It was a Goodwill auction item, for $11.03 and with shipping, cost me about $25, which is less than what the lens goes for, which is why I bought it in the first place.   I have had other iterations of the plastic-bodied Pentax SLRS, but not this model.  I previously reviewed the Pentax ZX-5, which is an AF version, whereas the ZX-M is totally manual focus, but does have Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture-Priority and Manual modes. It must be the lightest SLR I have picked up thus far.  Unlike the comparable Nikon N65, the ZX-M meters with non-AF lenses, and should be thought of as a replacement for the venerable Pentax K1000.   It has exposure compensation settings of +/- 3 in half -stop increments, and an ISO range of 6 to 6400 if you set it manually.  There is an exposure lock button that lasts for 10 seconds after you push it.  Shutter speeds of B, and 2 sec to 1/2000 sec, and in aperture-priority mode you can get times exposures as long as 30 seconds.  The electronic shutter is stepless in A mode, so, shoot away!  The camera has single shot mode, continuous (2 fps) and self-timer.  There is also a depth of field preview button... something that is often missing on inexpensive cameras.The camera is incredibly light, and with the 50mm lens, batteries (2 CR-2) and a roll of film, weighs just a bit over a pound. The penta-mirror keeps the weight down, and the relatively low-profile of the camera makes it easy to tuck into a bag.  I have a roll of the FPP 200 b&w film in it now, and will post my results later. While many people give the advice to start with a 35mm SLR camera like the Pentax K1000,  Canon AE-1, or Nikon FM, there is no reason not to use a camera like the ZX-M.  The features are more advanced than the K1000, which is now getting on in years, and it's also a fraction of the price.   It's certainly cheaper than a 4-pack of Fuji Superia film at Walgreens.  It uses every K-mount lens, and can certainly be used to take wonderful photographs."},
{"title": "Noteworthy News  Regarding  Street Photography", "date": "Monday, January 12, 2015", "text": "Union Station, Chicago, 2012.Usually, my blog posts are all about me.  Today, I'd like to share a couple links to some other sites and both of them happen to involve street photography. From Toronto -- the Stephen Bulger Gallery has acquired the Vivian Maier negatives from the Jeffrey Goldstein collection.  This effectively protects them from the clutches of anyone in the Cook Co. IL government that had silly ideas of claiming copyright on them, and also facilitates their protection and continued showing via a legitimate gallery.  The interview on CBC radio is excellent, and it is quite interesting to hear from a gallery owner.  I have hope that the legal challenges will be tossed out or resolved soon so that we can all see more of Maier's work. The Lomo LCA 120 camera is making the news. The Phloblographer has a review of it.  I like what I see so far, except for the price.  However, consider this -- the 38mm on 6x6 equals about 21mm in 35mm format.  The only 6x6 medium format camera with a 38mm lens is the Hasselblad SuperWide, a camera which I have actually used.  The Lomo LCA 120 is a pocket camera, has a glass lens, auto-exposure, and zone focus.  The Hasselblad SWC will set you back over $1500 for a used model, and it has nothing auto about it and does not fit into a pocket.  As street photography goes, I see the Lomo LCA 120 as a winner, and I sure wish I could get one to test out.  I was not enamored with my Lomo Belair, and frankly, was very disappointed with it.  The Lomo LCA 120 is a different beast.Lomography's LCA 120 (image from lomography.com)Based upon the images I have seen and some other online comments, I believe Lomography has found a niche with this camera.  Anyone that loves shooting 120 film for street photography ought to rejoice.  It's not supposed to be a crappy  toy camera, and it fits in a pocket. It shoots very wide.  It has auto-exposure.  What's not to like? Just the price.  HOWEVER... it's actually in line, given the paucity of new film cameras. The third thing I want to mention is that I found out last night that Camera Shopper is still being published.  For years, I picked up copies at camera shows in the Detroit area.  For those of you that have never seen an issue, Camera Shopper was a small publication that catered to collectors and always featured fun articles on classic and collectible cameras and accessories.  The buy/sell/trade ads were there, of course, but I really enjoyed the articles.  Then, with most of the shows gone, I had assumed that the magazine went under, a casualty of ebay and the web.  Not so!  It is still being published and a yearly online-only subscription is only $15/10 issues.  A bargain....and the last thing... A wonderful overview on the history of the Eastman Kodak Brownie, and how it democratized photography is up on the BBC website.  Check it out!  I have owned a number of Brownies at any given time, and although the name kept being applied to more than cardboard box cameras, simplicity and utility was the hallmark of the cameras that bore the Brownie label.  I think they reached their apex with the Brownie Hawkeye Flash, a wonderful Bakelite-bodied camera from the fifties.

{"title": "My Fantasy Camera Store", "date": "Saturday, January 03, 2015", "text": "Over the years, as the local camera  stores dwindled down to one, and then none (see my previous post), I and my photography friends would amuse ourselves with what we would do if we won the lotto and wanted to open a camera store, etc.   Obviously, it would require something like that, because nobody expects to make any money at it.  However, here are some main points to consider:1. It should be a gathering place for people in the arts, and especially photographic arts.2. Film and alt-process materials would be available.3. C-41 Film lab with scanning services for 35mm and 120.4. Used equipment for sale.5. Coffee shop and gallery space included.6. Darkroom/studio space.some cleaning needed...That's the short list, of course.  It doesn't have all the details in how the place would be operated.  It would have to find a niche and be a place that adds value to its customer base.  For one, such a place would offer a series of workshops from basic photography to specific techniques and methodology.A library of sorts is a useful thing to have.  Especially when sipping a coffee.   The gallery space would rotate on a 60-day basis.   A coffee shop/photo store isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. Bookstores have been doing it for years.Exhibit openings are a great place to be. Film is and will forever be a niche market.  Leave the digital thingamajigery to the online world.  We have great online resources, too for film, and one of those is well-known -- Free Style in California.  Another is the Film Photography Project store --  the other place to go for film, and in my opinion, a very cool place for film lovers.  However, if you want to  serve the local community, my fantasy store would be something like Leslie Lazenby's store in Findlay, OH.    Her store, Imagine That! serves the local college students in their photography class needs, and while requiring some extra work in assembling student kits, provides a real service and value for them.  It can be done in the Ann Arbor area, too, with WCC, EMU, UM, and various high schools.  Guess what?  There IS a demand to have film-based classes, and such a store could more readily enable that. Cameras and coffee!The darkroom and studio space could be rented, of course.   Studio space is especially necessary, as it frees people to try some projects and be creative without having to actually have to own a space and all the lighting that is necessary.Beginner SLRUsed equipment would of course, be fairly priced somewhere in line between ebay and KEH prices.  Sometimes a $5 camera is just a $5 camera.  I suppose consignment sales would be an option, too. It's pretty tough for beginners to buy a film camera without some guidance.  There is no reason that a Nikon N65 and similar cheap Canon EOS cameras can't be used by beginners. Put them in Manual mode, and you are good.  The idea that they should use a Pentax K1000 is a myth.  Have them use a camera that is similar to the DSLRs that are out there.  Of course, having older cameras is also a good thing, but they are not always the best choice for a beginner.Partnering with LOMO not a bad idea.This fantasy store obviously can't be in a town with high rents like Ann Arbor. It would have to be in a place where the rent is cheaper and lots of unused downtown spaces.  Since this IS a fantasy store bought with Lotto winnings, I guess owning the building is a better choice.  Adrian, MI would be one such place, but closer to Ann Arbor would be better. Ypsilanti, perhaps.  It would have to be run by people that love photography, and are willing to do the outreach and build the customer base.  So, yes, it would require one to win the lottery to be able to finance this imaginary store.  Or else, it could be a co-operative venture, but that still takes money.Anyhow, that's the bare bones of my fantasy photo store.  It's always fun to dream.  It takes hard work to make dreams a reality, and sometimes a bit of luck, too.What would your fantasy store look like?"},
{"title": "The Last One Standing...Closes. Huron Camera, RIP Dec. 2014", "date": "Wednesday, December 31, 2014", "text": "Huron Camera, Dec. 29, 2014.Huron Camera is no more.  The last brick and mortar camera store in Washtenaw County, Michigan,  closed its doors for good on Tuesday, Dec. 30.  For those of us that freqented the store, it's like losing an old friend.  An old friend that has been on life support and slips away, quietly, into the night.  The store's spot right on Main Street for the past 40+ years was an invitation to come and browse.  I know that I first visited the store around 2000.  During the 1990s and into 2002, Huron Camera also had satellite stores in Saline, Battle Creek, and Jackson, MI.  I also saw their extensive sales tables at area camera swaps into 2003 or so.  The store had a good reputation for camera repairs, and of course, the one thing most people noticed was the large stock of used cameras and accessories in the glass cases.  Prior to the deluge of digital, Huron Camera was the place to go for many things.  At one time, the Ann Arbor area had at least  7 stores that catered to photographers.  Around 2004, there were but 4.   I have previously written the obituary for Big George's, which closed its doors in 2008.  Ritz Camera closed in 2008, Adray Camera in 2006, and Dave's Photo Emporium (formerly Studio Center Photographic) closed in 2005.   All of the above stores had different reasons for closing,  and Big George's was especially a huge loss to the local photographic community.  That left only Huron Camera as the sole place to locally buy photographic supplies.  Therefore, we film users went to Huron Camera.  It was a 20 minute drive from my house if I took the expressway.  Okay, note that I said \"film users.\" The digital onslaught was in full force by 2007.  Not just the impact of digital cameras, but the online retailers were eating the business from the brick and mortar stores.  Now, if you are purely shopping based on price, you are most likely to buy a new camera or lens online because yes, it is generally cheaper.  The selection is also likely to be better.  However, nobody at Amazon or B&H will be there to answer a question for you on your new camera... or your old one, for that matter.  There lies part of the value of brick and mortar stores.  Not big chains like Best Buy, either.  Locally-owned stores that have staff that can answer a question.  Smaller independent stores do not have the purchase power of the big chains from the warehouses, can't share as well in manufacturer sales promotions, and can't stock new items in quantity or have every model available.  It's just impossible from a business  perspective, especially in a small town.  The old \"we can order it for you\" may work for some, and it did, but for the younger, more internet-savvy, it is well, \"I can order it myself.\"  So, like  the aperture on a lens, the opportunities for stores like Huron Camera went from f/1.4 to f/8 in the span of a few years.  What else happened in 2008?  The largest economic crash since the depression.   So, the downturn really hurt the smaller stores harder. I will leave the autopsy of Huron Camera for someone else to analyze.   I want to  talk about the store and its people, and what it meant to me.Back in 2001, I was teaching 4-H kids about photography, and I called Huron Camera to see if I could get some expired film for the children to use in the projects.  Not only did we get expired film, we got a lot of it, and of course, it was all still fresh by my standards.  It really helped the kids out, and I never forgot the store's generosity.    My daughter Jorie and I occasionally drove out to Dexter on photo jaunts and I think we went in there in 2000 for the first time.  The bins in the back were the place to look for \"treasures\" and in those years, we were looking for Argus cameras and accessories, and Huron always had them.  I don't care how much ebay finds you get, nothing beats handling an item, or combing through a bin of \"stuff\" and finding something special.  It's that moment when the blood rushes to your head and the money flies from your wallet and your new-found prize comes home with you.  That's what made those forays to Huron Camera fun. If you were a long-time customer of Huron Camera, you undoubtedly remember when Milt Cambell ran the store and Eason, one of the salesmen that was usually there. My friend Bill Brudon told me to hold onto your wallet, because Eason was slick and would try and sell you something expensive and make you think that you were getting a deal.   I know I was not the first nor the last potential customer that the guy tried his \"charm\" on.    However, it was a game, and I know I came away with some buys later on that I knew were good deals in MY favor.   There is no doubt that the people that worked there loved photography and knew their stuff, and the personalities of the people there were part of the atmosphere.Until very recently, Huron Camera was the place to go for darkroom chemicals, and I know I spent some $$ there for developer and fixer.  Once Big George's closed, Huron Camera was IT locally.  They usually did a great job with C-41 film processing, and it was the last local lab that could process 120 film.   Sometimes I would pop in on a Saturday morning, and my film would be ready by lunchtime.  My buddy Marc Akemann and I often met at the store on a Saturday, and then went next door to Joe and Rosie's cafe for coffee and a bite to eat, sometimes talking for a couple of hours.  I'll miss those mornings, and the excuse to go to Dexter.Cheryl, waiting on Marc.CherylWhen the store changed ownership (2006?), I was in part, pleased that it didn't close right then, and also wondered about the future.  I made new friends, as Cheryl and George were often there working the counter, and Mike was in the film lab.   George is as knowledgeable a camera person as I know.  I don't think I was ever able to stump him with a question.  If anyone called or came to the  store with questions, he was the one there that could always give an answer.    All three are good photographers,  good people, and fun to be around.   In the end, I think about the people and the connections that were made there, and in my fantasy world of camera stores, there are elements of Huron Camera playing a big part.  I'll miss the place, and  like it or not, the place had character, charm, and its loss will be felt as one less gathering place for people with shared interests.  Mike, probably showing Marc a recent orchid photo.Thanks to all the people that made Huron Camera a special place. Good luck with whatever endeavors that follow.George. Camera guru.Looking out the front."},
{"title": "Sears and Ricoh SLRs", "date": "Sunday, December 14, 2014", "text": "Many years ago, when I was using K-mount cameras, I had a Ricoh KR-5 that I used in addition to my Pentax MG.  It was a robust camera that was not especially feature-rich, but it served its purpose.  I know that I purchased it on ebay and probably paid something like $40 for it.  That was before the digital deluge.More recently, I have been buying a few Sears and  Ricoh SLRs.  All of the K-series Sears SLR cameras were made by Ricoh, and were certainly a good value for the time, and are still to be recommended if you want a K-mount SLR.  The Ricoh-branded versions are also good, of course, and compared with bodies made by Pentax of the same period, are, in my opinion, better cameras. Sears KSX - with 135mm Takumar Take the Sears KSX, above.  It features manual and aperture-priority exposure with match-needle. +/- 2 stops exposure compensation by full stops, ISO 12-3200 film setting, X sync of 1/125 sec., shutter speeds of B, 4sec - 1/1000 sec.   I think it is the equivalent of the Ricoh KR-10. The KR-10 was a popular camera and sold well in the 1980-82 time frame.Sears KSX Super with 50mm f/2 lensThe Sears KSX Super is the equivalent of a Ricoh KR-10X (Not the KR-10 as described elsewhere online).  It features a lock setting on the shutter speed dial, surrounding a flush-mounted shutter release, A and M modes, with shutter speeds ranging from B, and 16 sec to 1/1000 sec.  A self-timer switch is to the L of the prism on the top deck. Exposure compensation dial is +/- 2 stops in 1/3 stop increments. A PC socket for strobes is also located on the front of the camera.Ricoh XR-7 with a the very good ACCESS 35-70mm F/2.5 zoom.My latest purchase, the Ricoh XR-7 is very similar to the KSX Super, but also features a multiple exposure button on the back  of the camera, depth of field preview button, an AE lock button, as well as a meter switch button on the front.  That's pretty full-featured, and I paid 9.99 for it. So, what does all this mean?  Basically, the Ricoh /Sears k-mount bodies are a bargain, and perform well, and while the Pentax logo may have more branding power, the Ricoh bodies often have more features and are better-made.  I have seen several K1000 cameras with de-silvered mirrors and wonky electronics in the Pentax ME and ME super.  You can frequently buy a Sears KSX or a Ricoh for less than a large pizza, including the lens.  They make great cameras for those wanting to use film in a reliable 35mm body.  All of the models take current silver-oxide or alkaline button cells, so no worry about that.  Based on my experience, I rate them a \"best buy\" and highly recommend them for the shooters out there. there are no lack of K-mount lenses from Pentax, Ricoh, Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and a host of other no-name brands.  If you need a manual, be sure to check out Mike Butkus' camera manuals site, and be sure to pay for his hard work. I am way behind in developing and scanning in the negatives, so be sure to check my Flickr pages."},
{"title": "Finding My Way in Photography", "date": "Saturday, November 29, 2014", "text": "meta-Sudek.Last night I was reading the latest issue of Lens Work (No. 115) and an essay by Brooks Jensen (\"Those Who Inspire Me\") featured comments about Ansel Adams and Josef Sudek -- two photographers that could not be more opposite in terms of recognition, subject matter, and methodology.  Yet, both were dedicated to their craft and vision.  Of the two, Sudek's work is more introspective, moody, but no less beautiful than prints by St. Ansel.   His subject matter is much more limited in scope, as many of his photographs were taken in his studio in Prague.  But to me, what I found interesting was that Sudek was no less dedicated than Adams, no less absorbed in realizing the quality of light was the key to defining an image, and no less productive, having a career that ended with his death in 1976, at the age of 83. This morning, still thinking about Sudek, I pulled out my copy of the monograph of Josef Sudek that was produced by Sonja Bullaty -- a beautifully-printed volume that was published in 1980, and given to me by my mentor Bill Brudon in 2001 or so.  As I read the introductory text and turned the pages, I realized that I  have a better appreciation for Sudek's work now than I did as an emerging photographer in 2001.  I didn't know what I didn't know back then.  Photography is not about the gear, the lenses, the latest film, the latest megapixels, or the latest body from Canon, Nikon, or Sony.   Photography is about your vision, and how you convey it to others.  Just as painting isn't about the tools and paints, photography should not be about the tools.  It's the end result, of whatever technique and tools that you used to convey your vision.  Knowing HOW to use those tools to do your work IS important.  And that is the key in my mind -- achieving competency with the tools takes time, as does the evolving nature of one's photographic pursuit.  I first got serious about photography in 2000, after, using cameras since 1972 or so.  I wanted to be more proficient with macro photography because a) I was an entomologist and b) because I was unhappy with my results at the time.  I soon learned the techniques and the tools required to do what I needed, and along the way, I found myself drawn into photography not as a means to an end, but as a form of self-expression.    It's taken me a decade to figure out what my vision is, but I think I am getting there.  I recently explained my thought process about a series of images to a couple of people that wanted to know about how I shot my photos at my latest exhibit. I recall saying \"Of course it doesn't look like this in reality, but this is how I feel it.\" I think that sums up Sudek's work - he truly felt whatever properties of what he was photographing, and carried those feelings into his images.  He contact-printed almost all of his images, so he had to get what he wanted pretty much in camera.   There is a quote by him that I will end with:\"I believe a lot in instinct. One should never dull it by wanting to know everything.\""},

{"title": "Svema Redscale 25", "date": "Wednesday, October 29, 2014", "text": "image courtesy of the Film Photography ProjectA while ago, the Film Photography Project sent me a trial roll of their Svema Redscale 25.  It's a low-ISO film that has lovely muted tones.    It's basically the Svema 100 color film, which I have already tried out, and liked.  The orange mask is lighter than the typical Kodak and Fuji offerings, so by turning it backwards and shooting through the film base, we get the redscale version, which is why it is ISO 25 -- 2 stops of exposure lost due to the orange base. I loaded up the film in my Sigma SA-7N camera, set the ISO to 25, and over the course of a week or two shot the roll of film.  With an ISO of 25, you probably should shoot this with lots of light or use a tripod for heavy overcast.  Anyhow, after shooting, the film went to Blue  Moon Camera for development, and they sent back perfectly-developed film cut and placed into standard negative sleeves from PrintFile, the kind that I use.  I scanned them in my Epson V700 scanner, and did not alter them except for removal of dust spots.    Here are a few for your viewing. I am not exactly a fan of redscale in general, because much of the time it is too contrasty and too red. However, the Svema film holds up well in sun, as well as in overcast conditions.  It gives a more \"vintage\" look to images, and is not grainy.  I suggest giving it a try if you want to shake up your photography a bit and have some fun with it."},
{"title": "The show goes on!", "date": "Wednesday, October 22, 2014", "text": "Last week I blogged about preparing for my latest one-man show at the Argus Museum.  \"Recent Black & White Work\" was put up last Thursday, and other than information cards falling off the wall, it went very smoothly.  The opening also coincided with the beginning of an Argus Collector's meeting, so I am sure the turnout reflected that.  However, there were a lot of people jammed into the narrow viewing space, and I really enjoyed talking with the attendees.  For the first time ever, I sold more than one print - five, actually, and it was clear that I made some good choices in my selection of images.  I also got a lot of good feedback.  I asked some people what their favorites were and why.  Some found that a certain image really resonated with them, and there were emotional connections to a few images, as well.    To me, as a photographer, those were really good reinforcement to my own judgement, and the unsolicited praise from people was gratifying. I shoot for myself, unless it is a paid assignment from someone.  My subjects vary, my choice of tools varies, and the medium varies.  That is one way for me to keep \"fresh\" and try things.  If you have read through this blog, you will obviously see that.  I don't think I could be content with just ONE camera and one lens.  I am sure I could do a much better job than I did 30 years ago if that is all that I had.  However, being creative for me means being able to use a variety of lenses to achieve a desired result.  Sometimes it is purely serendipitous, but other times, I know what a certain combination will do, and I set out with a goal in mind of getting a desired result. My images of Fayette State Park were  just that.  I knew that the CCTV lens on my Olympus EPL-1 gave me a Petzal-like effect when wide open, and shooting in monochrome gave just the look I wanted...a homage to a late 1800s appearance.  Some people were curious about how I got the effect, and we had wonderful discussions about \"getting it in camera\" vs. post-processing.I did shoot some crowd shots at the reception, but they are all on film cameras and I have yet to get them developed. For those, I went simple-- Olympus Infinity and a Nikon One-Touch 35.  I did photograph the setup before it opened, so some of those images are here.   I really was very pleased with how it all turned out.  The exhibit runs until December 5, and the Argus Museum, at 525 West William Street, Ann Arbor, is open from 9-5, M-F."},

Parking is available on the side streets, and there are usually a couple of spots open in the lot for visitors.This exhibit features only photographs I have taken in 2013-14,  and there are four main groupings - Chicago, Fayette State Park, Lake Huron Shoreline, and assorted images from larger projects that are in progress.  Chicago features 6 images taken in less than 12 hours while I was there on a business trip, All were taken with my Nikon 1 camera, which is capable of some most excellent results at low ISO settings.   The second set, Fayette State Park, were taken with an Olympus EPL1 and a C-mount lens, which gives the same out of focus effect as a Petzval lens.  The images are somewhat dreamy at the edges, but sharp in the focus spot.  I chose them over the other film-based images due to the effect from that lens, which gives them a period look.   The Lake Huron Shoreline images were all taken with a Nikon D90 and a 35mm 1.8 lens.  The last set features images from a variety of film cameras, and were shot at various locations in Michigan and New York State.The 33 prints are all sized at 6x9,\" matted to 11x14.\"  I am satisfied with my choice of images, and it was hard winnowing things down.  The venue is adequate for smaller print sizes, and of course, it also keeps my cost down.  Each print is priced at $40-$45. Spotting prints.  Silver-gelatin prints almost always need to be retouched after mounting (or before).    Small specks on the negative show up as white spots on the prints.  It used to be that one would use \"Spot tone\" and a fine brush to fix the spots, but \"Spotting Pens\" with different densities of black pigment are now used, and the ones I am using here were purchased about 8 years ago. The worst is having a pinhole in the emulsion, which shows up as a black dot on the print.  There, it's better to scan the negative and fix those defects in a graphics program and then have the digital file printed as a c-print.  I use Mpix.com for all of my c-prints."},
{"title": "Portra 100T  - Another fine film....gone and rediscovered.", "date": "Sunday, September 28, 2014", "text": "In this year's acquisitions of  various films, I ended up with some Kodak Portra 100T.  First of all, I did not even know that Kodal produced a Tungsten light-balanced C-41 film.  I am familiar with all of the typical Tungsten emulsions that are E-6, and there WERE a lot of them from Kodak and Fuji. It made sense to have slide films made for tungsten lighting, and whether they were used for documenting art objects (as many art departments did), indoor shooting, or night scenes, tungsten balanced films were necessary for proper color balance under typical non-florescent lighting.  Used outdoors, one merely needed to have an 85B compensating filter to get more accurate color under daylight conditions.  Obviously, the Digital Onslaught rendered the use use of tungsten films obsolete for professional use, since we can choose any white balance we want.    Despite this, I enjoy shooting tungsten slide film and then having it cross-processed for a unique look.Imagine my surprise in finding two rolls of Kodak Portra 100T!  It sure makes sense to have a fine-grained tungsten emulsion in C-41, given the dearth of E-6 labs.  However, this film expired in 2002. I suppose Kodak thought it would be used a lot for portraiture, since C-41 films filled that niche...at the time.  I loaded a roll into my Konica Autoreflex TC and shot it it a variety of conditions, sometimes using it outdoors with an 85B filter, and sometimes not.  I shot it at night, I shot it indoors under mixed lighting, too.  I like the film, and despite it being 12 years out of date, the results at box speed were very good.  It's fun and a bit sad finding out about films that one didn't know existed, and to find that they are still giving great results long after their \"end date.\" In 2002, the digital tidal wave was beginning, and the pros were adopting DSLRs as soon as they came out.  I know that the tungsten E-6 films held out a bit longer because of their specialized uses, but the Portra 100T was discontinued by Kodak in 2006.  Ektar 100 became the ISO 100 C-41 champ, and since C-41 negs can be scanned and color balanced on the computer, the Portra 100T became irrelevant.  It's still a lot of fun to use, though.Here are some selected shots from my first roll of the Portra 100T:"},
{"title": "Alternative Processes - Cyanotype", "date": "Wednesday, September 24, 2014", "text": "I'm pretty much a straightforward photographer. I have dabbled in cyanotypes, large format, pinhole, print toning, and so forth.  I remain a 35mm and medium format shooter, and use films and lenses that give me the \"look\" that I am searching for.  I greatly respect those that decide to use alternative processes such as wet-plate, platinum/palladium, bromoil, van dyke, photogravure, and cyanotype to become their medium.  I can't tell you much about the other processes from personal experience except cyanotype, which I have played with a bit.  Cyanotype is actually the simplest \"Alt process\" it uses iron ions and not silver to produce the image.  It's also a very old process, invented by the English astronomer John Herschel in 1846.   Blueprint paper is a form of cyanotype, and it is very easy to use -- and sold as the \"Sunprint\" kits in museums and art stores.   Today, one can make digital negatives and use them to produce stunning cyanotype compositions.   I start with this as a background to the exhibit that ends this weekend at the Argus Museum in Ann Arbor.  A show by photographers from Wayne State University titled A Matter of Light and Memory features many cyanotypes and toned cyanotypes.  I especially liked the varied presentation of the cyanotypes on cloth.  The cyanotype process allows one to get creative with the substrate, the presentation, and the implementation of the process.  Cyanotypes are a great medium to use where traditional darkrooms no longer exist, as the set-up is pretty easy.  The chemicals are also relatively inexpensive and easy to work with. Here are a few views of the exhibit, taken with my cellphone, and not a real camera...You can learn more about cyanotypes here:Alternative PhotographyThe Getty InstituteBlueprints on fabricInstructablesThe Argus Museum is located at 525 West William Street, Ann Arbor.  The show ends 09/26/2014!I wish I had remembered to put this up earlier."},
{"title": "It's All About The Lens.", "date": "Saturday, August 16, 2014", "text": "While I have long been a mostly Nikon shooter, I realize that there are other lenses out there that are really amazing, and that they don't mount on a Nikon.  Since I am shooting film here, I am not going out to buy a Sony Alpha or some other mirrorless digital camera to mount different lenses on.  No way.  This boy is shooting film as much as possible (and yes, I do own two Nikon DSLRs).  For instance, Konica has always had a reputation for manufacturing some excellent glass.  I was given a Konica Autoreflex TC by my mother-in-law last year.  The camera body wasn't working, but the 40mm 1.8 lens was perfect, so I bought a Konica Autoreflex T body on ebay for about $15.  Then, I saw the 57mm f/1.4 at Huron Camera -- an amazing lens I have read about elsewhere. I bought it, and it is one of those lenses that quickly becomes a favorite.  Wide-open it has a bokeh that will make some of those bokeholics pee their pants.   My Autoreflex T's meter is a bit off, so I usually use sunny-16 or a hand-held meter for my exposures.  What I have REALLY come to love is shooting the expired Panatomic-X (that I bought back in March at the estate sale) with this lens.  I am getting some images that I have really been liking.  Shooting late in the day with soft light at wide-open aperture or close to it is giving me some results that I am quite pleased with. There are many other lenses out there that justify owning a body that they fit just to shoot with them.  It's all in the glass... the body is just there to keep the film in.    What's your favorite lens?"},
{"title": "Bag of Surprises", "date": "Wednesday, August 13, 2014", "text": "Last weekend I stopped by the Ann Arbor Recycle Reuse thrift store to see what I might find in the way of cameras, etc.  I found a few photographic books that I decided to pickup, and I was looking through a jumble of things in one corner towards the back, when I spied one of those Kodak Film cooler bags.  It was ratty-looing with mildew on it, but I looked inside, anyway.  Much to my surprise there were two decent Polaroid pack film cameras and a bunch of accessories.  The cashier was somebody new, and I offered $5, as the bag was unpriced.  He looked inside, and thought that \"some of the small parts were probably worth more than the cameras\" and came back with $7.50.  Sold.  I was going to offer $10, but Adrienne (who obviously is a shrewder person than I) thought that was too high to start with.  So, I saved at least $2.50. Once I got the bag home, I immediately started looking through it.  It has sat around in someone's basement for a long time, I think.  However, the two cameras, a Polaroid 450 and a 340 were in pretty good shape.  There was a cardboard box of exactly the right size inserted into the bag for rigidity, and tucked between the box and the bag were a bunch of papers, including  a few old b&w Polaroids, some more recent-looking b&w prints, instructions for the Polaroid cameras and accessories, as well as the manual and papers for a Canon Canonet-28. A Polaroid self-timer, close-up kit, UV filter, M3 bulbs, 2 flashbulb holders, a screwdriver, and a Kalimar telephoto lens for the Polaroid completed the kit.  Oh, and there were 4 of the small tubes that hold the coater strips for the old b&w prints. All of the items work, and I think I will keep at least the Polaroid 340.  It has a real rangefinder (as does the 450) and takes a single battery.  The close-up kit and self-timer are also keepers.  The 450 has a nicer Zeiss Rangefinder, but I'll need to check out the battery situation before I decide to keep it.  Polaroid made a plethora of models of the folding land cameras, and some are obviously better than others. The 340 lacks a tripod mount, but that is not a deal-breaker.I was very interested in the photographs.  The Polaroids look they are from the mid to late 1980s, and the photos of the bartender and the waitress look like they are newer, perhaps 1990 or so. I wonder where they were taken? It's fun finding bags like this.  I cleaned everything up before I photographed it.  I have seen the Kodak cooler before, but this is a first time owning one. In the first photo, you can see a young man in one of those Papasan chairs and the Kodak bag is behind his shoulder.The last two photos are at a different location, and are printed from 35 mm negatives. Perhaps from the Canonet 28?A nice little find, and worth every penny!"},

So, I chose a 24mm 2.8, 55 mm Micro-Nikkor, 50mm 1.4, 105mm 2.5, and 35-135 Tokina zoom that I recently purchased. A selection of filters - Red, Yellow, Orange, ND4, Polarizer,  split  graduated ND filter, and one close-up diopter were all that I needed. I mostly used the Polarizer and the Orange filter.  A small flash, cable release, lens brush, extra batteries, and business cards pretty much fill the Tamrac bag.In the second bag, The Yashica A and the Leica M2, my new Sekonic light meter, film, cable release are pretty much it.I later added the Yashica Microtec to finish up the roll of film that was in it.In all, I shot about 10 rolls over the course of the 5 days -- and did a lot more shooting with the Leica than I expected I would.  The Nikon 1 got a fair amount of use, as well -- and it has proven to be a reliable and quality travel camera.  What I didn't bring is just as noteworthy.  I didn't bring the Mamiya C330, nor my DSLR bag, nor the Pentax 6x7 or the F100, etc.  I kept things pretty simple, and it pays off in working better with a small amount of gear.I'll close with a cliche sunset shot from Preque Isle, one of my favorite places to shoot in Marquette. It was taken with my Nikon 1J1 on a carbon-fiber tripod, .5 sec at f/16, ISO 100 -.3 compensation, with the 10-30mm zoom at 30mm."},

A blog is a way to express one's self, and when I am feeling creative, the post come easily.  When Iam not, or too busy, it does not get written.  I don't have a schedule or a plan for blog posts. They happen when I feel like writing.  When I started this blog in 2006, I really had no idea where I would be going with it, but I knew that I loved photography and using cameras of all sorts, hence the name Random Camera Blog. RCB has been a fun outlet for me, and has kept me writing about photography.  Sometimes I put out 4 or 5 posts in a months, sometimes only one. I try to keep them interesting, and I thought you might be interested in the stats. Here is a capture of stats from over the past weekend:The average monthly pages views hovers around 5000, which I think is pretty good.  The all-time most viewed post is the one about the Argus 75, and the second is a review of the Gakken-Flex.  Wow.  Who knew that the Argus 75 post would be so popular?  It's the first thing that shows up in searches on that camera, too.  So, I am quite pleased to have a lot of followers as well as many visitors. I hope that viewers find my information useful and that a post has inspired them to try something new.Only one thing bugs the hell out of me regarding the blog -- I really dislike when someone looks like they are making a comment about a post, but it is really an advertisement for their web site. Do you really think I want a link to some half-assed web store selling digital stuff?  Nope.  You get deleted.  I appreciate real comments and am always willing to reply if you have a question.I don't want to just write a bout the blog.  I didn't get to 500 posts without writing SOMETHING about cameras.  As you can tell from my posts, I have had a lot of them pass through my hands over the years.  Some I keep, others I use for a while, and then sell, give-away, or trade for something else.  Recently, I have written quite a bit about the cameras that I have been selling for someone else.  I also have a soft spot for camera bargains.  Here is one such bargain...  I was in the local thrift shop a few weeks ago and picked up this nice Canon EOS Rebel X 35mm SLR with the 35-80 kit lens for the sum of 10 dollars.  A decent pizza costs more than that.  Three bottles of wine can cost that at Trader Joe's.  A six-pack of beer can cost that.  Hell, a roll of film can cost $10.  Now, I have gone through my Canon EOS phase a while back, and sold off all the Canon gear that I had acquired.  However, seeing that lonely camera in the case for $10 made me buy it.  It was pretty clean, and only needed a fresh set of batteries (CR123)  and film.  The Rebel X (or at least THIS rebel X) does not have a built-in pop-up flash.  From the Canon Museum web site: \"Based on the popular EOS Kiss marketed in October 1993, the Rebel X was for the North American market. The Rebel X did not have a built-in flash, auto date back, and metered manual like the Kiss. The Rebel X was 55 g lighter than the Kiss..\"   So, the camera is 21 years old.  Wow.  It still takes great photos, and weighs less than 500 grams.  In fact, it is so light that it can be carried in the hand without fatigue.  I have shot one roll with it, and am working on another.  If you are a mostly digital user, and want to experiment with film, find yourself a cheap Rebel and use the lenses that you already have (except for the lenses that are only for APS-C DSLRs).  So, for less than a dinner, you can find yourself a decent modern film camera with features that you are probably already used to on your DSLR.Some images from the first roll, shot on Kodak B&W C-41 400 film.The camera just plain works, and remember, yes, it's not the camera, but the person using it--however, some cameras do make it easier to \"get the picture.\" The EOS Rebel was a fantastic entry into using modern SLRs, and certainly still holds its own against later Rebels that appeared.Thanks for viewing the 500th post of Random Camera Blog, and USE FILM!"},
{"title": "Living Light with the Leica M2", "date": "Saturday, July 12, 2014", "text": "The only Leica that I have previously owned was a very old Model A - the first version without a removable lens.  That particular camera had been given to me by a woman in her 90s, and she had used it a lot many years before.  By the time it came into my hands, it was a relict of sorts, and as far as I was concerned, no more useful to me than using an Argus A.  So I sold it for a tidy sum on ebay, and bought a camera and other things with the money.  I have no regrets, as it was around 2001, and the camera I bought - a used Nikon F2 was very useful to me.  Another time someone had a nice Leica IIIf that I tried out, and it was awful for a glasses wearer.  The viewfinder was not any better than my Argus C3.  Mechanically a nice camera, though.  I suppose it was one of those things  that you either love or don't on first sight.  I never bought into the Leica mystique, mostly I suppose because I couldn't BUY into it.  Between the obscene prices paid for (used and new)  lenses  and the bodies, and the fact there there are so many \"poor man's Leicas\" out there, I knew that I would never be able to afford one.  As far as \"poor man's Leicas\" I think I have used every one of them - Canon QL17, Konica Auto S2, Yashica rangefinders of various models, Fed 5, Olympus 35 RC, Minolta Hi-Matic 11, Contax G1, Konica Hexar, and I am sure there have been others.  Of those cameras, the only one I believe might actually qualify is the Fed 5.  Why?  Interchangeable lenses and the ability to shoot fully manually without any sort of automation. The Fed 5 has a better VF than the Leica IIIf that I tried, for sure. So, where does the subject of the title of this post come in?If you have read my previous posts, you'll know that I am selling the photo gear from the estate of a deceased photographer.  There have been some very amazing cameras that I have tried out - (a) to make sure that they work and (b) to satisfy my curiosity.One of the cameras - a Leica M2 with a 35mm f/1.4 Summilux has been in my hands for over a month now.  I have shot 5 rolls of film with it, and have become comfortable using it.  Its value is high due to the fantastic 35mm Summilux attached to it, and that is something I have to try and not think about when carrying it.  To anyone else, it's just an old-looking \"obsolete\"  film camera.  The M2 body has it share of small dings and signs of use, but it works beautifully.  The lens is clear and also works well.  The more I used the camera, the more I came to want it.  So, in lieu of a 25% commission for the gear I am selling, I'm taking the M2 and lens as partial payment.    I would never be able to buy one outright. My impression of the  M2 so far is that I now understand why this 57 year old camera has such a following.  Yes, there are newer M models, some even have a sensor instead of film -- and cost as much as 3 month's pay (at least for me.)  The M2's viewfinder is wonderfully bright and sharp, and the frame lines adjust automatically for most of the lenses attached to it. I bought a Fotodiox M39>M adapter so I could use the Industar-61 50mm f/2.8 lens from my Fed 5, and it works very well on the M2. It takes a little while to feel how a camera works in one's hands, and become less conscious about the controls to the point where making a photo is more about what in in your head than what is in your hands.  I get it.  The M2 does this very quickly.  I bought a new Sekonic light meter - Twinmate L-208 which is lightweight and can be attached to the flash shoe on the the camera.  I tried that, and it makes the camera bulkier, so I use the meter on the lanyard.  For sunny-16 lovers like me, I only need to use the meter in tricky lighting situations, or indoors.  I am getting better at loading the film, which I think has been a sore point with the Leicas, but I understand it now.  No film doors flying open.  Oh, and this camera is soooo quiet!I have always said that I am not a rangefinder guy.  I much prefer the feedback that I get from an SLR and the ability to change lenses, do macro, etc.  However, there are a lot of things I shoot that a 35mm or 50mm lens is all that is required, and the ergonomics and sharpness of the M2 have convinced me that this is the carry-around camera to go to for road trips, etc.  It fits easily into a small bag, and doesn't need batteries.  A few rolls of film, a filter or two, and the meter, and I am set.  Living light?  I think so.  This camera does make me think about light. So, to close, here are a few photos thus far.  Some are still waiting to be developed.Mason, MIPortland, MIMason, MICharlotte, MIMichigan League, Ann ArborPortland, MILyons, MIAnn Arbor, MIbasement of the League, Ann Arborrural SE Michigan."},
{"title": "Envoy Joy", "date": "Saturday, June 28, 2014", "text": "I am in the midst of selling a camera estate for an acquaintance, so I have been busy with that and not doing much blogging.  One of the side benefits of doing this is that I often get my hands on cameras that i have never seen or used before.  Sometimes they are expensive high-end tools like the previous post on the Plaubel Makina 670.  Other times, it might be a strange obscure camera, such as this post -- the Envoy.The Envoy was produced in the 1950s in England.  It is a fixed focus wide-angle box camera that takes 120 film as well as 2 1/4 x 3 1/4 plates.  The wire frame finder is all you need to gauge your composition.  The rear part of the finder has parallax correction for close-ups.  Since it is fixed focus, your closest focus is achieved with the smallest aperture:f/11 -- 10 - 60 ftf/16 -- 6 - 400 ftf/22 -- 4 - ∞ ftf/32 -- 1 - ∞ ftYou can set your shutter speed from B to 1/125 sec, so this camera works best with slower films, and I used Verichrome Pan (expired in 1997) to test out the camera.  Using sunny-16, I was able to get very good images at f/16 and 1/100 sec.Mason, MIAll of the shots were hand-held, and there is a tripod socket on the camera.  Wide-angle is equivalent to 25mm on a 35mm camera -- which is pretty damn wide on medium format, especially in 6x9 cm.    I think the framing was pretty accurate, given this was my first experience with this camera.  I currently have a roll of expired Panatomic-X in it, so that ought to be interesting.These cameras are rarely seen here in the US, and are more common in the UK and Europe.  Prices range from $200 on up, depending on condition.  Considering the wide-angle aspect of the camera, it's a relative bargain.Portland, MI I probably won't hang onto this camera, but I am happy to have used it for a while.  I think anyone that wants the simplicity and compactness of the Envoy to shoot wide-angle images would really appreciate the camera.   Stopped down, the lens is very good, and everything will be in focus from at least 10 feet to infinity.  Not too shabby for a \"box camera.\"Portland, MI"},
{"title": "Cameras beyond my budget - The Plaubel Makina 670", "date": "Sunday, June 15, 2014", "text": "Every once in a while, it is fun trying out a camera that I always thought was cool, but could never afford. It usually only happens when I am in the process of selling cameras for someone else.  In this instance, I am readying a lot of cameras for ebay for an acquaintance.  One of the ones that first caught my eye was a Plaubel Makina 670. Made in Japan, the Plaubel 670 is a 6x7 rangefinder with a collapsible lens bellows (think giant Kodak Retina).  This particular model, the 670 is an improvement over the 67, as it can take 120 or 220 film.  With 10 exposures on a roll of 120, 220, sure looks like a better bet for this easily-carried camera.  Also note that this camera has had strips of grip-tack applied so that it is easier to hold.  I think it's a great idea for a camera such as this.  The 670 also has a light meter, and the rangefinder is very clear and easy to focus.  Note that the lens is made by Nikon, and that the maximum aperture is f/2.8 -- a really nice feature for softening the background when doing portraits.  In use, the camera is easy to open and close.  The viewfinder is clear, and the 80mm lens (40mm equivalent for 35mm) gives a slightly wider angle than the typical 105mm focal length one sees for 6x7.  The camera weighs nearly 3 pounds, so its not as heavy as the Pentax 6x7.  With the lens retracted, the camera has a thin profile that easily fits into a large coat pocket or messenger bag.  I shot 2 rolls of B&W plus a roll of color.  The first roll, expired Plus-X, looks very good, but I can't get the film to lie flat enough in the scanner to scan without distortion. I'll have to make some prints, I suppose.This is obviously not a cheap camera, with used prices on ebay starting around $1400.  I am glad that I had a chance to try it out, but 6x7 isn't my favorite format, so I won't be buying this one!  There isn't a lot on the web about the Plaubel Makina 670, but this link is useful."},
{"title": "The Sigma SA-7 - A cleanly designed 35mm SLR", "date": "Monday, May 26, 2014", "text": "I saw one of these cameras recently, and it piqued my interest.  What's a camera guy do?  Head over to eBay and see what is there.  I bought a clean, like-new SA-7 with the two kit lenses (28-80, 70-300mm) for $60. The camera arrived quickly, and it didn't take me long to figure out the controls.   Like a lot of photographers, I questioned why anyone would buy a camera with a lens mount that was restricted to Sigma lenses.   However, I can see where this camera would appeal to someone that wanted an SLR with a good feature set at a reasonable price. Some people can go a long way with just two AF zoom lenses.  One thing I found while doing a little online searching is that there are M42-SA mount adapters, making the SA-7 easily capable of using my M42 lenses and metering with them.  So, I have one of those ordered for the price of $10.  About the camera body - The SA-7 is a lightweight 35mm SLR with easily accessed controls, and has PSAM modes, and in manual, the shutter speeds range from B - 4sec - 1/2000 sec. and X is 1/90 sec.  It will use DX codes to set the film speed (25-5000), or the ISO setting can be dialed in manually for a range of 6-6400.   It features a typical TTL phase detection system for the AF, and an AF working range of EV-1 to EV+18.  The camera takes two CR-2 batteries.The pentamirror gives a 92% field of view, and there is a diopter adjustment on the eyepiece. Metering is TTL 8-segment, average metering, and center area metering. +/- exposure compensation is 3 stops in 1/2 stop increments.  Auto bracketing in 1/2 stop increments; AE lock, Self-timer in 2 or 10 sec delays, built-in flash, mirror-lockup, multiple exposure, and remote control (IR remote) functions.  In short, this camera has mas more features than say, a Nikon N80.  Mirror-lockup and DOF preview is a nice feature, too. So, I have to wonder -- what if this camera had a Nikon F-mount or a Canon EF mount? I suspect there are licensing issues, but it probably would have sold well.  The camera body is no more plasticky than an EOS Rebel or a Nikon N80, and is has a nice feel to it.  The only downside is that it requires SA-mount lenses for AF.  Some people may be perfectly content with the lens selection, and I should add that since Sigma has been making DSLRs, many of those lenses will fit the SA-7 (and SA-9).Huron Camera in Dexter has several new in box SA-7 kits, and of course, one can go the ebay route and pick these up quite cheaply.  If you are looking for something that is AF, shoots film, and is full-featured and are not committed to a camera brand, the SA-7 might just be the right fit for you.All the images that follow were shot on Fujicolor 400 film."},

Overall, I was pleased with the results.  The beauty of using the Argus is that it is so simple to use for long exposures.  Second, as you can see in the photo of the camera, I have an accessory viewfinder for framing.  Almost everything was shot at infinity at f/8 to f/16.This was the first time I had used this particular C3 with the 35mm lens, and while there is some flare in some of the photos, it worked well and I think that I will try it again with some Ektachrome 64T, which I seem to have a lot of sitting in the film fridge.If you have put off shooting night scenes with film, give it a try.  You don't need to use Tungsten E-6 film, as any color C-41 film will also do fine.  Bracket your shots, and err on the side of overexposure.  Use a tripod and remote release, and any camera with a B setting will do.  Set your aperture to f/16, focus on infinity and have fun.  You can use a meter, but it's going to be tricky at night.  However, here is a good reference source for exposures."},

Like allROYAL GOLD Films, it is designed and produced to meet the needs ofknowledgeable and discriminating photographers who want more fromphotographs than general-purpose films can provide.ROYAL GOLD 25 Film offers micro-fine grain, extremelyhigh sharpness, and the capability for an extremely high degree of enlargement.The film is designed for exposure with daylight or electronic flash.Use ROYAL GOLD 25 Film in cameras that allow you to setthe film speed manually, or in cameras that will correctly set the film speedautomatically from the DX code on the magazine. (Some automatic 35 mm camerasdo not read the DX code for ISO 25/15° film and will underexpose it.) This filmrequires more precise exposure control than general purpose films.Other features include—• Extremely high sharpness• Enlargements of superb clarity • Incorporates KODAK T-GRAIN™ Emulsions• Micro-fine grain• Designed for processing in KODAK FLEXICOLOR Chemicalsfor Process C-41• Can be processed with other ROYAL GOLD Films, KODAKGOLD, EKTAR, and EKTACOLOR Films, KODAK Pro Films, and KODAK VERICOLOR andEKTAPRESSProfessional Films• Built-in dye-masking color couplers• Provides quality color reproduction withoutsupplementary maskingBasically, it issupposed to be a fine-grained  slowemulsion that allows big enlargements. Note the label actually indicated that it was for\"SLR cameras.\"  Apparently, itwas not aimed at point and shoots of the time.The thing aboutusing expired films is that in most instances one has little information on howthe film was stored over the years.  Itcould have been in a glove box of a car or in the freezer, and everywhere inbetween.  Of course, expired film/distressedfilm crazies LOVE it when the film's expiredness (is that a word?) shows.  While I do appreciate the unexpected resultsfrom expired film, I would never use it without testing for shots that I couldnot duplicate (having learned THAT lesson long ago!) Here is a good thread on Photo.net about Ektar 25I had some hope forthis film, as it was in a lot of expired film at my local camera store.  However, it may have come in with someone'sbag of camera gear.  There were 2 rolls,one in the box, and one in the plastic film can.  I chose to use the one without the box.  Generally, (at least in the b&w world),slower films retain their speed far longer than faster films.  While the rule of thumb that has floated aroundis to lower the working ISO rating by 1 stop for each decade (i.e., 20 year old400 speed film = 100 ISO now), slower films usually are less sensitive to theravages of time.  I shot the roll ofRG 25 at the box speed, and took it to Huron Camera in Dexter forprocessing.  When I got the film back, Iwas a bit surprised as the color shifting was quite intense.  In fact, it seemed that it lacked quite a bitof sensitivity, as the negatives are decidedly blue-ish.   Reading the photo.net thread given above, Ifound this nugget:  There is a .2decrease in yellow dye density between 18 and 28 years. Magenta and cyan don'teven exhibit a .1 decrease at 100 years. This means the negative appears moreblue and the resulting print will be yellow.So, with regards tothis particular film, I would say that it should be shot at ISO 6.  I have one box of the Royal Gold 25 left -- contactme if you want it and I'll mail it to you. I also have several rolls of Ektar 25 in 120 in my fridge that came fromthe fridge of another photographer that kept his film well all the years thathe had it.  I will give the Ektar 25 atry, but i am not expecting a miracle here. The suggestion from 2005 was toshoot the Ektar 25 at ISO 12.  I will usethat as a starting point. Here are the images that follow -- grainy, and due to trying to make the scans look better, there has been a lot of attempted color correction.  The negatives of course, were also quite thin.  You can see the obvious blue shift that has taken place."},

I keep wondering what cameras I'll take to such events, and it seems that i always pack more than I use.  This time, I am bringing my Mamiya C330, a couple of Nikon bodies and lenses, and a couple of toy cameras...and a Polaroid or two.  That should do it.

{"title": "The Olive Argus A", "date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2014", "text": "It is well-established that the Argus model A was the one camera that really made 35mm photography accessible and affordable to the average American.  Introduced in 1936, the International Radio Corp. sold an estimated 30,000 cameras in the first month for $12.50 each.  Later changing its name to the Argus Corp., the company improved upon the basic design of the A, with many iterations of the A series. Eventually, the Argus C3 became the top-seller, being the longest-lived camera produced in the USA with a production run of almost 30 years! The Argus A is a pocket camera with a telescoping lens tube that springs out with a twist from the locking position.  The shutter and aperture are controlled from the front of the lens barrel.  Typically, the I.R.C.  Anastigmat lens had a modest maximum aperture of f/4.5.  Shutter speeds were controlled by the Argus Ilex shutter, with B,T, and 1/25, 1/50, 1/100, and 1/200 sec speeds.  The uncoated lens is definitely more than adequate, and stopped down it was fairly sharp. The early Argus A cameras have a single brass sprocket wheel and no tripod mount.  While 99.9% of the Argus A cameras were produced with black Bakelite bodies, a small number were produced in different colors; olive, gray, red, and possibly white.  Probably only a few hundred examples of the color versions were made.  Less than that survived to the present.In good condition, an Olive Argus A is worth about $175, the other colors slightly more.  If you find the holy grail white Model A, you are sitting on a treasure.Its been many years since I have shot with any Argus A, and I suppose it is time to use one of the black models for that.  Maybe this year's Argus Day in August will be a good time to do that."},

The 42mm focal length is just fine, and the largest aperture of f/2.8 is not limiting for the kind of photography I do.  The top-mounted shutter speed dial is also well-placed.

This is an awesome feature, and I put it to the test this past week.  I like the camera so much, I sold my Rollei and my Hassy.  If any camera can get me back in the darkroom to print again, it is this camera.The Mamiya C330 was designed to be a professional-grade system (it even says \"professional\" on the front of the body), and everything about it says versatility and reliability.  All I had to do was replace the foam light seals on the back and I was ready to start using the camera.  I didn't have a manual, and one is very helpful with this camera.  Thankfully, Butkus.org has manuals.  This site is also very useful. Using the camera comes pretty naturally to me.  The focus screen is nice and bright, and the controls are easy to find.  It does pay off to read the manual, as this is a more complex beast than the Yashica A or my Rolleiflex Automat.  I used my Gossen Pilot light meter and several different rolls of film.  I have yet to send the color Fuji 400H off to be developed, but I did develop the B&W.

My first question after shooting a roll of something new is, \"Do I like it?\"    That is, if I like the appearance of the negatives when I hang the film to dry, it's a good chance I'll like the results.My first roll of the FN64 was shot in my always-dependable Nikon FM2N with a 50mm f/2 lens -- the standby.  I shot the film at the box ISO of 64.  The film was developed in Rodinal 1:25 for 6 minutes and 15 seconds at 20°C.  I greatly enjoyed seeing the used developer pour out as a dark purple -- much as when I used to shoot the Agfa films.I shot the roll walking around the campus during my lunch hour last week -- one of the days where it seemed like we are finally in the grip of spring and not winter.  The film has some grain which may be more noticeable due using Rodinal.  However, the grain is not unpleasing, and the shadow detail is very good. I am pleased with the results from the scans, and it looks like this film would produce some good prints.  I'll shoot the other two rolls, and probably buy a bulk roll soon.  Thanks to Mike and the FPP for giving me a chance to try this out!"},

It was a thawing March day, which was a relief from Michigan's weather.  We drove around and Adrienne also enjoyed seeing things she overlooked while growing up so close by.  It is true that we take so many things for granted when we are young, and going back to a place much later is like seeing it for the first time. I shot with my Nikon F100 mostly using my 24-120 Nikkor AF zoom with Tri-X and Arista Ultra 100 (perhaps Fomapan?).  The film was developed in D76 and scanned.   I am pretty happy with what I got there in such a short time.  It would be nice to go back when things are green and see more.Gridley ChapelThe MillThe Millyes, a train runs through it.Outside the old lime kilnsthe MillInside the lime kilnthis place just wants to be photographedinside the lime kiln.outside the lime kilnthe old Borden evaporated milk plant."},

{"title": "Photography of a Different Sort", "date": "Monday, March 17, 2014", "text": "The wonderful dinosaur mural at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural HistoryMy day job isn't that of being a photographer, although I do use photography in various forms to accomplish various tasks.  I am the Insect Division Collection Manager at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology in Ann Arbor, MI.  Besides the 3.5 million specimens, we have various ancillary items such as photographs, transparencies, maps, journals, field notebooks, and other analog recordings that are part of the collection.  Last week I attended a workshop at Yale, under the iDigBio program.  The workshop, \"Digitization of Source Materials\" was intended to share information and provide a set of documents relating to the why and how we digitize (making non-digital items available digitally) our archives and non-specimen objects in our collections.  It is a different sort of protocols, as we want to be consistent in our workflows and end-products and the way we want people to access them.1920s Photographic tools at Machu Pichu.  (YPMNH)Consider a photograph.  You can digitize it by placing it on a flatbed scanner (easy) or by photographing it with a digital camera (usually more cumbersome).  Once you have it scanned, you need to add metadata that describes the image, catalog it so that the object is unique, and make it accessible via whatever software is used.  Think of uploading a photo to Flickr and not labeling or tagging it.  It would be hard to find again. Same thing for digital archives of any sort.  Now multiply that by potentially many thousands of items in a collection, with different origins (bound notebooks, photos, etc.,)  and you can see why some standards and protocols need to be addressed.Various source materials at the Yale Peabody MuseumWhile at Yale, I was delighted to be able to see their digital imaging labs that are used by the museums there.  Imagine a large room with walls at 18% gray, a catwalk, and all the tables and lighting one may need to get the job done -- I was prcatically drooling.   Then, they showed us a machine with 2 cameras that allows them to photograph up to 1600 pages per hour -- automatically.  Very, very cool.Book digitization at 1600 pages per hour.Photography amounts to making an image on some recording surface, and whether it is film or a sensor is unimportant in terms of the technique in getting the object photographed.  The post-image work is certainly quite different, though.  It is the ability to do so many amazing things with digital images that makes the museum work so important.  We can share our resources with the rest of the world, and in doing so, we are making research on so many things much richer in content. It was great seeing the wonderful work space at the Yale digital imaging studios.  Any photographer that shoots in a studio setting would love that space!My dream studio at YaleIt was also good to see a university where scholarship is valued over athletics, substance over hype.   Okay, so you say it's Ivy league, not the Big \"Ten\".  The Big can't even count right.

{"title": "Local Photographer  I wish I knew... Stanley C. Livingston", "date": "Monday, March 03, 2014", "text": "On Saturday, my buddy Marc Akemann and I  were alerted to a local estate sale that featured some darkroom equipment.  Before I went over, I looked up the sale online, and sure enough, amidst all the other things in the house, was a darkroom and a fridge FILLED with film.  I hadn't heard of anyone recently  passing away that I knew, which is perhaps why this sale was a surprise.  We went over and in the span of two days bought a large amount of film and some books and other things.  It turns out that the house belonged to  Stanley C. Livingston, a local photographer that passed away suddenly in the fall of 2010.  I did some looking up of Mr. Livingston and found out that he was a professional photographer of note that was the author of a book titled Blues in Black and White. Unfortunately, Stanley died of a heart attack in 2010, the year the book was published.  I didn't know any of this before I went to the sale, and the walls of the house had many of his photographs from various parts of his career, which spanned the 1970s - 2010.  based upon what we found there, it was obvious that Ann Arbor was a hotbed of photographic creativity in the late 70s to mid-1980s.  There was a quarterly tabloid-sized publication called Photoworks, that Marc found a complete set of at the sale, and I look forward to perusing the pages of those issues.In talking to the folks running the estate sale, I learned that Stanley's extensive and expensive gear had been sold several years ago, but the downstairs and basement was filled with all the types of things any working pro would have acquired over the years -- backdrops, seamless rolls, matting and framing supplies, chemicals, props, darkroom equipment...and film.  I ended up spending about $150 on film - much of it expired, but all refrigerated.   I was pleased to score DX-coded versions of Panatomic-X, as well as Kodak HIE, Konica 720 IR (120) film, tons of Fuji  Reala, Kodak Vericolor II and III, T-max, and Tri-X, as well as many other films in 120 and 35mm and 127! While we were certainly happy to benefit from the film score, it was hard not to wonder about the photographer, and what he was like.  I did a search, and there were many really nice testimonials on a web page where he had an obituary.  He was an Ann arbor townie, and widely respected for his images of the blues and jazz musicians.  He also loved photographing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and had a cottage in the Keweenaw.  He sounded like someone that was a good mentor, and probably was friends with Jeff Lamb who died 2 years ago.   By all accounts Stanley C. Livingston was great guy and photographer, that died too early.So, I will use much of the film that I bought, and am glad that it didn't go into a dumpster.  Those rolls of Panatomic-X are going to be shot by me, thanks to you, Stanley."},
{"title": "Eastman 5363 - Pushing the limits again.", "date": "Saturday, February 15, 2014", "text": "Back in December, I received a surprise package in the mail from the Film Photography Project.  Three rolls of Eastman 5363 b&w to try out.  Now, Mike Rasso must know that I have tried all kinds of crazy b&w films intended for copying, graphics, and other high-contrast applications. But 5363 was a new one for me.   The data sheet states:\"EASTMAN High Contrast Positive Film II 5363 and 7363 is a medium-speed black and-white positive ﬁlm that is suitable for making both positive and negative titles. It is also useful for production of printer effects, such as silhouette and traveling mattes. This blue-sensitive ﬁlm is characterized by high contrast, excellent sharpness, and very high resolving power.\"In other words, \"This is not a film for general photography\" -- or is it?  Part of the problem with using these oddball films is that outside the cine world, we do not see them used much.  If you have Tri-X, why use something like Eastman 5363?  The answer is -- it's the challenge of seeing what happens.  Unfortunately, the data sheet does not give one much hope for other uses, so others have been experimenting with developers and what the native ISO of the film really is. Seeing the term \"medium speed\" baffled me, - compared to what?  Is it ISO 100?  Based on reading what the FPP folks have been doing, I started with ISO 25.  Roll 1 was shot with my Nikkormat EL -- perhaps not the best choice, but it worked.  I compensated for the snow in some shots by shooting manually, in others, I left it in full Aperture Priority. One interesting thing is that this is the first time that I have seen registration holes in addition to the perfs in a film.  Development Notes -- I developed the 5363 in Kodak D76 at 1:1 dilution for 12 minutes, as provided by Mike Rasso's notes.  It could obviously be a shorter development time, but like any of these oddball films, there is much room for experimentation.  I think if one has Technidol LC or Photographer's Formulary TD-3, it would be worth trying out. Based on the negatives from this first attempt, I'll try some less contrasty subjects, and a different developer...perhaps Technidol LC.   Unlike a lot of high-contrast films such as Kodalith, TechPan, High-Contrast Copy film, which are for still cameras, these cine film stocks are always a challenge, because they do not see much use outside their industry.  With the demise of analog titling and effects, they will probably pop up in the market more frequently.  I don't know about 1000 ft rolls, though.  That would be more than a lifetime supply for anyone."},
{"title": "Winter's Glory", "date": "Saturday, February 01, 2014", "text": "Although we have been having one of the snowiest and coldest winters on record in Michigan, it seems silly to complain about it, even though we do.  I think winter is one of those things that defines those of us that descended from Europeans.  We survived the Ice Age.  We will survive winter in the Great Lakes. Of course, our lives are far more complex than those of our ancestors huddled in caves and hide tents during the glacial period, but I suspect that any of them could cope with today's life better than we would if we were suddenly plunked down at the edge of the glaciers. However, they did get to share their back yards with cool megafauna... So, winter offers us opportunities to explore a world that is quite different from what we see the rest of the year.  One can go to the micro world, and explore an individual snowflake.  Shown here is a photomicrograph of a snowflake by Wilson A. Bentley, a Vermont photographer who found that he could attach a camera to his microscope to obtain photos of his favorite subject.1885 Snowflake photo from the Smithsonian Archives.\"In 1885 he successfully photographed the flakes. This photomicrograph and more than five thousand others supported the belief that no two snowflakes are alike, leading scientists to study his work and publish it in numerous scientific articles and magazines. In 1903 Bentley sent prints of his snowflakes to the Smithsonian, hoping they might be of interest to Secretary Samuel P. Langley.\" (quoted from the Smithsonian archive record for Bentley's images).So, in essence, Bentley not only embraced winter, it was the only time that he could do those images. Going back to the old saying \"If life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\"   So, while I may not enjoy the limitations that winter weather gives me - as in bad driving conditions, salt and crud from the streets and roads, and that my heating bill this winter will be a doozy, the snow and ice afford me an opportunity (many, it seems) to do different things than the rest of the year.  I could stay inside, and hang out in my cave, doing studio shots, and still-lifes, or I can go out onto the glacier and see what I can find.Ice Cave in Big Four Glacier, Washington, ca. 1920. Courtesy of Univ. of WashingtonAlthough winter photography is often challenging because of the cold... and cameras and fingers do not always work so well cold, imagine how much harder it was back in the day when people were using view cameras, glass plates, and did not have Gore-tex, Thinsulate, and other modern fabrics to keep warm.While I enjoy shooting black and white in the winter, largely because it is such a monochromatic landscape, color allows for the nuances on the snow that don't show up in monochrome.  I will admit that shooting digital is often easier in cold weather than shooting film, so long as your batteries hold out.  The Li-on batteries in today's DSLRs do quite well in the cold, and keeping a few extras in a warm pocket make shooting pretty easy.  However, if using a film camera, I go for simplicity and easy control - which means the Nikon F2 and FM2N. Winter is also a good time to experiment with high contrast black and white films such as Kodalith, Techpan, and all the other oddball films that are still out there designed for high contrast work.  I know I have posted here previously on using such films, so take a look through my archives.   About the only thing I have not tried in winter is shooting models in the snow.  That seems like a way to torture someone. I know I would not get naked in the snow, so why should I expect someone else to?  However, take a look at Craig Blacklock's \"Lake Superior Nudes\" - some people are just tougher, I guess.  His and her ancestors must have been from the edge of the glacier."},
{"title": "Results from the Autoreflex T", "date": "Monday, January 27, 2014", "text": "I cheated here -- this is not a flipped mirror shot, it was taken with my Nikon 1J1.In the previous post I explained my recent acquisition of a Konica Autoreflex T SLR.  I finally finished off the roll of Arista Premiun 400 and developed it in TMax RS developer.  Just looking at the negatives as they dried, told me that the metering was good - at least good enough.One of the problem with many of these older cameras is that they required 1.35V  Mercury cells for the meters.  Fortunately, I can use Zinc-Air cells in this model without any adapter, and their voltage is plenty close enough. On top of that, some meters lose sensitivity at low EV levels, so while they may function well in daylight, the metering goes to hell in a room. Or, the meter may be non-functional due to corrosion, old solder joints, aged components, etc.  Picking up a camera made in the 1960s and expecting it to work like new seems to be a quality found only with photographers.  Even purely mechanical cameras can have problems caused by old seized lubricants, bad materials used in manufacturing, and things do age.  I know I don't work quite as well as I did 40 years ago.  This particular Autoreflex T seems to work fine, but I still think the metering is a bit suspect indoors.  However, since the shutter speeds are not electronic, I can always shoot in manually, instead of in shutter priority mode.  It certainly has a gratifying solid-sounding shutter and is built very well.I shot some photos while out in the cold winter temperatures that we have been enduring for the past few weeks in Michigan.  Black and white film is great for winter, especially for subjects that have great contrast, such as snow and anything not snow. The icy Huron River, just W of Zeeb Road.On Jan. 18, my friend Cheryl and I checked out the Huron River near Zeeb Road.  There is a nice trail to some nice riffle areas, but i chose to shoot the more placid upstream with its reflections and ice flotsam coming down towards us.It was only about 15°F, but for some reason I cold chilled more quickly than usual, and Cheryl's Nikon FM2N decided it didn't like the cold either.  I had also brought along my Nikkormat EL, and it too, decided to stop working in the cold!Cheryl borrowed my tripod to shoot some scenes with her Nikon FM2N. I am pleased with the images that I got with the 40mm 1.8 lens.  It seems quite sharp, and I look forward to shooting more with it.Is the Autoreflex series a good buy?  Back in the 1960s -1985 or so, there were a lot of different SLR brands.  Some makers, such as Nikon , Minolta, Canon, and Pentax were able to retain their following and incrementally improve their SLR bodies and features.  Konica, Yashica, Olympus, Topcon and Miranda all had some outstanding cameras with great glass.  None of them survived as top SLR makers after 1990.  Well, Yashica did, only because of the Contax contract.  Konica's last SLR was made by Chinon, though the Hexanon lenses were probably made by Konica.  Because the AR-mount lenses are so good, they often command a higher premium with people using them on mirrorless cameras.   If you find a good used Autoreflex T or T3, or even a TC, go for it.  You should be able to pick one up in the $30 and less range. US 23 was closed due to another accident, so the truckers came through town.As I stated above, older cameras with an unknown history may need to be cleaned, calibrated and freshened up with new mirror foam and door seals.  Most of the Autoreflex cameras required Mercury cells, too.  It's up to you whether or not a CLA costing about $70  is worth the trouble for a camera that you paid $25 for.  On the other hand, if the cosmetics are good, the mechanics are sound, and you want a reliable shooter, look into the Konica Autoreflex series.

Fleming Creek has been photographed quite a few times, and this creek always has something to offer. One just has to look.Taken with the Nikon 1J1 with a polarizer, ISO 100.Winter photography has its own challenges, and my favorite film camera for this kind of work is my Nikon F2S.  The controls are easy to work with gloves, making cold weather shooting much easier.  You kmow what though, the Nikon 1J1 is also easy to use with gloves, which was kind of surprising. You can see in this photo that the water has frozen in large sheets, and some of it is flowing on top of the ice, rather than under it.  I shot the 1J1 in monochrome mode, because to me, winter IS monochrome.I used a Tamron 35-135 zoom (in the old Adaptall2  mount), which is an excellent lens.  The Polypan-F was developed in Rodinal 1:25 for 6.5 minutes.  Some of my shots were bracketed, and all looked pretty good.As you can see, I like zooming in on the details, which obscures the scale of the features.  I had a show up on this topic at Matthaei Botanical Gardens in 2012, and I should do another one with the same theme in the near future.One last photo, taken again with the IJ1, which I have to admit does a pretty decent job.  This is Fleming Creek on the N side of Geddes Road near Parker Mill. There was a lot of texture to the ice on the creek.That's it for now.  We have had some serious cold the past week, with temps at -15F on Tuesday.  I hope to get over there early Saturday before it warms up and gets slushy."},

Olympus P&S pocket cameras.From the photo I shot here, the cameras are from rear to front, L and R:Olympus Trip AF (1984) with 35mm f/3.5 with user selectable ISO 100 and 400 setting, thumbwheel film advance.Olympus Infinity AF (1989?)(perhaps the first model)- 35mm f/2.8 Zuiko lens, auto-flash, focus lock, DX-code, self-timer.Olympus Infinity Stylus Epic Zoom 80 Deluxe.

By far, the most compact and most-desired of the mju series. Today, you can pick up any of these cameras and their relatives for next to nothing.  All of them are competent point and shoot cameras, but the fixed focal length  and larger 2.8 aperture and Zuiko-labeled lens of the Infinity AF makes it a good buy.  The best of the lot is still the Infinity Stylus Epic.  If you have the remote control for it (a simple IR remote), this makes it even more versatile.  Used, the cameras still command the price of a really good pizza.  The excellent optics and compact form make it the clear winner. There are some good reviews of these cameras on the web - and I list two here.Stylus and Stylus EpicOlympus Stylus EpicSo, grab one, use DX-coded film cassettes and you are good to go.  Carry one with Kodak Tri-X for b&w and one with your choice of color film.  Great little cameras for wherever you go."},

I told her that the Cortland name was yet another version of the timeless \"Time camera\" and that its value was about that of a McDonald's cheeseburger and fries, and that she should send it to me when she had the chance. Well, yesterday, the annual Christmas package arrived, and in the box was the Cortland CX-7.  It was heavy, and after I opened up the box and removed the plastic wrapping from the camera, I took off the bottom plate and yes, there is a pot-metal weight there, as well as weights either on the lens barrel or behind the front grip area.  I put it back together, and marveled at the attempt to make a cheap plastic toy camera look and feel like a more expensive SLR. The manual was also printed in 4 languages, making it much thicker than it ought to be.  The Cortland Optical lens?  Just like all the other \"optical lenses\" in this type of camera.  There is a somewhat adjustable aperture, and the shutter speed is about 1/125 sec.  There was an offer inside the box for a matching flash for $17 + $3 shipping. I have had many of these cameras over the years end up at my door, and all are variants on the same basic specifications.the Original TIME cameraThe Sceptre 800The great Photoflex MX-35None of them would be called a good camera, and I believe that even the most basic Kodak Instamatics took better quality photos.  However, one never knows the results until a roll of film is put through one.  I'll slap a roll of b&w into the Cortland and see what results I get.    They do accept a manual flash unit, so they can be used indoors.   The actual value?  While there are those on ebay that might describe these types of cameras as something else, these are cheap plastic toy cameras.  Perhaps slightly better than a Holga 35. They are not worth much, but if you find one at a thrift shop for a buck, buy it and have fun.  I do have results on this blog for another variant, the CMYK camera.  Your results may vary, just as mine did."},
{"title": "Busy in the Waning Days of November", "date": "Saturday, November 30, 2013", "text": "For some reason, I have not posted anything in a month on this blog.  I blame it on the time of year.  It's not that I haven't been shooting, because I sure have.  I have some posts in progress, but I haven't developed the film yet, or I have the film scanned, but haven't written the article.  However, I think my biggest excuse is that I have been busy getting work ready for two exhibits, as well as finishing some printing and, matting, and framing for some sold pieces and for gifts.  I don't know about others, but getting ready for a show is for me, an emotionally draining experience.  I do all my matting and framing, and while not exactly rocket science, it does require care and planning and proper technique for a good result.  One show I am in (which I will post details on at the end) has six other photographers, and I have 7 images in that show, which is appropriately called \"Seven Views.\"   My color prints are done by MPix, which are the largest prints so far that I have done for an exhibit - 12 x 12 and 12 x 18 inches. All frames are 18 x 24 inches.  My dry mount tissue is 11 x 14\" so I had to carefully use two pieces under each image.  I have hundreds of sheets of 16x20 dry mount tissue, but it is not for RC color prints.  I ordered 7 18x24 frames from Dick Blick, which arrived quickly in perfect condition, and in fact, it was several weeks after I first received them that I used them.  They came 3/box and one single frame done separately.  That single frame turned out to not be 18x24, but 20x24!  A good thing I had something hanging in the house in the same frame style and in 18x24.  Of course, this was all less than a week before the show opened.   I also had to buy more mat board from Dick Blick.  I have to say, that it was well-packed, and I am really impressed by the care the company takes to make sure the customer is satisfied. The second exhibit, in which I have two pieces, was a lot simpler, except that my frame size was 14 x 18, so I had to get some glass cut for the frames.  Why 14x18\" ? Well, with a 3\" mat border for an 8x12\" print (I am one of those people that fill the frame to the edge), that makes 14x18\", if you want a uniform border.  This also means that most pre-made frames are out, as most of those are 16x20 - which is an awful lot of white space for an 8x12 print. Trust me on this, I have done a lot of those.What about the exhibits?  The Seven Views opening was wonderful.  Raymond James and Associates is an investment firm in Ann Arbor that sponsors a rotating artists' series, and the show is on the walls inside their building.  Mike Myers coordinated our show and herded the cats, and it all came together Friday, 11/22. At least 130 people attended the opening of the show, and our hosts put on a great feed with catering from Jefferson Market.    Lots of great comments and interest in my work, and in the work by the 6 other photographers.  I didn't sell anything the first night, but it is up until the end of February, so hope springs eternal.  There were 5 sales that first night, though, which I think is pretty good.The second exhibit is a little different - 50 Shades of Green at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which opened just before Thanksgiving.  I have two photographs in the hanging art part of the exhibit, which of course features displays in the Conservatory, which has green growing things -- something to enjoy this time of year!Green 1 and Green 2.I have a pet peeve about shows featuring natural history subjects, and get ready for a short rant.  If you, the photographer (painter, etc) put a name on a description of the animal or plant (or other object) in your work. Make sure it is correct.  Calling  Switch Grass a Bluestem may not seem like a big deal, but it's no different than calling a vulture an eagle, or a butterfly a moth, etc.  Your audience is by large, going to be more discerning of such things than a more general population at a different venue.

The compact design and solid feel of this camera has made it a joy to use.  It is quirky, for sure. but once one gets  used to the controls, it's a no-brainer to use. Back in August/September, I put in a roll of the Kodak Hawkeye Surveillance Film -a  C-41 color film that looks like a 400 ISO Ektar.  I took a few shots around town, and even used the flash once at a meeting of the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club.  All the exposures came out great.  That film is really something, and worth trying out.  You can get individual rolls from the Film Photography project store.T Paul at the A3C3 meeting, back in September.  The hotshoe is on the bottom of the camera, so you need to hold it upside down for a more appropriate flash position.

{"title": "Finding Your Photographic Voice", "date": "Thursday, October 17, 2013", "text": "Back in 1999, when I started to really get back into photography, I was quite intent on doing macro-photography.  I read a lot of books and manuals and found the books written by John Shaw to be very helpful.  I fell into a trap though.  You see, I confused technique with style and with the \"eye\" that one develops with experience.  I wanted to shoot photos like John Shaw.  Yes, I got very good at doing macro and nature closeups, but I was essentially trying to produce images like those of Shaw.    I eventually got over that and started reading more about general photography, the history of the medium, and so on.   Being very good at something technically does not equal artistic success or photographs with emotion. I see people ask questions like \"how do I get the look that (insert name here) gets with his images\"? Or \"Does anyone know how this photographer achieved this look?\"   Of course, those are valid questions about techniques and materials (supposing that was on film), but usually the posers of the question want to shoot images just like the ones they are seeing. They are confusing technique with ability; methods with seeing. My usual response to such questions is to tell the person to (a) ask the photographer, and (b) read as many photographic books as you can, go to galleries, and shoot, shoot, shoot, and shoot, some more. I understand why anyone would want to emulate something that they like.  However, the thing a photographer should be doing is asking herself (or himself) why is she doing this?  Why do you photograph anything?  There are more answers to that question than I have patience for on the keyboard, but a glib one would be \"because painting takes too damn long.\"  It has taken me many years to figure out that I have a style, or voice, if you will.  I have my standard-bearers -- Walker Evans, Edward Weston, David Plowden, Paul Caponigro, Stephen Shore, and others -- photographers whose work I admire and appreciate greatly.  I don't ask \"how did they get that shot? or what film they were using.  That is unimportant to me -- what matters is -- what were they trying to say, and what effect does that image have, what message does it convey?  This may be the hardest concept to grasp for a beginner.  One may as well ask what paper Mozart wrote his operas on.  What inspired Mozart (who was a musical genius) to write them, and what did they mean to him?  What effect does the music have on you?  Did it affect others the same way at the time he wrote it?  While viewing a photograph, what does it mean to you?  What did it mean to the photographer? Are there elements to it that when scrutinized, give the image more meaning?  What do you see?I was reminded about how people look at images last night while watching the movie Smoke.  Harvey Kietel's character (Auggie) has been photographing the same street corner in New York at the same time every day, and has hundreds of images in albums.  William Hurt's character (Paul Benjamin) is flipping through the pages and tells  Auggie that they are all the same. Auggie tells him that he's not really looking. Every one is different, just the location is the same.  Finally, Paul finds an image on the corner with his deceased wife in the frame, and breaks down.  It was a great scene, and I think shows part of what photography is about.  Auggie shoots the way he does because it means something to him.  Because the street corner  is shot the same way, same time, every day, there is an absolute honesty to the images.  The only thing that changes is whatever happens to be passing by, the weather, and the light.   Each image has its own story, if we look and actually see what is there.So, back to the beginning of this lengthy post.  How do you develop your own voice, your own vision?  It takes time, and it may change over the years.  We are all influenced by our mentors, favorite photographers, the media, our choice of materials, etc.  Shoot every day, or at least try to.  Find out what subjects or situations attract you the most.  Experiment with different techniques and lenses.  Maybe you  will find that a pinhole camera is what you were destined to work with. Maybe not. Try it, anyway. Read. Go out and shoot with a goal in mind.  Go to photo exhibits at museums and be inspired.  Pick up a copy of Lenswork magazine and be inspired.  Don't confuse gear and technique with the final image.  Some of the best images have been taken with fairly simple equipment.  It was a matter of the photographer seeing the image.  If you are using a digital camera, it costs nothing to shoot. However, it will take time to go through the images, so think about what you are doing...slow down.Lastly, I want to plug a book that I found to be very interesting.  It's perhaps the shortest book on photography that I have read, and it took me a while to read it and digest it in small chunks.  Why Photography Matters by Jerry L. Thompson, 2013, MIT Press.  92 pages that are worthy of attention.Other books that deserve mention:Ways of Seeing by John BergerTao of Photography - Seeing Beyond Seeing by Philippe L. Gross and S.I.

From the tenements in New York City to the coalmines of Pennsylvania, and the fabric mills in the South, people were left with no social net, no healthcare, no schools, low pay, child labor, and more.  Hine helped raise awareness of the plight of those people through the use of his camera. It should not be underestimated how bad conditions were at that time.  Striking mine workers and their families were shot by National Guardsmen in Colorado (by order of the Governor) in the late 1800s.  People in New York tenements were dying of diseases caused by overcrowding and lack of sanitation. Girls were working 14 hour days with a few minutes off for a meal.  Ultimately, public opinion was swayed by popular articles and photography, as well as by marches and strikes for better pay and a decent workweek.  The good old days were only good if you had money and social status. The job isn't finished yet, as GOP Congressmen and certain right-wing groups demonize unions, demonize the poor, deny a living wage, healthcare and more, while the ultra rich get ever more rewards.  This is not too different from what happened a  hundred years ago.  We should learn from history, and yet we don't."},
{"title": "Polaroid Joy", "date": "Thursday, September 05, 2013", "text": "Last weekend, Adrienne and I made a trip back to Amenia, NY to visit her family, and to photograph the family cottage on Twin Lakes, CT which was about to be sold.  I brought my Nikon D90, Nikon F3HP, Hasselblad 500C, Nikon 1J1, and my Polaroid 250.  While I spent a lot of time documenting the cottage with my D90, I used the Polaroid quite a bit with the people.  Now, in case you have forgotten, the Polaroid 250 Land Camera is a bellows camera with a nice rangefinder focus, and takes the traditional Polaroid pack film for 3 1/4\" x 4 1/4\" prints.  Wait! Didn't Polaroid stop selling film? Yes.  But Fuji makes color and black and white pack film for these cameras.  It's Fuji FP100C and FP3000B films that work with the old Polaroid pack film cameras. As soon as I pulled out the 250, I got all kinds of comments, from \"Is that an old Polaroid?\"; \"That camera must be really old!\"; \"I used to have one of those.\"; to \"Can you still get film?\"  Even better though, was the immediacy of the results and people's appreciation on seeing something they could physically handle.  To me, that is one of the great things about Polaroid images.  They are nearly immediate, and TANGIBLE.  Not some file sitting on a smart phone that's hard to show off, not a file on a hard drive, but a thing - an object - which obviously has substance and value, and can sit on the shelf or on the fridge, or in an album, as a reminder of an event, a person's love, or a place.  There is only that ONE image, and you have it.  (Well, of course, they can now be scanned in, etc., but not if I gave one away.)  I shot 3 packs of the color film, and gave some of the prints to people, and kept the rest to share electronically.   The people that received prints were so appreciative.  That's one of the underestimated things about photography.  The power to capture a moment is one thing, but to hold that moment in your hand as a 2D representation, unchanging, independent of any other device, is one of the reasons photography became so popular. Especially since a drawing takes way too long.It used to be that people shot Polaroids all the time, and they were a regular part of parties, gatherings, etc.  Today, everyone uses their cell phones.  Oh, you can go to the Internet to see the photos, etc., but having a print of your very own is a more precious thing. I like the palette of the Fuji color pack film.  It's colorful, and self-limiting -- you don't have to worry about leaving the positive/negative together for too long.  I hope Fuji keeps producing it for quite a while, as this 250 still has a lot of life left in it.A few examples from the weekend: Nick and his dad, Bill, looking over at a Polaroid I had taken of the two of them just minutes before.  Bill carefully took it back to his truck so as not to lose it . Blue doors at an old building in Millerton, NY.  The Murphy clan - all the children of Charlotte (87) and Jim (deceased) Murphy.Top row - Brian, Andy, Charlotte (my mother-in-law)Middle - Cathleen, Adrienne (my wife), ElizabethBottom: Bob, Larry. Larry and Bob share a story. The Amenia Library.  Amenia is in Dutchess County, NY - a largely rural and hilly part of the state.  It took a while to get used to driving there, compared to the flatness of Michigan.Amenia Burial Ground - a cemetery that is populated by graves from the late 1700s to mid 1800s.

{"title": "The Nikon 1 is a good tool to have in your toolbox", "date": "Sunday, August 25, 2013", "text": "I am serious about this.  Like a lot of  Nikon users, I initially derided the Nikon 1 system as a marketing gimmick - small sensor (when we were clamoring for FX sensors, they gave us what?); no viewfinder (well the IV1 does have an EVF); different colors?, etc.  Now, I won't claim that my 1 J1 is perfect -- the dial is fiddly, and we don't need the red button, etc.  However, I have gotten used to the menus and controls, and I am very pleased -- sometimes astonished -- at the results from this little camera.  I agree with Thom Hogan that the camera was marketed poorly -- and to the wrong group.  Instead of Pros carrying an iPhone,  a Nikon 1 with a 10 mm lens (= 27 mm in 35 mm format) will give you some really great images.  This system should have been designed and targeted for those of us that love photography, but carrying something smaller, lighter, and more robust than a P&S with a tiny sensor would be a good thing.  There are numerous complaints online about the faults of the Nikon 1 system, but few complain about the images from the cameras.  Lately, I have been carrying my 1J1 in my camera bag along with whatever film cameras I have that day.  Slapping a polarizer on the lens has given me some of the most dramatic shots I have taken, and cropping the shots to square format afterwards has not detracted from the results.  A few examples:Today, at Cranbrook --Yesterday in Dexter:At the Brett Weston Exhibit in Ann Arbor:At the Rolling Sculpture car show in July:In Chicago:I'm not saying the Nikon 1 system is the only tool you need, but with a 10mm, 18.5mm, 10-30mm lens set, it will do a lot of shooting quite well, and like any camera, the more you use it, the more comfortable you get with  it.    I picked mine up as a refurb from Nikon, and it has been a very good tool to have. Go online and buy a set of 40.5mm filters for yours if you haven't done that yet.  I also have a 40.5 to 49mm adapter so I can use close-up lenses and other filters."},
{"title": "Expired Film...Kodak Royal Gold 1000", "date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2013", "text": "A few weeks ago, I picked up a bunch of film and a camera, the Canon Z115 for five dollars.  One of the rolls of film turned out to be Kodak Royal Gold 1000, one of the faster C-41 films that Kodak pushed out the door -- which I wonder if it was later called Kodak Max 800.  Seeing that the film expiration date was 1998, I rated the film at ISO 400 and shot it in my beautiful Nikon F3HP around town and in Dexter.  It was only 24 exposures, which can be somewhat infuriating when you want to try out something special.  Anyhow, I finished the roll up on Saturday in Dexter and dropped it off at Huron Camera.  I stopped by this afternoon to pick up my CD and the negatives.  Overall, I am pleased with the results in that my estimation of ISO 400 was pretty close, though in the scans one can see the shadows blocked up.  It's grainy, which is to be expected for a high-speed expired film, but the grain looks interesting in some of the shots.Krazy Jim's Blimpy Burger's last day was the day before I shot this.  It's located in a block of houses that UM has purchased and will be razed to make way for a graduate student dorm. While the closing has gained a lot of press and brought thousands here for a last burger, I am ambivalent.  It's the kind of place that people should eat at sparingly if they value their arteries... Last year, Lena replaced the Parthenon Restaurant which had been at the corner for at least as long as I have lived in Ann Arbor - 32 years.  I like the old facade and the color scheme they chose.  Lest anyone think things don't change, the building was a drug store back in the 1950s. I just can't resist shooting bees on sunflowers. What can I say? George Borel in Dexter.  He's behind the counter at Huron Camera and is a very knowledgeable photographer and a good person to know. You can see the shadows blocking up in the expired film.  The highlights look pretty decent, though.The Beer Depot is another iconic place in downtown Ann Arbor.  The neon sign fell over a couple of years ago, and the store owners were able to convince City Hall that the sign could be replaced.  It does look pretty good, though I confess I have to see it at night.Most of the shots on the roll were decent, and these are just samples from the roll.    People ask me why anyone would want to shoot expired film.  It's partly a challenge to see what I can coax from those old films, and a gamble, as one never knows how these films were stored. I'm not into trying to prematurely age films by subjecting them to high heat, etc.  I'd rather wait until something comes my way and see what happens.  A rule of thumb is to reduce the operating ISO by one stop for each decade, and the faster the film, the more sensitivity it loses over time. I'd say my guess of ISO 400 worked pretty well here."},
{"title": "A Premium Point and Shoot - Canon Sure Shot Z115", "date": "Sunday, August 18, 2013", "text": "A few weeks ago I purchased a a camera with a box of film, etc. for $5 at the Recycle/Reuse store in Ann Arbor.  Mostly, I bought it for the film, but once I got the Sure Shot Z115 home, I realized it was a top-notch P&S in its day.  That day would have been 1993, and the 35mm P&S cameras were abundant. The Z-115 features a 38-115mm zoom, with a maximum aperture of f/3.6 and f/8.5 at each end of the range.  It features 7 camera modes, a precision AF system, auto-DX film setting, various flash modes, and a silent winding function.  I inserted 2 CR-123 cells into the camera, and it sprung to life.  The camera had been kept in a case, and it was free of dirt, etc., and ready to use.  As a P&S camera, this one is quite feature-rich, and well-made.  The front shell is aluminum, not plastic, and it fits in the hand very well with easy to use controls.  I put in a roll of expired Kodak B&W C-41, and took the camera to work one day and shot the roll during my lunch hour.  I mostly shot over near the medical campus and on the way back to my office.  One nice thing about the camera -- is zooms very well, covering the typical range one might use in most situations.  It's quiet in operation as well. The photos all came out well, even factoring in the expired film.  As far as automatic 35mm P&S cameras go the Canon Sure Shot Z-115 is certainly a desirable model."},

An Argus 75 is quite common, but it takes 620 film, not the 120 spools. However, if you want to use 620, the FPP store has it in stock!  I would stay away from the Autronic models as most of them have not fared well over the years.  A C-3 or C-4 will allow you to use 35mm film, and will give pretty good results."},
{"title": "About town with a Rollei 35TE", "date": "Monday, July 29, 2013", "text": "My good friend and mentor Bill Brudon invited over to his place ten years ago, and asked me to pick from two Rollei 35 cameras that he had. I chose the later one made in Singapore, a 35TE, figuring he wanted the German-made model.  Bill was always giving me cameras, and I still miss having our occasional chats about photography and stories about his career.  He may have passed on, but I keep using the gear that he gave me. The Rollei 35TE is a compact metal-bodied 35mm camera from Rollei.  It features a collapsible lens tube, leaf shutter with speeds from B- 1/500 sec, a high-albada brightline viewfinder, a 40mm f3.5 Tessar lens, metering with indicator LEDs, a hotshoe (on the bottom), and threaded cable release and tripod socket. Mike Elek has a good page on the web about it. The 35TE model was made from 1979 to 1981. It takes a 5.6V mercury battery, which I happen to have several of.   It's a great camera to carry along, and if you don't mind using the zone focus guestimation, it is a pretty decent street camera due to its small size.  It fits into most trouser pockets as well. I hadn't used mine in several years, so I took out out a few weeks ago and shot a roll of Polypan-F with it.  I walked around the Ann Arbor Art Fair for a bit and shot most of the roll there.  In use, it's easy to prefocus at the hyperfocal distance for f/11or f/16, and just point and shoot of you have the shutter speed set already.    On a sunny day, it's easy.  Everything about this camera seems well-made, and it is fun to carry around with a wrist strap to keep it ready for action."},
{"title": "The Plastic but Practical Pentax P30T", "date": "Saturday, July 27, 2013", "text": "Last week I picked up a Pentax P30T on the big auction site. It came with a Pentax K1000, an old (but nice) Pentax Takumar 135 f/3.5, a flash, and some other accessories for a Nikon.  As a bunch of stuff goes, I felt that the $14.00+ shipping was a decent deal.  I had gotten rid of ALL my K-mount gear last year, but every now and then I make an impulse buy.  This particular P30T has seen some use, but it appears to work just fine. I know how some people bemoan the onslaught of polycarbonate-bodied cameras, but unless seriously abused, they hold up pretty well.  The Pentax P30T was sold from 1990-97, and is a manual focus, manual advance 35mm SLR.  I like the clean lines and unobtrusive controls on the top deck of the body.  As far as inexpensive SLRs go, this model features Aperture-priority and metered Manual control, a self-timer, depth-of-field preview, remote shutter port, DX film speed detection, metering lock, hotshoe, and shutter speeds from B, 1-1/1000 sec with flash sync at 1/100 sec.  The only big minus appears to be the lack of manually setting the ISO, and if you use a cassette without the DX code, the default ISO is 100.  Oh, and exposure compensation would also be nice, too.  However, given the market that the P30T aimed it, most of those users probably didn't miss those features.  The camera came with a SMC Pentax-A 50mm f/2.0 lens.  As you can see from the photos, the camera does have a nice clean design with a bit of a grip.  Because there are few protruding controls, I'd give it high marks for being easily carried around.  The eyepiece viewing is adequate, and the focus screen has a diagonally aligned central focus spot.  The metering readings in the viewfinder are easy to see, and when not in A mode, an M shows up. Shooting with the camera was comfortable, and the lightweight body is easily carried and handled.  The film advance lever moves smoothly and has a relatively short travel distance.The film reminder window allows you to see what film you have loaded, which is handy for those of us that use so many cameras and films, that it is easy to forget what is in the camera.Overall, this camera has a lot of pluses, and just a couple of minuses. Of course, I did not pay much for it, either. However, it is a more capable camera that a Nikon EM, and more similar in the feature set to the much earlier Nikon FE. I shot a roll of somewhat expired Kodak Gold 100, and the film was developed and scanned at Huron Camera in Dexter.  The first two shots of flowers were taken with a \"Pro Optic\" 70-300 K-mount lens that I picked up at Recycle/Reuse for $5. The rest of the photos were taken with the 50mm f/2 lens that came with the camera.This camera certainly is a sturdy and reliable compact SLR, regardless of the plastic body.  While maybe not in the classic status of the Pentax ME or ME Super, it still is worth considering.line of sightLunch breakUM Power CenterThe beautiful Kerrytown Concert HouseVenus on the sidewalk"},

The first trip to Drummond Island and back allowed me to do some shooting along the N shore of Lake Huron in Chippewa County.  In many places, limestone boulders jut out of the sand, and in others, rocky outcrops with sandy infills are part of the shore.  Luckily, some of the more interesting spots are accessible from the road.  All of the shots shown here were taken at the shore near the rest stop on M-134 W of Detour State Forest Campground.  I had not even looked at these images on the computer until this evening, so I was really pleased with what I captured from the beach.I really had a blast with the D90 set to b&w mode, as I wanted to capture the forms, textures, and abstract quality of the rocks along the shore.  Sometimes the rocks looked like some kind of ancient ruins, crumbling back into the earth, while others looked like fossil creatures.  I could have easily spent hours there, but we were on our way home.  The light was soft, and that avoided harsh shadows, which really aided in showing texture.I'd like to visit again, and camp at the State Forest Campground, which looked great for rustic camping.  Of course, I'd also like to shoot the rocks on film, too.   This last photograph was taken in color, and the orange lichen gives the illusion that it is a false-color photo.  Isn't nature grand?"},

Since I paid only a buck fior the lens, I had nothing to lose.  The Domiplan aperture control ring is on the very front of the lens...like an Argus Cintar.  It's also automatic aperture control only, so the aperture pin need to be engaged for stop-down metering, depth of field examination, etc.  Not necessarily the easiest lens to use, but I got around fine with it when I was a teenager.I attached the Dompilan to my Mamiya 1000DTL M-42 camera.  To make it easier to adjust the aperture AND use a light shade, I attached an old 49mm metal lens shade and it works perfectly. It's not a fast lens with a maximum aperture of f/2.8, but it will do.  I loaded up a roll of Eastman Kodak Hwakeye 400 ISO color film and shot away with it while I was on Drummond Island back in mid-June. The results were fine, and this cheap lens certainly did the job.Comparing the two lenses - one on the Exa 1a, and the other on the Mamiya, the only difference is the shutter control button on the Exakta-mount lens. This is not the Exa 1a that I was given in 1973.  That one was sold long ago after I got seriously back into photography.  This one is a display model that I picked up cheaply on eBay.  I have no desire to go back to shooting with a crappy-waist-level 35mm viewfinder...Sunset on Drummond Island with Ultrafine 125 BW filmAn unusual triangular building at Point Detour.

You can see many of the old places along US-2 that have survived from the late 1950s-early 60s.  That is another project someday-- before its too late-- to document the tourist-oriented business along US-2 between St. Ignace and Manistique.Marc and I had the opportunity to photograph the Mackinac Bridge from several vantage points NW and SW of the bridge, and I have already photographed it numerous times from the NE and SE side.  This time though, we had the added attraction of some foggy weather over the straits, and it resulted in some different shots for me.It seems that cellphones have replaced point and shoots for most people.  Nikon N2000 with 35mm f/2 lens. That 35 has become my carry-around lens now.I haven't been using my Pentax 6x7 as much as I should be, but when I do, I am almost always pleased with my results.  This was taken with Ilford XP-2 film. I probably had at least one filter on the lens -- a red filter.Taken with my Nikon FM2N, 50mm 1.4 lens, on Arista 100 film.  Funny thing is that I brought the FM2N as a backup to my N2000 and N90s.  I finished up the roll that was on it, which turned out to be the trip from December 31 that Marc and I took along the Raisin River!  Maybe I have too many cameras...Taken from the NW side of the bridge which gives a pretty good viewpoint. A tern was hunting in front of me and kept diving into the lake to catch fish. You can see it on the left side of the photo.  This was Fuji 400 ISO color film, arguably not the best choice for this subject.  A finer-grained film such as Kodak Ektar would be a better choice.Film drying.  I shot quite a bit of Polypan-F on the trip, and am really pleased with the negatives I got from it.  I'll have another entry about shooting at Fayette State Park, which I highly recommend as a photo destination!"},
{"title": "The Mark and Marc trip to Photostock 2013...and beyond.", "date": "Friday, June 28, 2013", "text": "Bill Schwab has been hosting an annual gathering of film photographers in Northern Michigan near Harbor Springs for the past 7 years or so.  The gathering, Photostock ( a photographic Woodstock of sorts), originally took place in the woods at Bill's site SE of Cross Village. It became necessary to move most of the events to the Birchwood Inn N of Harbor Springs as the event became more multifaceted and the crowds grew. This year, part of the event was a christening of Bill's newly-built workshop building that was launched with funding from Kickstarter.  About 70 people showed up throughout the 3-day affair and like any annual event, it becomes a time to renew acquaintances and make new friends. Getting ready to make the trip, I assembled my photographic gear...a few cameras (not shown are the additional lenses, tripods, etc., that also went).My good friend Marc Akemann and I drove up to attend Photostock 2013 last Thursday, and along the way did what photographers do -- eat and shoot photos.  We drove up M-52 to Owosso aand then went W until we hit US-127 and took that to I-75 and then to Mackinaw City where we stayed for the thee nights of Photostock, as we did not make our plans early enough to get a room at the Birchwood Inn.   However, it all worked out pretty well, and we had a great time seeing everyone and talking about photography.  It's always a very good-natured crowd, and I always come away with having learned something new, and new contacts.Marc and I did some night shooting, too, as we were able to get some images of the Mackinac Bridge at night in the fog.  Morning fog was pretty good, too, but the coffee quickly took care of that :). Oh, and the fog over the water was nice, as well. Mighty Mac at NightMighty Mac in fog.I shot extensively with my N90s abd N2000 cameras, my Rolleiflex, the Debonair, and my Olympus Pen E-PL1 (which accounts for most of the digital images here).  I have 19 rolls of film to process, so these digi shots will have to suffice for now.  Having said that, the CCTV lens on my Olympus Pen really gave me a look that I like, especially at Fayette State Park.  I am posting a few shots of our Photostock trip here, but it's easier to go to the set on Flickr for all of them. Checking out Jamie Young's amazing prints from his panoramic cameras.  They really are quite spectacular. Jamie gave an engrossing presentation on the history of panoramic photography Friday night at the Birchwood Inn.Marc (L) and Mark (R) at Wilderness State Park.  I was amazed to find that my cheap smartphone had a self-timer for the camera.  We spent a lot of time in Emmet County, and then went across the bridge to the UP for the second part of our trip.  I think that we put over 1,000 miles on the vehicle for this trip. One highlight was seeing my daughter and her partner Stephanie in Marquette.  A visit there isn't complete without a few photographs from Presque Isle, and I know Marc really enjoyed being there at sunset.  I could shoot there every week and come away with something different each time.The Black Rocks at Presque Isle are especially worthy of a few hours (days?) of a photographer's time.  Maybe that would be a good destination for a photo workshop in the future.

{"title": "Testing the Kodak Hawkeye Traffic Surveillance Color  Film", "date": "Monday, May 27, 2013", "text": "While I was at the FPP Findlay Walking Workshop in mid-April, there was some talk about some film on ebay.  It turns out that a seller had lots of 100 ft rolls of Kodak Hawkeye Traffic Surveillance Film - a 400 ISO C-41 color emulsion.  There was a \"buy it now\" for less than $30, so I bit.  I am amazed at the oddball films that show up on ebay, and have to wonder how many \"custom\" films were sold for specialized uses.The film arrived quickly, and I finally spooled some up into cassettes.  I have only done bulk b&w film before this (and that's been a LOT of bulk rolls), so it was no problem with this film.  I put a roll into my Nikon F2S, and shot a bunch of things close to home and in the garden.  Note to the readers -- NEVER take an untested film out to shoot something you can't do over again.  I learned that the hard way many years ago.Anyhow, there is some literature on this film, and some folks on Flickr claim they have pushed it to ISO 1600 with good, if not grainy results.  I myself wonder if it isn't just a variant of  Portra 400.  As promised, here are some images straight from the scans from Huron Camera without any adjustment on my part.I think that the color rendition is good, and look forward to shooting more of it.  I have a C-41 kit that I have yet to try, so perhaps this will be a good opportunity to see what develops :). The film seems a bit grainy, but that may be due to the scans on the Fuji lab equipment.  I'll try scanning on my Minolta scanner and see if there is any difference.  In any case, it is an inexpensive roll of bulk film that will be put to use."},

This proved to be an excellent choice.  I mostly shot in b&w, and the camera did an excellent job with the tonality.  Weighing very little, it was great to carry around, and the 10mm lens allowed me to crop images to square format.    Here are few shots from the trip.

{"title": "The Holga Lens for Olympus and other Micro-4/3 cameras.", "date": "Saturday, May 11, 2013", "text": "Over the many years I have been a photographer, some of my most memorable shots have been with the original Holga 120N.  It's not hard to see why -- for such an inexpensive camera one can have a lot of fun shooting and figuring out what the camera can do.  It is still a bargain compared to the Lomo Diana F+, and the results are still as unique as ever.  However, many folks have left film cameras and want to recreate the Holga \"look\" on a digital camera.  China has responded by producing Holga lenses for Nikon, Canon, and Pentax mount cameras.  I have used the 60mm Holga lens in my Nikon D90 and in my Nikon film SLRs, and wasn't too enamored with it as the viewfinder image was very dim.  The aperture was listed as f/8, but I think it was even smaller than that, negating some of the very characteristics that make the plastic lenses so fun to use.  I am always on the lookout for fun lenses to use with my Olympus Pen E-PL1, and I saw that Holga was selling a version of the lens for the Micro 4/3 mount.  The 25mm focal length was a perfect \"normal\" lens aspect for the M4/3 mount, too.  So, I ordered a lens from Holga Direct and it arrived about a week later.  For less than $20, too, direct from Hong Kong.  Yes, the lens is ALL plastic, but that's the \"Holga way.\"  That is the lens on my E-PL1, and yes that is the Olympus VF-3 viewfinder on top of the camera (perhaps the best $100 I have spent to make a camera more useful).  The Holga lens has the typical pictograms on the lens barrel for closeup, portrait, group, and infinity.  The rear of the lens has a central aperture surrounded by a ring of smaller holes.  I believe this gives the lens a better \"Holga quality\" by softening the image on a digital sensor.    The lens comes with front and rear lens caps (throw them away).  Use a M4/3 rear cap for the lens to keep out dust and grime when not on the camera.   In use, the lens barrel rotates smoothly to \"focus.\"  This is where the optional eye-level EVF comes in handy, as it is really much easier to find the focus than on the rear LCD.  However, using the magnify button allows one to also gauge the focus pretty well.  The Holga lens vignettes nicely, and the images definitely have that \"Holga look\"...on digital.  Using the Art Filter settings AND the Holga lens on the Olympus also gives me even MORE creative possibilities.  The close-up setting is about 2 feet away from the subject, which is a nice touch with this lens.  The Holga M4/3 lens is a definite must-have if you like a little blur with your images. Here are a few samples.  The lens does best in contrasty situations - i.e., full sun.  Set your ISO to 400, and you will be good in full sun to partly cloudy conditionS.  I use the 1:1 setting for square format Holga-like results, and have been quite happy with it. My final verdict -- this is the best Holga lens for non-Holga cameras that I have used.  The ability to choose a square aspect ratio with the Pen really makes the most of this lens, and while the results are digital, the experience is much like using a Holga.  Ditch those Instagram fakeries, and use a real lens to get the Holga experience."},
{"title": "World Wide Pinhole Photography Day", "date": "Sunday, April 28, 2013", "text": "WWPPD has become quite a big thing. Each year, hundreds (thousands?) of photographers shoot pinhole cameras on the last Sunday of April. Each person uploads a single image to the WWPPD web site, and it is a blast to see what other folks have been shooting.  This year, I had plans to spend a good chunk of the day doing pinhole shots.  However, the weather turned out to be overcast and drizzly all day.  Not the best weather for doing any kind of shooting, unless you are under an umbrella.  However, I was determined to shoot something besides an indoor still-life.  I loaded up my Polaroid pinhole camera -- it uses pack film, and is a former Tektronix oscilliscope camera.  I think I made it about 8 years ago, and removed the front part of the camera and replaced it with a new front and a pinhole.  Simple.  I am on the third pinhole iteration, and the current size is about right.   The film I used this time around is the Fuji 3000B - the 3000 ISO black and white film.  For a day like today, it was at the edge of the usable range, being that my exposures were between 2 and 3 seconds.  I could not have used it in full sun.  Certainly a good choice for indoor pinholery, though.I managed to do some test shots outside the house to gauge my exposure, and then headed over to Parker Mill, hoping for some images of the flowing water at Fleming Creek.  Between the time I did the test shots and got on the road, it had started raining as a fine mist.  I soldiered on, hoping for the best.  Fleming Creek was actually flowing quite well, and the small island I often shoot from was surrouned by the creek.  I was able to hop over the overflow, and set up on the island.  The ground beneath the trees had been scoured by the high water of the previous week, and looked pretty interesting.  I was able to finish off the pack of film, but with the rain, my prints got wet, and though I had them in a box, some emulsion still got scraped while being jostled on the way back to the car.  So, if you shoot in the rain with pack film, carry a dry box to keep the prints in.    Here are a few shots from the day."},

It rotates to the left, revealing the lens and  allowing use of the camera.   It uses 2 AA batteries to power the auto-winder and pop-up flash.  Film is easy to load- simply release the back catch, and the back opens up from the bottom, and you simply slide the roll of film and leader into place.  Shut the back and the film loads to frame 1.  There are only two manually-set ISO settings - 100 and 400.  Not the best selection, but this isn't a camera for the picky.  The two film speeds are also ones most likely to be found at the drugstore back in 1983, when the camera was released.    There is a pop-up flash that is manually set.  The focus is zone, with icons for portrait, group, and landscape.  The default is group, which is also the flash setting. The shutter button is large and easily found, and next to it there is also a recessed connector for a standard remote release cable, as well as a tripod socket on the bottom of the camera.  This is a pretty basic, yet functional and sturdy camera.  It can fit easily into a big pocket.top deck of cameraThe camera specifications are:38mm focal length, f/4 Fujinon lens1/100 sec shutter speed at ISO 1001/300 sec shutter speed at ISO 400. dimensions - 121 x 72 x 55 mm; 300 gAnticipating today's trends, the camera was available in black, white, and red!

Snowstorm in Dexter, second shot on the roll.Jiffy in ChelseaMarch reflectionnot yet picnic timecactus clubmonstera leavesThe optics appear to be quite sharp. It's not a bad camera, and surely a sturdy camera to keep handy for any adventure!   Two things I recommend you do -- make sure that the zone focus is set properly before shooting, and make sure that you don't inadvertently change the ISO setting.  Other than that, the camera is quite easy to use.  Like many Fuji cameras from a few decades ago, they seem to be uncommon here in the US."},
{"title": "Onward To Findlay via US 127.", "date": "Friday, April 19, 2013", "text": "A week ago, my good friend Abby and I drove down to Findlay, Ohio to attend the Film Photography Project's (FPP) 2013 Photo walking workshop. We decided to go down via US 127 and hit some small towns along the way in NW Ohio.  This post is about the sights along the way, and a bit about FPP. I have yet to finish developing and scanning my film from the trip, so what you'll see here are some digi shots and Polaroids. US 127 ends (or starts, depending on your point of view) just N of Higgins Lake in Michigan, where it merges with I-75, and terminates in Tennessee somewhere.  We took 127 S from US-12, and were able to visit Hudson, MI, which seems to have transformed itself.  I remember driving through there about 10 years ago, and the main street was filled with dilapidated old buildings with boarded up storefronts. This time, I saw that all of those places had been repainted, updated, and most had businesses of some sort in them.  That is a good thing to see.  With the prevalence of the internet, small towns can be attractive to artists and entrepreneurs, and those upstairs lofts can be used as apartments or art spaces, etc.  Anyhow, one thing in Hudson that captured my attention was the stone arch railroad bridge that crosses Bean Creek E of downtown.  That type of bridge is a rarity in Michigan, and it was used by the now long-defunct Lakeshore and Michigan Southern RR.  The tracks are long gone, but the stone arch remains. Built in 1871, it is a reminder of the amazing workmanship that built the rail infrastructure in this country. After crossing into Ohio, our first stop  was the city of Bryan.  I am greatly impressed at how many of these small towns that are county seats feature beautiful late 1800s county courthouse, usually in a town square of some sort.  There is a very attractive downtown movie theater (the Bryan) that is still running, which I found pleasing. We didn't walk about a whole lot in Bryan, but the Four Seasons Diner caught our eyes, and we could not resist shooting their sign.  After a little discussion, we both realized we were ready for lunch, and the diner was calling to us.  The diner used to be called Lester's and it has a very photogenic sign with a coffee cup pouring coffee...with lights.  Unfortunately is was daylight, so it wasn't lit up.  That will have to wait for another trip in the dark, I suppose.  Lunch was more than I could eat, but it was very good.  I'm not calling out this particular restaurant, but it is a common theme -- portions are way too big.  I'd pay the same for half the amount of food.    Quite satiated with lunch (I didn't even bother eating dinner that night), we drove S, and found the small town of Paulding.  There is a decaying old movie theater there, but no name could be seen.  Paulding had a nice mural on the side of an old building, which seems to be a common thing in Ohio.  It's certainly one way to add some color. The main street wasn't too bad, but there was some grunge to be seen (and photographed) on the side streets. Brumback LibraryOur next stop was in Van Wert, which has a beautiful Romanesque-style public library, the Brumback Library.  The interior is as wonderful as the exterior, and I could see how spending a few hours reading the paper and and so forth in there would be a nice weekly activity if I lived there.  The downtown has a lot of nice old buildings, we saw an excellent old coffee shop sign.  A classy old hotel downtown was also quite attractive. The weather was getting colder and nasty, so we continued onward to Celina, OH.  Apparently named after Salina, NY, Celina OH is another county seat, with a lovely courthouse with large columns -- unlike the other courthouses I have seen. A Van Wert institutionCelina seems to have a strange conglomeration of architectural styles on the same block -- perhaps it was someone's idea to recreate an old-world look in a small amount of space?  Anyhow, they also have an extant movie theater (the Celina) which is a good sign.  The town also has a fire house with a rather phallic tower out front.  I didn't look inside to see if it has 3-story fire-pole to go with it.By the time we were done in Celina, it was time to head to Findlay, so we got onto the highway and drove up I-75 to join our fellow photographers at the Film Photography Podcast workshop.  That will be the next post, so stay tuned.  I have many more shots of the towns, and of the FPP goings-on in my Flickr account, so take a peek there.one of the many odd Celina buidings."},
{"title": "Photographers Love Bookstores, and Welcome Literati!", "date": "Sunday, April 07, 2013", "text": "A few years ago, Borders Books went out of business for good.  What was once the best single bookstore in the world, morphed into a mega-chain of mega-bookstores with coffee shops, kids' toys, dumb trinkets, and even dumber CEOs running the company.  In the end, they forgot the very essence of what a book store is -- selling books, and being able to connect with your clientele. When there was just that single Borders on State Street, that was, the best bookstore ever. There were no toys, there was no coffee, no music, no movies-- just really knowledgeable staff, and excellent selections of books and magazines.  Yes, that was pre-internet, pre-web, pre-Amazon, and pre-ebooks.  Really prehistoric, right?  But as a photographer, and a bibliophile, nothing beats a real bookstore.  Being able to browse a shelf of books is somewhat like going out with a camera.  I never know what I'll see, but if I don't go. I won't see anything. Since Borders closed, we have not had a downtown general bookstore selling new titles.  Yes, we have five downtown stores selling used books, and I appreciate that, but until the past week or so we did not have one selling NEW books.  Fortunately, a couple of book-lovers stepped in and launched a new independent bookstore, called Literati Bookstore.  I went there on Friday, and was pleasantly surprised.  The owners seem to have a good feel for books that will interest the Ann Arbor shoppers, and are not duplicating titles that one might better find at Barnes & Noble.  You won't find a \"fill in the blank\" for Dummies there, nor a lot of trade paperbacks. Literati is a small store with two floors, and I am sure that they will be responsive to customer suggestions.  The store invites browsing, and is very attractive.  I really hope that the owners succeed, because book-selling these days is a tough business.  However, given Ann Arbor's hunger for books, and the downtown location, I expect that Literati could hang in there and even thrive.  They also showcase manual typewriters!Okay, back to photographers and books.  As an avid photographer, I also like books on photography.  No, I don't need yet another technique book, and there are plenty of those on my my shelves that I should probably get rid of.  I do like books of photography, since that is the best way to see a body of work without waiting for an exhibit somewhere. It is hard to judge such books online, and seeing them in person -- as in a bookstore -- is my preferred way.  Sometimes serendipitous finds will reveal some gem I had never considered, and without having the book in hand, I probably would never have bought it.  It also works the other way, too. A title that looks interesting may reveal that it's not buy-worthy, once I have looked through it.  The book I purchased Friday at Literati is John Maloof's  \"Vivian Maier Street Photographer.\"  It's an excellent book of Maier's photography with really nice reproductions.    If you are not familiar with Vivian Maier, just Google her and be amazed.  Better yet, take a half hour to watch this excellent video from the Chicago PBS station. I hope that Literati Bookstore succeeds.  Ann Arbor needs a downtown bookstore, and I intend to support them.  My book budget isn't huge, but I am willing to support a local bookstore when they carry books that I want to read.  Browsing is the best way to find a new book, so get down there and have a look.I'll be sending them a list of titles that they may want to consider carrying, and maybe we can get the Crappy Camera Club to have a reading list and do some event that will also generate a crowd there.   Welcome Literati Bookstore!!"},
{"title": "Nikon 1 V1 CX-format EVIL camera", "date": "Saturday, March 30, 2013", "text": "Last year, Nikon introduced the Nikon 1 system.  I was skeptical of a camera offering yet another format, and trending away from larger sensors. The Nikon 1 J1 that I tried out in the store turned me off with only a rear LCD for composing. However, after my wife returned from her Florida vacation in February, she told me she wasn't happy using the Coolpix L100 I had loaned her, as it lacked an eye-level viewfinder.  Already aware of the fire sale going on with the first generation of Nikon 1 cameras, I ordered a 2 lens 1V1 kit from B&H for $399 with free shipping.  That included the 10-30mm lens, and the 30-110mm lens.  With a 2.7 crop factor, that meant 27-80mm and 80-300mm range for the two zooms.  Both are quite decent VR lenses, by the way.  Oh, so you really think I bought it for myself, right?  Well, not really.  It seemed like a perfect lightweight camera for her with an electronic eye-level viewfinder (which turns on as soon as you put your eye to it.), FAST AF, and the ability to use different lenses.   Unfortunately, my wife fell and broke her hip a month ago, so she has not had the opportunity to use the camera, and I figured that I should run it through its paces as much as I could. Impressions1. The camera is very solid, and has a good feel in the hands -- an important thing to me.2. The EVF is excellent, focusing is blazing fast and accurate.3. Color rendition is very good, and exposures are excellent.4. Battery life is excellent -- far better than my Olympus EPL-1.5. Quiet operation6. It does not look threatening.7. It has a 40.5mm filter ring that I already have various adapters for, from using my Olympus EPL-1.8. It takes a while getting to know the menu system and the many options, but whether I shot in full auto mode or in aperture-priority, it was easy to adjust exposures with the  exposure compensation adjustment.9. I especially liked using in monochrome mode, and am happy with the image sharpness and contrast.10. Like the other \"amateur\" Nikons, this one does not meter with non-electronically-coupled adapters.  For instance, I purchased a C-mount to Nikon 1 adapter, and had to use manual mode only, unlike the Olympus, which allows A and M mode for non-coupled lenses.  However, it worked very well with the same C-mount lenses that I had been using on my EPL-1, with no vignetting.  The 75mm 1.9 Kern-Palliard Switar looked like it belonged on the camera.11. When you unlock the lens, the camera turns on -- excellent!12. If you want to see what a real pro can do with this camera, look here!Annoyances1. Unlike some people who have bashed this camera from the get-go, I have no hate agenda going on here.  The fact is, the menu system does work and it takes a little getting used to -- Nikon aimed this camera for the crowd coming form a P&S, where menu choices proliferate.  Yes, us advanced photographers like wheels and buttons that are physical, and Nikon could have put the PSAM dial right on top of the camera top deck like it does with most of its other models. I understand that the Nikon 1V2 fixes that problem.2. The lack of a regular flash shoe.  Really?  Is that so hard to include?  I suppose I'll have to buy an adapter to use my other flashes. No built-in flash in included in the 1V1, either.---That's basically it.  I would like to add the 10mm 2.8 lens or the 18.5mm 1.8 lens to the kit.  I think this is a very under-rated camera and it takes images that are better than my old Nikon D70.  It weighs a lot less than my D90, and realistically, would be a far better camera on a trip with a couple of lenses.  I have yet to mount the camera in a tripod for night shots, etc., but will do so soon.  It has been too cold at night for that stuff.  I may just have to find a used 1V1 for myself, unless my wife decides that she doesn't want it.  If so, I'll probably sell off my M4/3 gear and stick with the Nikon systems.   Oh, and my wife is recuperating well from her broken hip.  She'll want to use this camera soon, I suppose...By the way, EVIL means -Electronic Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens camera.I used a +2 series 6 diopter on the 10-30 zoom for this one."},
{"title": "Playing With Polypan F", "date": "Sunday, March 24, 2013", "text": "In late 2012, I purchased a bulk roll of Polypan-F from a seller on ebay.  It was shipped from Germany, and  the film can has nearly 300 ft of film in it.  At the price I paid of about $25, it is quite inexpensive.  It is apparently a cine copy film, as it has no anti-halation layer, a polyester base, and rounded sprocket holes.  There's bee a lot of chatter about this film on APUG, Flickr, and the Film Photography Project site.  It doesn't matter to me who made the film, or what it's intended use was (as if that has stymied me before).  My question is pretty simple -- what do I get when I shoot this like any other b&w film at the box speed?  Forget the instances of getting a \"glow\" (like some of those Lucky films) in the highlights.  Is this film any good at recording what I am shooting?  How does it work with D-76?  If a film can't deal with D-76, then it better be TechPan or another high-contrast film.I went into my darkroom and respooled about 90 feet pf the film from the large reel in the can to a smaller reel that will fit into my bulk loader.  I had heard that the film scratches easily, so I took great care to handle it as little as possible.  Once in the bulk loader, I filled a half-dozen 35mm cassettes, printed out cassette labels, and was ready to go.    The ISO was 50, and I developed the film in D-76 1:1 for 8 min at 68 deg.

In the snow and ice photo, I can see lots of detail, which is very good.  This was under cloudy-bright conditions, so the snow brightness isn't totally taking over the scene. There is lots of detail in the darker water areas of the image.roll 1, shot at Hudson Mills with Nikkormat FSThe first roll convinced me that this was going to be a lot of fun to shoot with.  Rolls 2 and 3 were shot in Kansas with my Nikon EM.  As much a P&S SLR as can be.  I was quite happy with my results, and know that I'll continue shooting with this film until I use it up. A couple things to remember:1. This film has no anti-halation layer, and the polyester film is very good at \"light piping.\"  Make sure that you load the film into your camera in subdued light. 2. If you don't want halos around bright objects, use a camera with a non-shiny pressure plate. 3. Shot at box speed it works great, though others have pushed it to 200 with good results.4. The grain in D76 1:1 is quite good,   and I see no need to use another developer, though I will try caffenol-C sometime.5. Supplies of it from Europe are sporadic, so if you see it, buy it.a sidewalk in Lawrence, KS.somewhere W of Chicago.More images from the Polypan-F are on my Flickr site!"},

{"title": "Riding the Rails", "date": "Saturday, March 09, 2013", "text": "A week ago, I embarked on a trip to Lawrence, KS by train.  It had been quite a while since I had made a lengthy train trip -- 47 years, in fact.  I left Ann Arbor about 7:30 am and arrived in Chicago about 11 CST. I had a few hours to kill, so I met up with my friend Trish, and we had lunch and went to the Art Institute of Chicago afterwards.  It was a quick visit, but always fun seeing a fellow photographer, and Chicago has no lack of photographic subjects.  I barely made my train to Lawrence, but once I was on the Southwestern Chief heading west, I relaxed and enjoyed the ride.  Returning, I left Lawrence KS on Thursday  about 6:45 am and made it home to Ann Arbor at about 11:45 pm.  The short layover in Chicago enabled me to have dinner at Union Station and walk around a bit shooting some photos of that beautiful place.I took a few cameras along -- my Olympus EPL-1 M 4/3 camera with the 17mm lens, my pocket Sony Bloggie camera, my Nikon EM with the 50mm 1.8 E lens, and my Debonair toy camera.  The shots presented here are all digital shots, as I have yet to process my film, so that will have to wait for another blog post. Train travel is very attractive to me -- I love watching the landscape roll by, and the various factories, small towns, train crossings, farms, urban centers, etc.  It really is a slice of America, and you see so much more riding in the train, and gain a better appreciation of distance than via plane.  You see the wildlife, too.  I saw many turkeys in the woods, whitetail deer, a red fox, hawks, owls, crows, and other birds.  Instead of seeing road-kill, I saw lots of wildlife. Railroads are still the unifying infrastructure across America.  You really get a feel for this when you travel by rail.  The rail yards with many, many tracks, passing freight trains, and industrial and agricultural centers with trains serving them.  You don't really get that impression from the highway unless you make a concerted effort to see those places. I mostly enjoyed my Amtrak experience.  Two things would have made it better -- high speed rails and better rail beds.  Oh, and more service to smaller towns.  That didn't affect me, but I suspect it affects others that have to travel some distance to a train station, especially when trains used to serve their community. I could see a lot from the train, and I look forward to seeing how my film shots came out later this week.Even if you don't have to take a long trip, I suggest a day trip via Amtrak.  Go early in the morning and return that same evening.  Bring your cameras, as you will see different scenes than you would by highway.   Go with a bunch of friends, and make it an even more memorable trip."},

{"title": "Kodak Profoto XL Film", "date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2013", "text": "A month or so ago, I ordered some film from the Film Photography Project Store.  Three of the rolls were Kodak Profoto XL, a film I had seen online and mentioned on Flickr, but had not previously seen in person. The expiration date is 04/2013, so to me, the film is still fresh!  I did some digging around on the net, and it appears from Kodak's Spec sheet that it was introduced in 1997, and not for the US market, as it is a \"colour\" film.  It doesn't appear to have the same palette as the Kodak Gold 100 line, and is more like a Portra film.  It is not a \"consumer-grade\" film, as it is marked \"Kodak Professional\" for what it's worth.I finally loaded up my Nikon EM with a roll of the stuff, and shot at various places -- at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, downtown Ann Arbor, around campus on a snowy day, some indoor portraits, and in Dexter.  I dropped the film off at Huron Camera in Dexter and had the images scanned in by them to save me an hour at my computer.  The images below have had very minimal adjustments made to them, and I really like the look of the film.  The saturation is very pleasing, and it doesn't seem to be as blueish as Kodak Ektar.  I typically like to shoot ISO 100 films unless there is a reason to need a higher ISO.  This film has a nice grain, and I think my results are pretty good.  I highly suggest picking some up while you can."},
{"title": "Shooting By the Seat of My Pants", "date": "Sunday, February 10, 2013", "text": "It's not too often that I come across a classic Nikon film camera that I have not already tried out, and rarer still that I find one that I have never seen before.Yesterday, I was in Huron Camera in Dexter to drop off some film, and to have breakfast at Joe and Rosie's with my buddy Marc.   I was looking in their dsiplay cases where the Nikon items are kept, and saw a lens that interested me -- a 100mm Vivitar, Non-AI lens.  Not having a non-AI camera with me to try it on, I asked if it could be attached to one of the Nikkormats in the case.  Cheryl handed me a slightly beat-up Nikkormat, and I was momentarily confused, as it was lacking the metering prong that would allow the lens to couple to the meter.  It was a Nikkormat FS, an \"economy\" model that lacks the meter and mirror lock-up that is found on all other Nikkormats.  A contemporary of the Nikkormat FT, it was produced from 1965-71.  Since it has no meter, it lacks a battery, as well as the dials and display of the FT and FTN.  It also weighs a bit less.  In other words, it's not too different from a plain-prism Nikon F.  Because it lacks a battery, it is truly a bare-bones, fully manual camera.  When I have a camera with a non-functional meter, I am always thinking that I wish it were working so that I could use it.  With the Nikkormat FS, that is not the case.  Of course, having a separate light meter is helpful, and I have one when I am shooting my medium-format cameras.  Of course, since I had never seen an FS before, I bought it for $39.Once I got the Nikkormat FS home, I put on a slightly banged-up early version of the 50mm f/2 Nikkor-S lens that has the focal length marked as 5cm and the distance scale in feet.  It is one of the best lenses ever made, and was in production for years.  Later in the afternoon, I took it into town as the sun was low in the sky, and shot a roll of Kodak T-Max 100 that expired in 1999. \"Metering\" was by my seat of the pants.  Every shot on the roll was acceptable, which must mean that my sunny-16 intuition is pretty good when I decide to use it. With all of the digital stuff that is being produced today, we take it for granted that any image is usually going to be properly exposed and in focus.  The Nikkormat FS gets one back to the basics of photography, and in that, figuring out the light on one's own becomes a necessity.   That sort of ties in with the \"slow photography\" movement that has become a news-worthy item.  For many of us, we have always been into \"slow photography\" we just thought that it was the way it was done. You don't have to own a Nikkormat FS to go meterless -- there are thousands of cameras that never had meters.  However, it would be hard to find one with a better lens than that 50mm f/2 Nikkor lens.  If you want to go 35mm meterless, look at an Argus C-4 (the most usable Argus made), a Kodak Pony, a plain prism Nikon F, some of the Minolta SR-series SLRs, Pentax S2, a Zorki rangefinder, and for the cream of the crop, any thread-mount Leica."},
{"title": "The Little SLR That Could... The Nikon EM", "date": "Sunday, February 03, 2013", "text": "Nikon EM with MD-E winderThe late 1970s and early 1980s were  an interesting time for photographers. Not yet into the auto-focus era, but micro-electronics were becoming more abundant in cameras.  Nikon's cameras have many accessories that can be used with a number of their camera bodies from the F2 through the Nikkormat and FM and FE models.  But what about the person that wanted the benefits of using an SLR without the hassle of knowing about setting exposure, and that that stuff?  Nikon came up with a small and yet elegant SLR that fit that requirement to a \"T.\"  Not only that, Nikon introduced a line of cheaper Series E lenses that were optically very good, but used some plastic instead of metal where it made sense. The Nikon EM was introduced in 1979 as a camera for what we today would call the \"soccer mom\" market.  That is, a relatively inexpensive SLR with automatic features for someone that wanted to photograph events, etc. without having to figure out settings, but still get better results via the lenses that Nikon made.  Of course, by today's standards, the EM is quite limited for a P&S SLR.    However, at the time, and in comparison to its peers, the EM was quite capable.  It features: Vertical-travelling metal shutter with electronically-controlled stepless shutter speeds from 1- 1/1000 sec.  A metering range of EV 2 to EV 18 (meaning very capable in most situations).  ISO film speed setting of 25 to 1600backlight exposure compensation buttonM90 and B setting (the M90 works with or without batteries)contacts for using an auto-winder (the MD-E as shown)rugged metal chassiscompact size, weighs about 1 lb.In short, pretty much what anyone needs without manual control.  The typical lens that came with the EM is the 50mm f/1.8 Series E lens.  Not a bad lens at all, and the later models with the silvery metal ring are supposedly better made than the more plasticky earlier model.  Of course, any Nikon F-mount lens that is AI or AIS or even AF-D (manually focused) can be used with this camera, so you can plop a 500mm mirror lens on it if you wished.   A few things to know about the EMWhen you load film into the camera, you may think that the meter is not working, as the needle in the viewfinder will be in the red zone over 1/1000 sec.  Once you advance the film to frame 1, the meter kicks in.  This makes sense for an AE camera, as if the meter worked as soon as you loaded the film, it would fire the shutter at whatever speed the meter indicated.  So you load it with the lenscap on, and it takes 1 second for each time you wound and fired the shutter to advance the film.  So it is a good feature, not a bug.  However, if your batteries are bad or something else is wrong with the camera, you will know when the meter doesn't activate at frame 1.  Also, this is why you can't test shutter speeds with the back open.If you want to compensate your exposure, such as shooting on snow or a bright beach, or maybe a black cat in a coal mine, you can do so by re-setting your ISO dial.  So, for shooting on bright snow using ISO 400 film, you would set your ISO to 200 (you want MORE light to compensate for the bright reflectance reading, not less).  Remember to reset your ISO when you are done.The meter will activate as soon as you press on the shutter release, and you do not need to back off the advance lever away from the camera body to do so, like many Nikons such as the FE.Find the SB-E matching flash unit for easy flash shooting.  Adding the MD-E motor drive makes this camera really quick to use.A used EM in good shape should cost you anywhere from free to less than $50.  I paid $6 for mine, and the winder was $10.   As a small SLR, it is one that can be easily carried with that 50mm series E lens.  So long as you have fresh batteries (2 LR-44) the camera will be ready to shoot when called upon.  Perhaps it might not be considered to be the pro-powerhouse of the F3 or the FM2N, but like any camera, it will do as well as the person that wields it.  Besides, it's all-black, so that must mean it's \"pro-grade\" right? :)Some recent examples from my EM:Inside the bakehouseTransit Center at the MuseumLiberty Loftswhere to?under the Libraryfilthy habitsBell Tower HotelThe big PAt the Small Plates reception, using the SB-E flash."},
{"title": "The Mighty Nikon FE", "date": "Sunday, January 27, 2013", "text": "A few weeks ago I purchased a lot of 5 cameras for $31, including postage.  All were advertised as being in as-is condition.  Well the only dog out of the bunch was a Mamyia 1000 DTL, which I wanted for its 135mm mamiya/Sekor lens (which turned out to have fungus.).  The other cameras in the lot were a Nikon EM, Nikon FE (black), Nikon F50 with the panorama mode, and a Nikon N2000.  All appear to work perfectly with new batteries in them. So, at $6 a camera, I made out very well.  In fact all but the Mamiya are also in very good cosmetic shape as well. The 6-dollar Nikon FE body. The 28-85 AI lens is one I have had for quite a while -- it was a gift.The Nikon FE was my first manual-focus Nikon, which I purchased used at a local camera store around 2001.  I think I paid about $90 for it at the time.  I used the heck out of it, and it was my go-to camera until I replaced it with a Nikon FM2N.  I don't want to think of how many Nikons of various models have passed through my hands over the years, but the FE remains dear to me.  The only problem with them is that they are now pretty old cameras (1978-82), and many have had a lot of rolls of film through them. Consequently, buying a used one unseen may not be worth it unless it's really, really cheap.  Of course, film cameras have been sinking in price, but an FE in really good condition still has value.  Most of the FEs you see will be the chrome version, and the black version is highly sought after. Not that they work any differently, mind you.  They just have that look of quality and ruggedness with the black body.I was very pleased to see the meter work like it should after I put in a new 1/3N cell into the camera.  The mirror foam needs to be replaced -- it's not gooey, just old.  I think the foam in the back has long dried out, but I did not see any light leaks in the roll of film that I ran through it.The true test is shooting a roll of film, so I loaded some expired but fridge-stored Kodak Gold 100.    I shot outside on a cold and windy day -- the windchill was below zero F., so that was a good test, as far as I am concerned.   The camera worked flawlessly.  All I  can say is that I am pleased as can be with the camera.  Finds like that don't come along every day.  However, I have so many Nikons that I use regularly, this camera probably won't see that much use. So, I am giving it to a friend of mine that was very interested in it.  I think she will have a blast with it.  Far better to  use a camera than just keep it in a drawer!"},
{"title": "Small Plates Exhibit Opens Friday", "date": "Wednesday, January 23, 2013", "text": "I have been busy getting things together for a new photo exhibit from people in the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club.  Small Plates is all about the small image, and my explanation of the show follows:Throughoutthe history of photography, the small image has usually had a personalconnection. Examples would be a Daguerreotype photo in a locket, small tintypesmade by street photographers, or cartes de visité made in a studio. When the Kodak Brownie andits descendants became popular and put a camera into the hands of nearlyeveryone, the resulting many millions of snapshots were the typical size of 4x6inches or less. In fact, the bulk of photographs from the 1920s onward arelikely to be snapshots in the form of contact prints or smallenlargements. Today,people take and show digital photographs on hand-held devices, and often neverlook at images larger than their cell phone screen. Millions of digital imagesare shared online every minute, often viewed at about the size of snapshotsstored in family photo albums. Small images are meant to be viewed no fartheraway than arm’s length. This is a much more personal experience than largegallery images.Itis in this spirit of the intimacy of the small print that Small Plates is beingpresented. The Ann Arbor Area CrappyCamera Club (A3C3) is a film-based group of photographers, and all theimages presented in this show were produced by film cameras of various typesfrom a 110 Instamatic to 4x5 view cameras. Many are Polaroids, which areas unique as Daguerreotypes or tintypes. Some images are contact prints, andsome are only slightly enlarged.  All are meant to be viewedclose-up.  Unliketheir ephemeral digital counterparts, these images have solidity and areself-contained exhibits. Although the equipment and processes have changedgreatly over the history of photography, it is interesting that our basicrelationship to the image has not.  Sixexamples of vintage photographs are included that demonstrate the differenteras of photography and the different processes in vogue at the time.  I enjoy curating an exhibit, and though I did not produce any new work specifically for the show, it did prod others into doing so, and as a result, I think it will be quite enjoyable for the viewers.  If you miss the opening, the Argus Museum is open M-F from 9-5."},
{"title": "Following the Raisin River", "date": "Sunday, January 13, 2013", "text": "On the last day of 2012, my buddy Marc Akemann and I went for a short photo trip.  My aim was to photograph some stretches of the Raisin River and the towns that we stopped at along the way.  We started sort of in the upper stretches in Manchester (Michigan), traveled SW towards the headwaters at Onsted State Game Area, and then to Dundee, where one of the mills that Henry Ford built still stands.  The Raisin River watershed is roughly the size of Rhode Island (with nowhere near the population density!), and the river is about 150 miles in length, meandering N from its source into Washtenaw Co., and then E and S again, finally emptying into Lake Erie at Monroe.Raisin River watershed, courtesy of  River Raisin Watershed CouncilSince it was December 31, we didn't have a lot of daylight, and it was largely an overcast day, which was good because of the snow and ice.  I decided to try out some 30+ year old Panatomic-X that I recently spooled up from a bulk roll, as well as some oddball film called Varicath II, which is a cine film for medical imaging.  Its ISO is rated from 6-25, and I shot it at 25.  The old Panatomic X was shot at ISO 25, but because the negatives were thin, I'll probably shoot the next roll at 15, just to see if there is a big difference.  Finally, I also shot Arista 100 Premium, which I think is actually Kodak's last run of Plus-X.  Working from close to the source (but not chronologically) to Dundee, here are some images from our little foray.Not too far from the sources of the Raisin in Onsted State Game Area.  This is across the road from Michigan International Speedway on US-12.  Arista 100, Nikon N90s with 24-120mm Nikkor.Downtown Manchester, viewing from the bridge.

{"title": "Mama Mamiya!", "date": "Thursday, December 27, 2012", "text": "I celebrated my 56th birthday on 12-12-12 -- an auspicious date, seeing that I was born in 1956, 56 years before.  A friend gave me a gift certificate from Huron Camera, which of course, might possibly be the best place locally to have a certificate from (at least for me!).  I made my way over to Dexter, and as usual, checked out the \"bargain bins\" in the back of the store. In one of them sat an SLR camera that I have seen very few examples of -- a Mamiya/Sekor 1000 DTL.  Now, me swearing off buying another camera, especially an M42 mount SLR, went out the window when I saw that the cameras was only 10 bucks -- with a Rikenon 50mm lens.  I checked all the functions, and aside from the battery-less condition, it seemed to work just fine. When I was at the counter, I saw that they had a 55mm 1.8 Sekor lens that matched the camera (including the original cool lenscap) for $29.00.  So, I bought the lens, the camera, some Ektar 100 film, and spent my gift certificate.  When I got home, I read up online about the camera, and sure enough, the  camera uses a modern LR-44 battery!    I cleaned the terminals, put in a battery, and the meter worked.  That was a nice surprise.  I loaded the camera with some Tmax 100 and over the course of a week, shot two rolls. I developed them the other day, and am quite happy with the results.  What is so unusual about the Mamiya/Sekor  1000 DTL is that the metering has a switch that is either \"S\" or \"A\" mode - meaning Spot or Average.  As far as I know, it was the the first SLR to offer that feature.  There is a partially silvered area of the mirror where the spot metering area (CdS sensor) is located. The DTL literally means Dual Through the Lens metering. The metering is stop-down, and is accomplished by pushing the wind lever towards the body.  The metering is turned off by pressing on top of the round base of the wind lever, which releases the wind lever against the top deck of the camera. Pretty ergonomic, but certainly not obvious without a manual! Here is where I plug the Butkus web site.  If you download a manual from there, please donate to keep his site going.  The 1000 DTL was introduced in 1968, and my example is in really excellent condition.  You can read more about that line of cameras here.While Mamiya is well known for their medium-format cameras, their 35mm models never gained the prominence attained by other manufacturers.  I think the lenses are very good, but the bodies may not be as robust as the Pentax Spotmatics that they competed with.  When other manufacturers went away from the M42 mount, Mamiya  later went with a bayonet mount, in the Z-series.  Those SLRs were quite sophisticated, but apparently not as popular as other brands.  Due to issues with a supplier, the series ended in 1984 with the ZE-X. Mamiya stuck with medium format, and were quite successful with their line of professional medium-format cameras. Okay, on with the pictures! The following were taken at Matthaei Botanical Gardens on Christmas day. All are with Tmax 100 film, developed in HC110-B.  I used the camera's metering exclusively.This bonsai tree was donated many years ago by a deceased friend.Abby shooting water droplets.I am quite happy with the results, and the metering seems to be pretty accurate.  I look forward to doing more shooting with it, and maybe I'll find a 28mm Mamiya/Sekor lens for it."},

{"title": "Vivian Maier -- one of America's greatest treasures.", "date": "Tuesday, December 04, 2012", "text": "Yesterday, I received a book in the mail--\"Vivian Maier. Out of the shadows\" by Richard Cahan and Michael Williams. After reading the text and devouring her amazing photographs, I can say that few photography books have moved me the way this book has.  The horrific idea that her work could easily have gone completely unnoticed, unappreciated, and tossed away had the wrong people bought out the items from her storage locker isn't a thought singular to me. I first remember reading about finding Vivian's extraordinary cache of images a few years ago.  My initial thought was that her images were really good.  However, were the ones I was seeing just the cream of the crop, with hundreds of lesser ones predominating?  FHer images are empathic, thoughtful, and most of all, engaging, and good.  The authors state that her consistency of many \"keepers\" per contact sheet is proof that she knew exactly what she was doing, and stand as a testament to her talent.I went to Chicago in March 2011 to see the Maloof exhibit at the Chicago Cultural Center, which was very moving.  The images were wonderful.  They even had some of her cameras and hats on exhibit.  Take any street photographer that's famous, and Vivian is right there in the quality of her seeing, and her craft.By now, anyone following the Vivian Maier story must know that there are two collections of her work, with John Maloof owning about 95% of the negatives and associated materials.  The smaller portion -- still substantial, by any means, belongs to Jeffrey Goldstein with 20,000+ negatives.  I can't wrap my head around that much shooting of a Rolleiflex.  That is a LOT of film.  This book is based upon the Goldstein collection, and Cahan and Williams have put together a narrative that follows the arc of Vivian's life, and the people that she touched.  Vivian was \"eccentric\" to the families that she worked for, but it is apparent from the interviews that many of the children she watched regarded her as a sort of Mary Poppins.   Vivian's images aren't just shots of a time lost, but a celebration of everyday life, with all its warts and smiles.   The images in Vivian Maier - Out of the Shadows very nearly brought tears to my eyes--partly from the beauty and empathy of her images, but also from the realization that she did this for her own reasons, and that we are so much richer from being able to see what she saw.  I have not previously been moved by a photographic book as much as I have by this one. If you love good photography, an engaging story, and most of all, appreciate the work and execution that is needed for excellent street photography, you will love this book.  If you love the essence of humanity, you will love this book.  If you love b&w square format photos, well... you will love this book.

{"title": "The Nikon N90s - a Modern Classic SLR", "date": "Saturday, December 01, 2012", "text": "Back in the 1980s and 90s, Nikon was producing a slew of auto-focus 35mm SLRs, and each iteration had better features, with Nikon gradually introducing their AF SLRs in different tiers, catering to casual shooters, serious amateurs, and pro-level users.  In 1992, Nikon released the N90, their top-of-the-line camera for serious amateurs and professionals.  The F4 was introduced in 1988, and was Nikon's first F-series camera with built-in autofocus and autowind.  The N90 replaced the N8008s as the top non-F series camera in the Nikon lineup,  In 1994, Nikon added some improved features to the N90, including 1/3 stop compensation and a faster AF module, and called it the N90s.  Rounding out the field was the N50 for \"beginners\" and the N70 for the amateurs.  My first AF SLR was a Nikon N50 that Bill Brudon had given me, and I thought it was an amazing camera.  It was, coming from a Pentax MG that I had been using for 16 years.  The N50 however, had firmly established Nikon's habit of \"crippling\" the lower-tier cameras by not allowing them to meter without an AF lens, no depth of field preview, no remote release, etc.  Program modes were easy to use, and the camera also had the typical PASM modes that we expect.    The N70 was the next step up, which really was a replacement for the N8008s.  It had a quirky LCD on the top deck and selection mode that really made the camera a real button-pushing wonder.  I have heard that it was considered a \"dog\" by many users, who preferred the straightforward use of the N8008.  So, with that bit of history out of the way, here is what prompted me to write this story.I was in my favorite store last week --the dreaded Black Friday -- however, it was Huron camera in Dexter, MI.  A much better place to be than those other stores that were in the news.  I was rummaging around in the bargain bins at the back of the store and saw a couple of AF Nikons SLRs.  There were two N90s bodies, and one was marked $10 (and was very beat-up) and the other was marked $20 and looked to be in pretty nice condition.  Now, I need another AF film body like a hole in the head, but the N90s is a camera with all the features that one can ask for (except for a built-in flash, which designated it as a pro-level camera!).  I borrowed a set of 4 AA batteries at the counter and tested the camera out.  Aside from some elements of the numbers in the viewfinder LCD being faint, the camera seemed to work fine.  So, I bought it and shot a roll of Kodak Gold 100 and dropped it off at Huron the following day to get developed.  I picked up the negatives today, and am quite pleased with the results.

{"title": "Vivitar 35CA - a nice surprise", "date": "Saturday, November 24, 2012", "text": "A couple of months ago I purchased a Vivitar 35CA on ebay.  It wasn't in as good condition as advertised, and the shutter did not seem to be working properly.  I didn't pay much for the camera, so I set it aside.  Every once in a while, I would try the shutter (and I had put in a new LR44 cell).  To my surprise, one day it appeared to work like it is supposed to!  So, I put in a roll of Kodak Gold 100, and shot it over a couple of days.    The 35CA is an auto-exposure camera that adjusts both aperture and shutter speed automatically.  The only manual control is in B (bulb) mode.  It has a hot-shoe as well as a PC-sync connector for using a variety of strobes.  There is a Guide-Number setting on the side of the lens barrel that may allow for exposure adjustment based on distance, but I have not yet tried it.  The lens is a 38mm f/2.7 lens which isn't exactly wide nor fast, but it gets the job done.  A few years ago I reviewed the Vivitar 35EE, a slightly larger and older model that used mercury batteries. Like that camera, this one features a filter ring that allows you to use screw in 46mm filters.  So, here are some examples from the roll of Kodak Gold 100.  I was actually pleased with the camera's low-light ability, and less so with bright light.  However, it definitely will give results that are satisfactory, and maybe even just a tad funky.  More rolls need to be shot so that I have a better feel for what the camera can do.Abigail, having breakfast with us.Campus Transportation CenterDonate blood!hawthorn fruitsThe Art Deco front of the State TheaterNo Parking"},
{"title": "Lomography's A Bunch of ...", "date": "Sunday, November 11, 2012", "text": "Smart People.  Effin' crazy people.  I mean, in these \"dying days\" of film (which I have heard more than a few times), who in their right mind would design and sell a completely new roll-film camera that has a bellows?  Hellooo, George Eastman called and he wants his bellows back.  Say all you want about the folks of Lomography, but the latest camera being advertised by them, the Belair X 6-12 wants to separate money from my wallet in a most significant way.Lomography Belair X 6-12, image from Lomography.com, edit by me.Seen here is their Belair X 6-12 \"City Slicker\" model.  Note the 90mm and 58mm removable lenses.  The camera has auto-exposure (though the 1/125th sec max shutter might be limiting), zone focus, and 6x6, 6x9, and 6x12 cm negative sizes on 120 film. There are other models with chrome and snazzy-looking leatherette that reminds me of the Polaroid SX-70 design scheme.Yes, it has a bellows.  In 2013, we will be buying bellows cameras.  Take that, you damn digital sheep.I'm turning 56 on 12-12-12.  What better way to celebrate than buy myself a Belair X 6-12.  I don't need a full-frame D600.  It can't do what this camera does.  6x12 -- even if it has that Lomography look, is something that is very appealing to me.  Is the camera pricey?  No, not really.  In today's dollars, I am betting it is cheaper than the Kodak Tourist cameras that took 6x9 620 film back in the 1940s and 50s.  So, I am pre-ordering one today.  Of course, I can't actually review the camera now, because I don't have one.  But I do want one.   Damn those Lomography folks, making cameras that people want.  They should buy Kodak, as they appear to have a better grasp of selling things than the dumbasses in Rochester.Oh, and by the way, congratulations to Lomography for 20 years of fun."},
{"title": "Fast Fall Frenzy", "date": "Sunday, November 04, 2012", "text": "A week ago, I was in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan with my buddy Marc Akemann (who is an exceptional photographer).  I drove up on a Friday to deliver my daughter's 2000 Jeep Cherokee which I had driven down at the end of September to have some work done on it, and it's no fun driving alone on a long trip.  So, Marc and I spent the night in Marquette, and Jorie and Stephanie made dinner for us.  On the Saturday, we said our goodbyes to the girls and we did some shooting around Marquette and then over to Negaunee, where we did some antique mall camera hunting (Marc found a beautiful mint-condition Ansco Memo!) and some shooting in a town that seems to have two main business types -- bars and antique stores.Then, it was back eastward, and we stayed in Munising for a night.  Our plan was to do some waterfall photography, and we did pretty well, as you will see below.  Saturday afternoon found us at Scott Falls on M-28, and then at Munising Falls at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.The light in October and November is quite good for landscapes in the UP.  For one, it's almost as if the \"golden hour\" stretches for 2/3 of the day, as the sun is quite low in the sky.  If it is sunny, the raking light is really awesome. We had great light last weekend, and with no leaves on the trees, it made for some clarity in the landscape.  The temperatures were cool, but not too much so. In fact, except for early Saturday morning, we were pretty comfortable with just fleece jackets. A view from Straights State Park looking  S towards the Mackinac Bridge.  This is really nothing more than a snapshot with a Nikon Coolpix L100 (that had been given to me earlier in the week). This was on our way up in the Friday. Saturday morning in Marquette along the beach near the Coastguard Station.  The rising sun kept poking through the clouds, and gave us some interesting morning light.  I really loved the combination of the reddish sand, the bluish rocks, and the light coming off the water here.  Olympus EPL-1 with 14-42 lens.I did shoot some film on this trip, and the Velvia and Provia film is out being processed. My cameras of choice for film were mostly my Nikon F3HP and F2S, and my Yashica A TLR.  I have yet to develop the roll of Efke KB25 that should have some kick-ass waterfall shots on it.  So, all of the images on this post are from digital capture.Marc with his Ziess Super-Ikonta at Deerton. Amazing camera that he bought online for only $50.We stopped at Scott Falls, which empties into a small creek along the S side of M-28 in Alger Co., W of Christmas.  I have shot these falls many times, but this time, there was too much water flowing down to even get to the spot that I have often shot from near the base of the falls.  That's a good thing, as some years I have seen the falls actually dried up.Munising Falls was a delight to shoot.  It's the first time I have photographed them in October, and it is a better experience when there are fewer people around.  The abundant rainfall this year also made for a more impressive waterflow, and the gray skies definitely tamed the contrast.  This was shot with my Olympus EPL-1 with a 25mm CCTV lens.We planned on doing several falls on Sunday, and our first stop was Tannery falls on the outskirts of Munising.  It seems to be one of those places that \"those in the know\" know about.  Once Marc and I realized how ridiculously easy it was to get there after we found the spot, I am sure we will be there again and again.  It's a 10 minute walk from H-58, at the junction of Washington Street and H-58. The property is owned by the Michigan Nature Association (MNA is a very worthwhile organization, and I encourage you to become a member).  What I liked about Tannery Falls is the access to the base of the falls and the cathedral-like backdrop to the falls, which are about 40 feet high, and fed by a small creek.We spent quite a bit of time there.  The woods were still, the air crisp, and the light was awesome.  Marc mostly shot with his RB67, and I believe he got some awesome shots with it.   However, my favorite shot of him on this trip was him standing behind the falls with his iphone.Then, it was off to Mosquito Falls about 20 miles farther on, including the dirt road from H-58.  The hike in was beautiful, and we saw very few people on the trails there.  The falls are a little over a mile from the parking lot, and worth the trip.  Of course, there were no mosquitoes there in late October, but I imagine how the area got its name, so June ought to be an \"interesting\" time to visit.The Upper falls, first:Then, the rapids or cascade :and finally, the lower Mosquito Fallssome detail:It was a great place to visit, and we were really pleased with the entire trip, as everything worked out well weatherwise.  We got back into Ann Arbor around 11 pm Sunday, and I know I slept well that night. If you are going to seriously shoot waterfalls, make sure that your kit includes:neutral-density filterssolid tripodremote release or self-timer on the camerapolarizing filterplenty of film or memory cards!Obviously, you can't control the weather, but avoid shooting in full sun, and spring and fall or often the best times to shoot, but don't forget winter.  You will be amazed by the ice sculptures."},
{"title": "More C-mount Fun", "date": "Thursday, October 18, 2012", "text": "Last week, I got an email asking me if I was interested in cleaning out the remaining photographic items from the basement of a photographer who passed away a couple of years ago.  He was a co-worker, and one of those people that leaves a lasting impression.  He died way too soon, but I would say that he lived a good life and enjoyed his hobbies, his friends, and his work.  His widow had sold the house, and needed to get rid of the last vestiges of things that nobody else wanted.  I accepted the invitation, and said that I would take it all off her hands.  I thought perhaps it would be just a couple of boxes, but instead I filled up my Jeep Cherokee to the brim, and did take it all, as promised. As I carried the boxes up, and consolidated some of the contents, I realized that there were a lot of small items that looked interesting.  The largest item, an 8x10 Seneca View Camera, thrilled me, as I had wanted one for some time, but could not justify buying one.  I hope to shoot with it soon. My Olympus EPL-1 with the Kern-Palliard 75mm lens.After I got everything home, I started poring over the boxes, and found some interesting c-mount lenses.  In this case, these are not video lenses, but ones made for 16mm movie cameras. All are quality glass, and this one, the Kern-Palliard Switar 75mm, f:1.9 is a real gem.  It's a precise, well-made Swiss lens, not some cheap Chinese CCTV lens.  There are small holes in the lens barrel so that when one reduces the aperture, little orange dots appear to show you the depth of field!  I have never seen such a thing before. Anyhow, I put it on my Olympus EPL-1 with the C-mount adapter, and am really pleased with the results.  Wide-open, the lens has a very pleasing bokeh, and because it's a short telephoto, it allows me to more easily isolate a subject from its background.On the Olympus M4/3 camera, the effective focal length of the 75mm becomes 150mm.  It ought to be quite interesting for portraits, which will be my next challenge to try out with this lens.  There were some other interesting c-mount lenses that came with a Bell and Howell 16mm Filmo movie camera.  I'll report on them after I have tested them out."},
{"title": "Shooting manually, naturally.", "date": "Monday, October 08, 2012", "text": "Last week I received my latest item of affection from KEH.  A really nice Nikon F2S in BGN condition.  Now, in my opinion (and that of others, too), the Nikon F2 is perhaps the nicest manual full-featured SLR out there.  It is also the last hand-assembled SLR sold by Nikon.  My second manual Nikon was an F2 photomic that I purchased used in 2001.  I think I paid between $300 and $400 for it at the time, and it was in much worse shape than the BGN grade F2S that I got from KEH for only $120.    I sold my old F2 about 5 years ago, after it developed some problems that would have cost more to fix than it was worth.  This F2S sports red LED in the viewfinder that are easy to see in dim conditions, and it all works very well.  To give it a first test, I shot a roll of Kodak Tri-X around town.The infamous graffiti alley.This old restored F-1 really caught my eye on the way home. So, the F2 shot an F-1.Armadillo at the museum.  Natural light.Bikes stopping for a red light!!!So, all of my shots on roll one were just fine, and I am really happy with my purchase from KEH.  The F2S will be getting more love soon as I take it out for some fall color this weekend."},
{"title": "Switching Gears...", "date": "Saturday, September 29, 2012", "text": "Most of my recent posts have featured small towns, Ohio, urban landscapes, and so forth.  While I enjoy those road trips and urban scenery, it's a change to go N and visit my daughter and her partner near Marquette.   I grew up in the NW edge of the Adirondacks in New York, and visiting the northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula remind me of living there many years ago.  There is a freshness to the air, and a rejuvenation of spirit when I am up here.  Things seem to have more clarity.   Marquette is \"just the right size\" for me, and it sits on the shore of Lake Superior.  Not the mining town of a century ago, but it's a far better place than back then.  In fact, it is a far better place than when I first passed through it in 1985.  The downtown is thriving, and lots of new construction is taking place at the lower harbor.   The area is scenic, and although there are many grand views of the wonders of nature, sometimes its is the tiny view that makes a big impression...It is a big change of gears to go from shooting in N Ohio, to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  It takes me a little while to get my brain in sync with my eyes. While I am inhaling that wonderful September air here, feeling \"at home\" and really seeing what's in front of me in the photographic sense is a more nuanced process.  I am often not pleased with most of my shots because while the area has a special grip on me, the shots that capture what I feel don't come easy right away.  This forces me to slow down.  The moment finally does come when I see something magical and I get it on film or silicon.  Then, it is that moment I know that I am truly in tune with the UP.    This is hard for me to really explain, but I know if you have had a similar experience, you'll know what I mean.  We will be returning home to Ann Arbor in a couple of days.  Will we come back to live here when we retire?  That is a good question.  There are friends that would be left behind, and all those connections that one makes when living in the same city for 30+ years.  However, I think that this place will give us more peace of mind, beautiful nature, and a way of life that is more beneficial in many varied ways.

{"title": "NW Ohio trip, Part II", "date": "Sunday, September 23, 2012", "text": "On the last day of August three of us went down to NW Ohio, primarily to visit Leslie Hunsberger at her store in Findlay.  That part of the trip was covered here.  Abby, Mike, and I also did some photo exploration of some other small towns and county seats on the way to Findlay and the return trip to Ann Arbor.Bowling Green - A college town with a main street dominated by Victorian-era storefronts, Bowling Green is a lively place.  There are some really interesting shops, and it seems to be an enjoyable place situated on the flat lake plain.  North Baltimore. - We erroneously got off at an exit on the highway due to construction, and ended up in this small town that held our attention for quite some time.  N. Baltimore has a small theater, a busy rail line, and some interesting shops and eateries. It also has just enough rust to make it look a little rough around the edges, which means interesting, at least to me.Taking Route 15 NW from Findlay, we encounted this hulking steer outside a large milling operation.  It was definitely worth the stop!A little further on, we encountered Ottawa.Ottawa - A tidy town with a beautiful statue erected in memory of their firefighters, dating back nearly a century. There is also a nice mural on one of the buildings.  I sort of felt like we had gone back in time a bit - that's not a bad thing. Like most of the places  we visited, it is situated along a rail line.Defiance.  I was looking forward to seeing the town of Defiance, and I admit that maybe with that name, I was thinking it would be grand.  The downtown main street was extremely busy with many lanes of traffic, probably pulling people out to the strips outside of town.  However, the closed upper floors on many buildings  lacked \"charm\" and it was underwhelming in many ways.  That might be an unfair assessment coming from an outsider, so if you read this and live in Defiance, tell me otherwise.  The city hall was symptomatic of what I mean.  A really ugly upper modern story added to a late 1800s building...An old window sign in Defiance.Napoleon -- Napoleon is a charming county seat with a beautiful county courthouse that dominates one end of the town. The Henry County Courthouse just glowed in the late afternoon sun.Our last stop of the day was in Wauseon.  This small town has a LOT of train traffic -- three freight trains went by while we were there.  The town has seen better days, like many small towns along the railroads, but the people there are friendly, and we ate at a small cafe that had amazing prices, good friendly service, and great pie... There is a train museum there, too, which has a nicely restored New York Central RR station. I'll admit that it is sometimes hard to keep motivated to shoot as the day wears on, moving from one town to the next.  In a perfect world, I would have some sort of grant (or lottery winnings) that would allow me to spend 24 hours at each place, shooting a lot, have a writer talk to people, and finding the scenes that tell something more about the character of a town and its people.  It definitely helps to have others along to keep the enthusiasm from flagging and share the observations that we came away with.  In this climate of polarizing politics, it's important to keep in mind that we are ALL Americans, with more shared values than we believe, and most folks treat you the way they'd like to be treated.  Going through the small towns of Ohio and Michigan, and elsewhere in the Midwest is one way to experience the resilience of Americans, and the ways in which we are connected."},
{"title": "Sally Mann visits Ann Arbor", "date": "Thursday, September 20, 2012", "text": "Sally Mann lectured in Ann Arbor this afternoon, as part of the Penny W. Stamps Distinguished Speaker Series, sponsored by the UM School of Art & Design.This was a much anticipated event for me and a bunch of my fellow photographers.  Sally Mann, an accomplished photographer that is probably most famous for her long series of portraits of her kids growing up on their Virginia farm -- spoke to a huge, packed house at the Michigan Theater this afternoon. If you are not familiar with her body of work, visit her web site for more information.  I really didn't know what to expect.  Photographers that present lectures are often content to let the images speak, and usually have some sort of backstory to tell about the images, the process, or the thought that went into making them.  Sally's lecture was journey into her past, growing up in Virginia, and her relationship with the black woman that worked for her family as a maid and caregiver.  It was a thoughtful essay on how she basically grow up in a culture that was totally incurious about the blacks in day to day affairs, how slavery and segregation has formed the South (and of course, the North as well)and how she has worked in her own way, to repay the debt to her nanny/family maid. There was a lot to think about from her lecture, and the images she did show us were primarily of her family's maid, and then the wet-plate images she has been making of black men at her studio.  She was quite eloquent about her feelings of doing portraits, and how hard it is to come away with images that she is really proud of. I know that good artists work on their craft every day -- that's how they become great.  We don't get to see the poor results from artists -- just the finished works that they are happy to finally show.  Since Sally is working with collodion, it's a much more pain-staking process, with many variables to consider.  Sally's description of her feelings about working on her portrait work made me mull that around in my head long after her lecture. This was a very memorable lecture - thought provoking, introspective, and educational.  I think that if some us came out feeling a little humbled, then that is a good thing."},
{"title": "A Visit to The Mecca in Findlay, OH", "date": "Sunday, September 02, 2012", "text": "On Friday, August 31, Abby and Mike accompanied me on another photo safari into Ohio.  Our stops were: Bowling Green, North Baltimore, Findlay, Ottawa, Defiance, Napoleon, and Wauseon.  Mostly I shot film on the trip, so I will do a followup post on the photography of the places we stopped after I develop my film.  A year ago, Abby and I ventured S to Findlay and some other towns which I blogged about.  At that time, we first met Leslie Hunsberger at her shop Imagine That! on E. Sandusky in Findlay.  In the past year, I have seen a lot of activity take place in Ohio thanks to Leslie, Matt Marrash and the Film Photography Project folks.  It was time for another field trip to Findlay to visit Leslie, so the three of us  left Friday morning (if you stick to the 4-lane highways, Findlay is a little over 90 minutes from Ann Arbor).Leslie has two shops -- Imagine That!, which sells photography-related products and services, and The Mecca -- which is her studio and camera collection as well as store.  This is what I love about Findlay -- it's very arts-oriented, with lots of loft and retail space available, allowing specialty places like these to exist.  There are many small art galleries, too.  Rent in a place like Ann Arbor really stifles that kind of use.    The Mecca is the \"film Mecca\" where you not only see lots of cameras on display, but they are also being used. Leslie posts here what current models are loaded with film to be used.We met up with Leslie and Lauren Bagley at Imagine That!, and had a blast at The Mecca talking about photography, film, and what has been going on lately in Ohio.  Back at the end of June, there was an event called \"Analog Pulse\" in Cleveland which was well-attended, and we got to hear about the young people that are using film cameras, and are enchanted by Polaroids. Leslie's film fridge is bulging with Polaroid film, and it would definitely cause legions of 'roid fans to drool...Needless to say, I was impressed by that film fridge, and I finally bought a package of the Impossible Project b&w Silvershade film for my SX-70. We had a lot of fun looking at the objects in the studio, and here are few more shots from inside The Mecca.Used Polaroid cameras have had a resurgence in sales, now that the IP film is available AND the Fuji pack film has been getting more attention.  Young people are excited to see that image come from the camera. While it's a niche product, it is proof that it still has relevance in photography. It is too bad the morons that bought Polaroid sucked the money out of the company only to kill it and the product line.  Leslie showed us the Polaroid 8x10 processor that she bought from Cynthia Davis (of Ann Arbor, manipulated Polaroid fame), and now that the IP folks are once again making the 8x10 film, she is able to use it!  Note in the last photo, the cameras that are for sale.  Apparently, the Debonair plastic camera is selling quite well, and is a favorite of teenage girls! Based on what I saw at Findlay, it is possible to make significant sales of film and paper and related supplies if one is willing to try and work with the local colleges, and tap into the \"analog camera\" segment of today's market.  I'm not talking about becoming just another stop on the Lomography bandwagon.  It takes some savvy and dedication to sell these things in today's market. If one is able to really make the film world accessible to new users (and recapture old users), by networking on the Internet, working with local groups, and \"branding\" appropriately, I think it could work in our local area.  If brick and mortar stores continue to operate the way they have been used to all these years, then film becomes less relevant and the local clientele suffers, and the store often ends up ignoring film altogether. Making that extra bit of effort to make film stand apart from the digital world could pay off.We had an enjoyable lunch with Leslie and Lauren at Logan's Irish Pub, and after doing a bit more shooting around Findlay, we said our goodbyes and headed off to our other stops for more photographic adventures.    Thanks again to Leslie for being such a gracious host and also for the goody bags!   If you are heading to Findlay, you can find The Mecca at 111 E. Sandusky St."},
{"title": "Film Swap Night", "date": "Thursday, August 23, 2012", "text": "On August 6th the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club (A3C3) did another Dexter Film Swap.  The idea is that everyone brings a roll of 35mm or 120 film (or both) - it gets placed into a bag, and people reach in to grab a different roll of film  than the one that was brought in.  We then split up, and usually have about 90 minutes to shoot the film and then meet at the pub afterwards.  The point is to have fun, and use something that we might not have ever tried before.  Of course, some of us try to do our best to bring something wacky.  Expired C-41 film is usually the norm, but slide film and b&w also get in there.  I ended up getting a 35mm roll of the Revolog Tesla 2 film and a 120 roll of Fuji 400 color film. The Revolog films are unique.  I think the guys selling the film are exposing the film stock to various static devices, etc., to produce strange and random effects on the film. Thankfully, there are only 12 or so frames on each roll. The Tesla 2 film has lightning bolts! (Thanks, Scott!).  Dexter is a different place to shoot for many of the A3C3 folks, though I confess to photographing there quite a bit.  Train tracks go past the Dexter Mill, and if one waits for the Amtrak train at 7:30 pm, one can get a fun shot...though I didn't expect a scene from \"Back to the Future\" when I took this! You can see the randomness sometimes coincides quite well with the subject, as in the train.  Serendipity Plus! The roll of 120 was a more traditional ISO 400 Fuji print film, which I shot in my Great Wall camera.  I thought I got some decent shots with it. The Great Wall medium-format SLR definitely fits the \"crappy camera\" category, as mine has some vignetting at the top of the back, and it appears to have a small light leak or flare on the inside.  Maybe I will have to make sure all the surfaces are painted flat black.Considering the challenge of the setting sun, I think I did okay.The Great Wall is a fun, but quirky camera.  The film swap is a great way to do something different and shake up your creative process. It gets people shooting film cameras, and that's what it's all about. The food and beer at Aubrey's in Dexter was good, too."},
{"title": "Argus Exhibition - \"Renegades With a Camera\"", "date": "Wednesday, August 22, 2012", "text": "If you have followed this blog long enough, you know that Ann Arbor, Michigan has a camera museum.  Argus cameras were produced here from their inception in the late 1930s to their demise in the early 1960s.  A pretty good run for a bunch of cameras manufactured in a small town.  The Argus Museum is located in the old factory building on 525 W.William Street (now much renovated, of course) that is owned by C3 Partners and houses offices for ONeal Construction, among others.  Although the museum is private, it is open to the public on weekdays from 9 to 5, and by special appointment on weekends. The Argus Museum Curator, Cheryl Chidester, has been quite active in getting exhibitions and gatherings at the museum, and I was quite happy with our 2008 exhibit there.  Last fall, the Argus Collectors group help sponsor the Everett Kuntz exhibit at the museum, and it was well-received. For the next month, there will be a small show from students from Henry Ford Community College, and it's called \"Renegades with an Argus.\"  It opened last Friday, August 17, and several of us Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club members attended the reception.  Here is the artist's statement for the exhibit:Historical Radicalism: Renegades with an Argus Camera20th century photography cannot be discussed or reviewed, without the mention of the importance of “small camera” photography and the use of film. Before the invention of the medium format and 35mm film cameras, photography was a laborious and expensive enterprise.In the 20th century, the camera became democratized and anyone could own and record their lives. The Argus camera, made in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was one such camera company that produced these types of cameras.The Wayne State University 20th century photography class alumni and the Henry Ford Community College directed study class were charged with exploring the idea of “following their muse”. The students were only requested to use an Argus camera as their tool of expression. We used the Argus models: A2b, C4 and the Argus 75. We chose black and white film, color transparency, copper toning and cross-processing techniques in the production of our images.We let the divine elements of chance guide us in our conversations with our muses and let our muses reveal themselves to us in these visual apparitions.Many students chose not to perfect their images. They were interested in the “snapshot aesthetic”- to quickly capture and not refine the image- to retain a “pure” image. Others let their muse take them by the hand and explore vanishing small towns and to reveal the life remaining- past and present.I chose to participate with my students in channeling my muse.Through the viewfinder of an Argus the sublime was revealed and imprinted onto our hearts. It was then that our images made themselves visible and can now be seen.Professor Deborah R. Kingery, Ab7102@wayne.edu My first impression of the exhibit was that it was great to see some students using quite old cameras and shooting film AND producing gelatin-silver prints!  Talking with some of the exhibitors, I learned that for some, it was the first film camera that they had used.  Imagine growing up in the digital camera age and someone hands you an Argus 75 and tells you to go shoot some photos.  I think that is pretty interesting and challenging.  My second reaction was that the images represented a wide range of vision.  Some images were quite excellent compositions, and others left me feeling, \"meh.\"  But that's me, and I don't have to like every photograph I see on a wall, and I expect the same from others that view my work.  I think the images were well-presented and flowed through the museum quite well. The print size was perfect for the space, too.   The Argus Museum has some limitations for its exhibition space, and it's a pretty intimate atmosphere. Given the parameters of the artist's statement, I think they fulfilled their mission.  The show is definitely worth a lunch hour trip if you are in town during the week, and since the exhibit ends September 17, don't delay in seeing it!"},

(Note, I know that  tsotchkes usually refer to freebies from trade shows, etc., but I think that is an appropriate use here.)"},

I haven't used it nearly as much as I should, since I have so many other small cameras.  However, the One-Touch is too good to let sit unused for long.  In July, I shot a roll of Lomo 400 color film (made by Kodak)- which seems like an excellent match.  To start out, I shot some frames while cycling around Marquette, MI back in the first week of July.  The One-Touch, with its 35mm f/2.8 lens and quick autofocus is a nice choice for biking.   My daughter Jorie, on the bike path that runs from Harvey to downtown Marquette.  The various bike paths around Marquette make it a wonderful place to bike around (or run, if you would rather use 2 feet).  The sun was setting, but the camera auto-exposed the scene quite well.Later in July, I traveled to Columbus, OH, and brought a bunch of film cameras, including the One-Touch.  We stopped in some small towns along the way, and the One-Touch performed very well.  In Fostoria, Ohio. Fire  escape and brick wall, Fostoria, Ohio. Inside the Franklin Park Conservatory, Columbus, OH. Outside the Franklin Park Conservatory.As you can see, this camera performs quite well, and at one time it was a highly-regarded point and shoot.  If you see one of these cameras for sale in working condition, buy it.  You will appreciate its heft and solid feel.  The photos that came from it are not bad, either.  I'll try and use it more often."},
{"title": "Time Warp in Columbus", "date": "Thursday, August 02, 2012", "text": "Last Saturday, Adrienne, Abby, and I drove down to Columbus and had a great weekend there.  The city is really a photographic feast, and the various districts deserve more exploration.  Our main purpose was to view \"The Radical Camera\" exhibit at the Columbus Museum of Art -- which was a wonderful and yet sobering show of the work of various members of the New York Photo League from the 1930s to 1951.  We also went on various walks around the city, and on Sunday morning, Abby and I explored the central part of the downtown area.  It was nice being in a functioning city, with all of the things one would expect to encounter - coffee shops, stores, apartment buildings, banks, statues, office buildings,  etc., and none of the despair and disrepair that Detroit seems to have in abundance.  It was fun walking about early on a Sunday without much traffic on foot or on the street. We did encounter a strange camera shop called Chick's Camera Exchange, which is closed on Sundays, and I wonder if it is open much at all.  The sign looked promising... Hmmm. the front window looks pretty untouched...long enough that the AA batteries have leaked out... Looking through the front door, I saw lots of items that looked like the place was caught in a 1990s time-warp.  There are kiddie bike on the floor with tags.  An online search did not say that they were closed, but it doesn't look like a too-active place.  maybe someone in the Columbus area knows.  The store looked like a great place to explore."},
{"title": "Some Fair Images from the Debonair Camera", "date": "Monday, July 23, 2012", "text": "In my last post, I described buying a plastic Debonair camera from the store of the Film Photography Project.  Turns out I was the first person to purchase the camera from the FPP store!  On Friday, I took my Debonair around campus and into downtown Ann Arbor to see what I could photograph during the huge Ann Arbor Art Fair.  I shot all 16 frames and developed the film yesterday morning.  I used a roll of Freestyle's Arista 100 Ultra (which appears to be a Foma film), and developed it in T-max RS developer for about 5.5 minutes.  Considering that the nominal exposure of the Debonair is 1/100 @ f/8, a sunny day will produce really bright highlights on light surfaces, and with the Art Fairs using many white-topped booths, it definitely shows.  However, mid-tones look good. Here are a few of my favorite images: Braids.  Different Strokes  Mr. Jo Jangles, one man band.Overall, I like this camera a lot better than the old Diana, and it seems to be better constructed than the Holga, too.  The rectangular 6x4.5 cm frame is fine, and it is easy to hold the camera and shoot in landscape mode.  It has a standard flash shoe, so I will carry a small fill flash with me next time."},
{"title": "Today's Mail --The Debonair Camera", "date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2012", "text": "A few days ago I was on the Film Photography Project's web site and saw they were selling a 120 plastic camera for the unheard of price of $19.99.  If you have paid any attention to the prices of Holgas and Dianas, this is a bargain!  I immediately ordered it, and it arrived today.The FPP folks are great, and included some extras, including a roll of expired Ektachrome 100 to shoot.  The Debonair was made in Hong Kong, and I have no idea when it was made, but probably not too long ago.   However the FPP folks got a supply of these, I commend them for pricing the camera so reasonably.  It takes 120 film and instead of the typical square format, the Debonair has a rectangular 6x4.5 cm mask, giving you 16 images per roll.  The lens has portrait, group, and landscape focus settings (from about 5 feet to infinity), and a maximum aperture of f/8.  The shutter speed is 1/100 sec.  So, for a sunny day, I'll use ISO 100 film.I usually try to include sample images when I write about a camera, but you'll have to wait until I shoot a roll with this fun crappy camera.  Meanwhile, if you are interested in the Debonair, I would order one ASAP, as I have no idea how many they have in stock."},
{"title": "Bloggie Good Fun", "date": "Thursday, June 28, 2012", "text": "About a week ago I received a new camera in the mail, a Sony Bloggie Touch camera (MHS-TS10).  A strange name, but obviously, a camera geared for those that want to post things on the Internet. Now you know I love a bargain, but it's not a bargain if the product doesn't deliver to expectations. This little camera is a very pleasant surpise.Several features attracted me to it:1. Compact size  4 3/8\" x 2\" x 1/2\" and weighs 4.5 oz.2. 12.8 MP fixed lens camera with the equivalent of a 32mm focal length in 35mm.3. 1080p and 720p HD video, with up to 2 hrs of video recording!4. 3\" touchscreen for controls and viewing5. flip-out USB arm for battery charging and image transfer6. 4GB built-in memory7. focus from 4\" to infinity8. Price -- it was less than $60, shipped.9 Tripod socket!It's the size of a small cellphone (and since I don't use a smart phone, this is pretty handy), and easily fits into a shirt or pants pocket.  The power-on and still-image shutter button is on the top of the camera, and the movie button is a HAL-9000 reminiscent button on the right side of the back of the body.  The lens is on the left side.  The diminutive size of the camera is balanced by the few controls one needs to use to acquire an image.  The ON button, the still-image button, and the video button are all that are needed.  The camera features auto ISO of 80-1600, and shutter speeds of 1/30 to 1/4000 sec, and a 2 or 10 sec shutter delay.The touchscreen works like any other device these days -- swipe and tap to get around.  The Bloggie comes with built-in software that installs when you plug the flip-out USB cable to your Windows computer. (Mac OS software can be downloaded from the web).  It was easy to install, and it installed the latest update from Sony.How did the camera perform?  Quite well, as I have taken it everywhere in the past week.  It works best in brighter conditions, but even in lower light it does surprisingly well with the auto-ISO of the camera.  Photos taken under ideal conditions are sharp, colorful, and in-focus.  Uploading images is fairly straightforward with the pop-out USB connector, as is sharing them with others on Flickr and Facebook via the Bloggie software.  The video is quite good, and the camera comes with a mini HDMI cable to connect to your TV.  Overall, I recommend this camera if you are looking for something fairly simple, yet takes quality still and video images.  There is a lot of technology built into the Bloggie, and the Sony name means that you'll get something that is fairly well made."},

I got a lot of good comments from people that saw the book, and it truly was done in the last days of Polaroid as we knew it then.  Sales have been slow, of course, but now that I have converted it into an ebook for the iPad, I hope that a few more people want to enjoy the images.  Polaroids in an ebook format are really perfect, since they were never large to begin with.   You can help me out by purchasing a copy from Blurb for only $2.99.   The Polaroid SX-70 was a great camera, and I miss being able to just go and buy film for it in the store.  I am on the fence about the Impossible project products.  When they are done testing it out, maybe then I will buy some. I still have many of the images in the book, some framed, and this one remains one of my all-time favorites."},
{"title": "Cheap Thrills", "date": "Sunday, June 17, 2012", "text": "Lately, I have been rethinking my approach to street photography, and what kind of camera system I use the most, and how do I leverage my typical assortment of lenses and accessories into a versatile set of tools.  I got thinking back when I started using Nikon gear, and AF cameras were what I started with.  I had an N50 - a competent but not necessarily light camera. I also had an N60, which was pretty decent, but limiting to me in terms of shooting with manual lenses.  My criteria for a street camera is -- lightweight, inexpensive, and easily used in a variety of situations.  My F100 does not qualify there, nor does my F3.  As I get older, AF lenses have become more relevant to my shooting, if only because I don't always trust my focusing in lower light levels.  That got me looking around at later consumer-level Nikon SLRs, and after a bit of research, I decided that I would give the Nikon N65 a try.  If you have been following my blog for any length of time, you'll know that I appreciate a bargain.   The Nikon N65 is a much-improved camera over the N60 that I once owned -- it is a bit lighter, with multiple focus points instead of a central AF point.  It also takes 2 CR2 batteries, which are quite cheap online.  The camera shown here was 9.99 + shipping with the manual and the Magic Lantern Guide.  The lens was not included.  It's a 10 year-old camera with not much use on it, and a perfect inexpensive addition to my Nikon family. I typically shoot in Aperture-priority (A) mode, but with this camera I decided to see what I would get shooting in P mode.   The top deck is quite familiar to anyone that has used a Nikon AF camera. Although the N65 has only a single rear thumbwheel control, it isn't a problem in A mode.  Exposure compensation is easily adjusted, and you also have Depth of Field Preview via a button on the face of the camera.  DOFP was lacking in the N60, and in most of the consumer models. Now, you are probably wondering if I have lost my mind, buying a lower-end AF camera, and why not the N80 (which I have owned)?  As I said, I am looking at the N65 as a street camera -- and it has the features I really need, and none of the features that I don't. It's cheap enough that I bought two.  You can find them like-new at KEH for about $23.  If you already have a lot of AF lenses, this makes a ton of sense to me.  The camera has excellent metering, fast AF, and DX-code ISO setting (which you can override by adjusting the exposure compensation, if necessary).   You can use the Nikon IR remote (ML-L3) for tetherless remote shooting.  You can use the newer G lenses, making for a very lightweight lens/body combo.  I highly recommend the kit 28-80mm AF G lens.  They were commonly sold as a kit lens with the N65, N55, and N75 cameras, and are actually very good optically -- and cheap.  My 50mm 1.8 AF-D lens is a perfect match for this camera, being both a normal fast lens, and relatively lightweight.  Another good lens choice would be the inexpensive 28-100 AF-G lens.  With that lens, you would be good for about 90% of the photographic subjects. It's a good camera for biking, and also as an AF backup to my F100.  Don't go off and buy the N55 -- that camera lacks some significant features that the N65 has, and is by far the worst of the lot, in my opinion.  If you are currently using a Nikon DSLR such as the D90, etc., and want to get into \"analog photography\" the N65 is a great choice, as it would feel quite normal in your hands, and offer you the benefits of AF (no using lenses designed for APS-C sensors, though) with the controls being very familiar.After having run several rolls of film through the N65, I am happy with the results and with the handling of the camera. It's certainly lighter around the neck. For those that eschew such low-end SLRs, think about this tidbit -- Galen Rowell apparently often used the even less-featured Nikon EM camera which did just fine in his hands.  It's all about your vision and the glass that you put in front of the film.  All of the images below were shot on Kodak Gold 100 -- my old standby color film.  There are probably a million N65 cameras sitting out there, abandoned after the owners switched to digital, so the cheap prices reflect that, not the capability of the camera."},
{"title": "Out and about with the Canon F-1", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2012", "text": "Over a month ago, a colleague at the Museum gave me a nice present -- his Canon F-1 with the following lenses: 50mm f/1.4, 28mm f/2.8, 135mm f/3.5, and 50mm 3.5 macro lens, plus the extension tube.  Now, I sold off all my Canon FD gear over a year ago, thinking that I was up to my ears in SLR systems.  However, this nice kit was too wonderful to say \"no\" to.  I did some cleanup of the camera, and put in two hearing-aid batteries, as the mercury cells that the F-1 uses are no longer available.  The meter sprang to life, and I was ready to do some shooting.  Now, Canon's F-1 is a lot more similar to the Nikon F2 than the Nikon F. It too, lacks a standard ISO hot shoe over the prism, as prisms are removable.  Therefore, there is an attachment for a flash adapter centered over the rewind lever.  I don't plan on using a flash with the F-1, so that's not a problem.  It's a fantastically sturdy camera that is a far cry from models such as the AE-1.  Of course, it is fully manual exposure, and if the batteries die, it still works without metering.  Ergonomically, it is nicer than the Nikon F2, and one does not have to fiddle with the \"Nikon twist\" to get the lenses synched with the metering prong.  Okay, so how is the camera in the field?I took it with me to Toledo in mid-May and shot 2 rolls of film near the Toledo Museum of Art, and another roll in Ann Arbor a few days later.  All were Kodak Gold 100 C-41 prints film, which I had developed at Huron camera, and then I scanned the negatives at home on my Epson scanner at 2400 DPI.

{"title": "Series Filters on a CCTV lens", "date": "Saturday, May 26, 2012", "text": "In my previous post, I extolled the virtues of the Micro 4/3 system, and my experience thus far with my Olympus Pen E-PL1 camera.  Since then, I have been using the 25mm f/1.4 CCTV lens with the c-mount adapter A LOT.  The images that I am getting from it have been fun, amazing, and have given me a creative spark that's been a bit lackluster over the past few months.  One of the oddities about this c-mount lens is that it exhibits a central spot of flare when wide open, and only when the light is in front of the camera.  Second, it doesn't exactly close focus as much as I would like.  The solution is to use a lens hood to help with the flare, and diopters to magnify the image, resulting in close-ups.  Hmmm. How to attach those things to an odd-sized lens?  Solution...I looked into my drawers of Series filters and adapters and ended up finding EXACTLY what I needed.  A Kodak Series VI ring with a 31.5mm diam. push-on adapter.  No screwing-onto the lens, this adapter just slips right over the outside of it with a fit that is perfect. A series system consists of a retaining ring, a non-threaded filter, and the adapter.  Different types of Series filters can be used with just one pair of adapter and retaining ring, or you can have various adapters for different lenses, and still just use the one set of filters.  The assembled filter.  A yellow filter is great for improving the contrast of B&W images under certain conditions, even with a digital camera.  Make sure that you set the image capture to Monochrome! Of course, the diopters and the lens hood are also used with the adapter, and the lens hood simply screws onto the adapter without using the retaining ring.  I am pretty sure many of the series adapters were used with cine lenses in the past.  I even have a Series VI gel-holder, which is quite interesting.  I could cut colored gels to fit in and achieve all kinds of interesting results.  For now, though, the few things I use most are all that I need for the CCTV lens.  That is the beauty of using Series filters. A few different filters and the adapters are all you need to use with different camera or lenses.  You can also buy Series adapters that fit 49mm and 52mm screw threads, etc., as well as Series VI to VII  or V to VI adapters.  It's quite old-school, and almost all of these items were made before the 1980s, and almost all in the USA.  Now that I have assembled a kit to go with my CCTV lens, I realized that I have many extras in the boxes of accessories in my basement.  After some sorting, I have enough parts to put together 4 sets of Series VI adapters + a set of diopters (+1, +2, +3), and a yellow filter.   Here's the kit.  I am offering these kits for $25.00, which includes USA shipping. The adapter is specifically a 31.5 mm diameter push-on for a CCTV lens like the one pictured. I cannot modify the kit for any other size. Payment can be made via Paypal.  You can contact me at mfobrien[at]gmail.com.   Unfortunately, I have only one other lens hood like the one pictured, so it's not for sale.   No diopter, here, just the lens hood.  That 25mm lens is just awesome!"},
{"title": "I Have Been  Converted", "date": "Wednesday, May 16, 2012", "text": "I recently sold off my Canon Powershot G11 and all the accessories that I had for it. Although I really did get some great shots with that camera over the couple of years that I owned it, getting a speck of dust over the sensor convinced me that the tiny sensor P&S was no longer in my future.  On that small a sensor, a dust speck can look like a black hole. Part of the reason is also the G-series design, as the lenses are not sealed. What did I replace it with? I have been secretly envious of the folks that have been parading around their micro 4/3 (m4/3) cameras, such as the Olympus Pen E series, and the Panasonic Lumix G series cameras. The compactness, the 4/3 sensor, and the possibility of using all kinds of lenses via adapters opens up new possibilities that I just could not get with a p&s fixed lens camera.  Anyone that knows me well can attest to my love of funky lenses and using Lensbabies, Holga, and Diana lenses on my SLRs.So, I bought a new Olympus Pen E-PL1 body from Cameta camera for $149 with free shipping.  I then bought an Olympus OM to m4/3 adapter for about $20, and used some of my OM lenses on the PL1 for a bit.  I liked it a lot better once I realized there was focus peeking at the touch of a button, since one has to use the LCD screen for everything. The \"Art Filters\" are fun - especially the \"pinhole\" and \"diorama\" filters. I also enjoy being able to shoot in 6x6 format, and see on the LCD screen exactly the same square framing.  I have had the camera for a less than a month now, and I really enjoy it more and more as I get accustomed to it.  My next purchase was the 17mm 2.8 Olympus lens, which I found as a factory demo for $189.  A perfect size for this camera, and it is the equivalent FOV of a 34mm lens on a 35mm camera.  So far, so good.  Next, I bought a 25mm 1.4 CCTV lens from China with a C-mount adapter for $27.00 Now I'm talking cheap here, but I do love the bokeh and the distortion and vignetting of the lens.  It has been getting a lot of use, and I really like my results with it.I see the m4/3 as a wonderful tool for those of us that enjoy experimenting with lenses and filters. In addition, the small, yet well-proportioned camera just feels right in the hand. I am seriously considering selling some gear and buying the Olympus OM-D in the future. The ability to use many different lenses with adapters is very appealing, and I am always looking for a lens that will give me something different -- something that sets my images apart from others.  It may not always be to everyone's liking, but it satisfies me, and my vision of what I am trying for, and that's what matters most.

{"title": "The Blue Waters of Port Huron", "date": "Saturday, May 05, 2012", "text": "Almost a month ago I went on a road trip to Port Huron, MI and Sarnia, Ontario with my buddies John Baird and Marc Akemann.  I finally have scanned in the second roll of Ektar 100 shot with my Minolta X700 from that day.  Early April isn't the most summery weather, and it had cooled down from the record-setting March warmth of a few weeks earlier.  However, it was a beautiful cloudless sky and just warm enough to not feel cold.  We traipsed around the downtown a bit, and hit some of the areas along the St. Clair River. If you don't know much about Michigan, you should at least know that aside from the southern border of the lower peninsula and the south-western border of the Upper Peninsula, it is a state defined by the Great Lakes. Port Huron sits at the bottom of Lake Huron, and the St. Clair River flows S into Lake Erie.  Across the water to the east is Canada. Fishing and boating are big along this corridor, and it was apparent in Port Huron.  Of course, the St. Clair River is also a commercial waterway, with Great Lakes freighters coming through, and industrial areas along the shorelines of both countries near the urban centers.  Like many small cities, Port Huron is not the place it was a century ago, but it seems to have held its own pretty well, and the downtown is a mix of old and new, with only a few empty storefronts.  We had lunch at the Cavis Grill (really, it is more of a diner), and enjoyed our meal there. Enough of reading.  Here are some images from the morning there. All were shot with my Minolta X700 and a 24-70 lens or the 135mm lens on Kodak Ektar 100, which is a superb color print film that reminds me a great deal of Ektachrome.Looking over towards Sarnia, Ontario.  The St. Clair River really was a opalesque turquiose blue.Waterfront property is waterfront property. You don't need a mansion to feel rich when you have a place on the waterfront. Ring-billed gulls are ubiquitous in the Great Lakes.  Yet, I love watching them and their adroit flying skills. The ones that hang around the Bridge to Bay Trail (see following images) are probably quite vigilant in watching what the people fishing are doing. There are a series of sculptures along this sidewalk, and each one had a couple of attending gulls. There were a number of people fishing along the river, and each person had multiple rigs set up on jigs to hold them on the railing.  I am not familiar with fishing laws, but I know that when I did fish, I thought one was limited to no more than two rods in the water at the same time.  I asked the guys what they caught, and said they got all kinds of fish there.  I didn't see any activity while we were there, but fishing is like the ultimate test of patience in my book. No bites yet. This guy was actually casting.   There are lots of channels and docks around Port Huron, and it is obviously a busier place in the summer months.Well, that's it for this photo essay.  It's always a different feeling when shooting film instead of digital.  One is more economical with the shots, for one, and two, I think I generally put more care into the composition.  Three, every film has a different characteristic, and that's what makes using it so much fun.  Try some Ektar 100."},

I learned basic photography with that Exa 1a and shot mostly slide film with it. I used the sunny-16 rule. Plus, the pocket Kodak Photoguide was my only source of photography information.  No meters, no eye-level prism, either. It had the el-cheapo waist-level viewfinder. Good thing my eyes were better then. I certainly didn't know any better that a prism would have been a wonderful thing.In the summer of 1976 I was a summer camp counselor at Wavus Camps on Lake Damariscotta, Maine. Weekends, I hitched rides up and down US 1 to places that are probably now a lot less picturesque. I didn’t have a lot of money, and I didn’t shoot a lot of film, but I did get a few good images, and amazingly enough, I still have all of my photographs from then. Best of all, I shot mostly Kodachrome 64.The Exa 1a is a strange SLR. The mirror is the shutter, which all one unit.  Not a horizontal cloth shutter like the beefier Exaktas. There is a very limited range of shutter speeds and of course, the shutter release is on the left side! I sold that camera about 12 years ago on eBay...now I wish I still had it, even if it was not the easiest to use camera. Still, it taught me a lot about photography.  About 7 years ago, I ended up with a lot of Exakta equipment which I used for a time, and then sold off.  However, I kept an Exa 1a as a reminder of my early days in photography. The images below were taken in Wiscasset, Maine in July 1976. The two ships are now gone, having been removed in 2004 or so.There was a lot of crud on the slides, and removed most of it in Photoshop. Considering that they survived moving around in college and nearly 30 years of being left in a slide box, they are in pretty good shape. I doubt anyone’s CD-ROM of images taken in college today will be around 30 years from now.Last... not from 1976, but May of 1977. It was the first spring with my girlfriend Adrienne, now wife (we married in 1978). We were roaming the countryside near Sharon, CT when I shot this (not so great) photo of a fern growing out of a fissure in a rock. Same camera, but not Kodachrome. Might have been Ektachrome."},
{"title": "It's Raining Canons!", "date": "Monday, April 23, 2012", "text": "A few years ago I expanded my camera stable to include Canon FD-mount cameras.  I did that with the intent to be more knowledgeable about a segment of the SLR world that I really knew little about except what I had read.  Over the course of a year or so I acquired a half-dozen bodies and a bunch of lenses and accessories (surprise!).  I felt pretty well-versed in the cameras that I had used, and appreciated the general robust build of the Canon FTb, and the other bodies were not bad, either.  My favorite of the bunch was the Canon A-1, roughly equivalent to a Nikon FA, though more fiddly.  Last year, feeling that I had way more cameras than necessary, I sold off ALL of the Canon gear that I had accumulated.  Well, nature abhors a vacuum, so guess what happened?  A few weeks ago, a friend gave me his Canon FTb with 50mm 1.4 and 28 f/2 lenses.  Today, a curator at the museum gave me his Canon F-1 with 50mm 1.4, 50mm 3.5 macro, extension tube, 135mm 3.5, and 28mm 2.8 lenses.  I could have said \"no\", but I never turn down a free camera.  Both the Canon bodies are in good shape, though the F-1 definitely has a bit of brassing.  I'll replace the mirror foam, check the light seals, install a new battery and give it a good cleaning.  The lenses are in very good shape, and the 50 and 135 came with the proper Canon bayonet-mount lens hoods.The Canon FTb QL.I'll run some film through these two, and hang on to them.  They are good examples of Canon's lineup back in the early 1970s.   The F-1 is definitely a chunk of metal, and I look forward to shooting with it.  The shutter is fairly quiet and the wind mechanism is pretty darn smooth. As Canon's answer to Nikon's F, it was a bit late in the game.  Nevertheless, it's a fine camera."},
{"title": "A Little Canon QL-17 Love", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2012", "text": "I had previously owned one of these fine little rangefinders for about a decade, and sold it over a year ago, complete with the matching flash and manual.  I think I paid all of $20 for everything.  Well, I sold it after I obtained a Minolta Hi-Matic 7S and fell in love with it.  Silly me, I should have kept it.  Nothing against the Minolta, but the Canon QL-17 is smaller and the aperture/shutter speeds are easier to set.  So, even though I sold that Canon for about 3x what I paid for it, I regretted it later on.  Well, Denis Dolgachev, a fellow member of the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club moved to Baltimore, MD and divested himself of a few crappy cameras.  I ended up with a very nice example of the QL-17 with new light seals, a working meter, and in really nice cosmetic condition.  That should not have surprised me, as Denis always takes good care of his camera gear. I was eager to try out the camera so I loaded it with a roll of XP-2 chromogenic C-41 b&w film and took it along on the road trip with Marc and John a few weekends ago. The camera appears to work pretty well, and I am quite happy to have one again, especially one in such nice condition.  Here are a few images from the first roll of film.  I shot this while waiting for the bus across the street from where I work.  Inside the Cavis Grill.  Marc is paying for lunch. Port Huron, MI.  Two All-American boys. Port Huron.   Yep, whatever floats your boat.The images look fine, and overall, the camera appears to operate normally.  It stays in my backpack from now on."},
{"title": "Sarnia's Murals", "date": "Sunday, April 08, 2012", "text": "It's been a little while since I have been on a day-long photo trip with my pals John Baird and Marc Akemann, and yesterday, we traveled to Port Huron and then over the bridge to Sarnia, Ontario.  It's been at least 6 years since I have been to Canada, which is way too long, considering it's only an hour away if I go to Windsor.  I have crossed the Bluewater Bridge several times before, but I was always on the way to somewhere else, so this was my first visit to the city of Sarnia.  We had a beautiful day, with not a cloud in the sky.  The downtown has a lot of interesting arty shops and galleries, as well as some indoor flea markets and antique stores. Oh yes, there are also plenty of bars.  However, what caught my interest was all of the different walls that had murals of some sort painted on them.  I have previously mentioned some of the murals I saw on a trip to Ohio last fall, but the walls in Sarnia are more with a united theme of the early days of Sarnia, as far as I can tell.  In addition to my fascination with the backsides of buildings, which I have also blogged about, the murals transform what are usually drab and uninteresting expanses of concrete block or brick into expressive and interesting focal points.  Sometimes they can be done with the intent of trompe l'oeil, which in the case of some of the scenes in Sarnia, are nearly that, but with the added historical theme.  In other cases, they can be part of a store or eatery to help advertise their services.   I am impressed by this one.  The actual mural is much larger, extending to the left with additional text. This wall is next to the Sarnia Historical Museum.  The planes are not well-rendered, but it does draw your attention.  What amazed me was the relative lack of graffiti around town.  Some difference from Ann Arbor. These next few are all at the back of the flea market and other adjacent businesses. Very unified depiction of an earlier time. This one is on a private residence, but it appears to keep the same theme. I think this one in an alleyway, is my favorite. Sorta 1970s.This one incorporates the Bluewater Bridge in a striking graphic design. Last one.  This looked like a good place to have a beer! It would be nice to go back again on a summer day and have the time to explore a bit more.  This is what I like about these road trips.  When I go without any specific agenda, I see more and love being surprised by things that demand that I photograph them."},
{"title": "The Holga 135 Pan - A Quick Review", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2012", "text": "I have flirted with taking panoramic images for a long while.  First there are the faux-panoramic shots - a mere crop of a 35mm negative so that only the center 18mm is used.  Some toy cameras such as the Ansco Pix Panorama work that way, as shown below.  Then, I ran 35mm in a normal Holga using a special back and mask (reviewed here).  It was basically a 24 x 58mm negative, and required one to open the camera in the dark to rewind the film into the cassette.  Workable, but not the best solution.  In the beginning of 2012, I saw an announcement somewhere for the new Holga 135 Pan camera, which takes standard 35mm film, and gives you a 24 x 72mm negative.  I finally purchased one from Holga Direct in Hong Kong, and with shipping, I paid about $100.  The camera arrived about 2 weeks after I placed my order, and last Saturday, I finally took the camera out to give it a test. The features of the Holga 135Pan:The camera comes with 2 lenses - a 55mm f/8 lens, and a pinhole lens with a f/236 aperture.  The fact that one can remove the lenses tells me that people will be experimenting with this, which ought to be fun.  I would not be surprised to see a wide-angle lens produced.  The lenses have the typical Holga zone-focus icons. There is also a hot-shoe for flash, a wide-angle viewfinder that approximates the FOV of the lens.  The shutter button has a socket for a standard threaded cable release. The toothed film advance is easy to use, and there is a film counter.  You can shoot double exposures, so be sure to advance the film after each shot, unless you WANT multiple exposures. The shutter speed is approximately 1/100 sec. There is also Bulb mode for long exposures.   The instructions say to use 400 ISO film.  Given the shutter speed, I think one could safely shoot ISO 100 or 200 on a nice bright sunny day.  I used a roll of Kentmere 400 b&w film for my test roll.  Since this is a panoramic camera, it is probably a good idea to use it on a tripod and make sure the camera is level.  However, it IS a Holga, so I imagine people will want to shoot it all sorts of ways.  If you use the pinhole lens (which I have not yet tried out), you will definitely want to use a tripod and cable release.  The back of the camera has suggested pinhole exposure times, using ISO 400 film.  That's a handy feature.My First Impressions:The Holga 135Pan isn't a Hasselblad X-Pan, nor did I expect it to be.  It's a Holga, so you should expect lens aberration, flare, soft-focus, and vignetting with the 55mm lens.  The camera is as simple to use as the Holga 135BC, or any other simple camera.  I think it's actually pretty well made -- certainly sturdy enough for typical use. Once I got used to the feel of the camera, I found it to be smooth in operation.  However -- make sure that you don't have the shutter set to \"B\" when you want the normal shutter speed, and remember to check your focus ring.  The B setting is easy to do if you are not careful.  Now that I have shot and processed one roll, I am pleased with the results thus so far.  Shooting a panoramic image doesn't work for every subject or situation, but I expect that once anyone shoots a few rolls with this camera, that will become clear. First, my sheet of negatives...A few double-exposures, some overexposures, and a non-exposure.  See, I am not perfect. :)However, I have to say, that for a trial run on a cloudy and misty day, the results were not bad for a Holga. I scanned the negatives in on my Epson flat-bed scanner at 2400 dpi.I am especially pleased with these two images.  Getting the framing exact will take some time as I get used to the camera. Getting some pinhole photographs will be the next step.  The beauty of this camera is that you can shoot pinhole or normal, just by changing the lens, which merely screws on. I imagine the price might turn off a few people, but seriously, who else is currently making a camera like this?   It's a small market, and kudos to the Holga folks for producing the Holga 135Pan.ADDITIONS From April 7... Looking down the St. Clair River in Port Huron, film is Fuji Superia 200.You can also go Vertical with a panorama... This is a Marshall Fredericks sculpture in Port Huron."},
{"title": "Lake Michigan Dunescapes Part 1.", "date": "Monday, March 12, 2012", "text": "On February 26, I drove across the state to Berrien County, which lies near the S end of Lake Michigan.  My fellow photographer,  Abby Alvarez, accompanied me and we had a great time exploring Warren Dunes and Grand Mere State Parks.  I really didn't know what to expect to find, as it's been years since I have been to Warren Dunes, and it was always during the summer when I visited.  Winter has been fleeting, but to my amazement, the dunes had some wonderful textures created by layers of snow and sand.  It made walking up one of the large dunes quite easy, as the sand was semi-frozen. In addition, there was a really stiff, cold wind blowing up from the face of the dune, which I think I could have flown into if I had been wearing one of those wing suits (and gotten a face full of sand...).I had decided ahead of time that I was going to shoot some of my remaining Kodak Technical Pan film. I brought my Nikon F3HP annd several lenses for the b&w shots, and my trusty Pentax ME with color film for everything else.  I put a polarizer on the 24mm lens I was using for most of the dune shots, and right away, was looking at nearly a 2-stop light reduction.  TechPan is rated at ISO 25, meaning that if I decided to shoot at small apertures, longish exposures were going to be the rule.  I used my Bogen tripod, and for the most part, my results were pretty good, although on close inspection of the negatives, I could see that the stiff wind definitely had an effect on a few shots. Next time, I'll bring the really heavy-duty tripod.Warren Dunes State Park encompasses about 1900 acres of land, and has campsites, and of course, a huge beach area. It is usually swarming with people in the summer months, and the campsites are almost always filled.  The largest dune is over 200 feet above Lake Michigan. Going there in the winter provides one with a much different experience.  We saw just a few cars in the parking lot, and watched with great amusement as a family was sledding down one of the few spots with snow on their plastic sleds. The combination of sand-covered snow and frozen dunes, ghost trees that had been uncovered by the dunes, as well as the winter forms of living trees, gave the main dune a very stark, post-apocalyptic appearance.  Shot with the Pentax.I developed the TechPan film in Technidol LC developer.  I have enough of that to shoot about 10 rolls of TechPan, so it looks like I will run out of film and developer at the same time.  Looking up towards the big dune from just above the parking lot.  I really liked the ghost trees towards the top.  These are trees that were once buried by the dune, and then uncovered as the sand blew elsewhere.   The patterns in the sand were amazing.  In the summer, blowing sand covers everything.  This looks like an aerial photograph taken from about 60 miles up. The polarizer really made the scenes \"pop.\"  However, I also noticed a bit of vignetting from the filter.  Next time, I will use the 62mm filter on that 52mm lens.I'll post more images in Part 2, as well as shots from nearby Grand Mere State Park."},
{"title": "The Yashica Lynx 5000", "date": "Monday, February 27, 2012", "text": "No, that's not the name of a NASCAR race.  Yashica is well-known for its plethora of 35mm rangefinder cameras in the 1960s and 70s.  These metal-bodied cameras usually have 45-50mm lenses and plenty of glass -- usually a minimum of f/1.8.  There are a bewildering variety of models, starting with the Minister,  Lynx, and of course, the series of Electro 35 cameras.  The Electro 35 models tend to be somewhat larger and heavier than the Lynx models.  Some take odd-sized mercury cells, and others take alkaline cells.  Some are semi-automatic, depending on a working battery to operate, and others, such as the Lynx, can operate independent of a battery.  With these aging cameras, it's often a matter of luck in finding one that works properly.  In my case, I was at a local consignment shop and saw the Lynx 500e.  It was in a case, and though it appeared to be in good shape, the batteries in the battery compartment had badly oxidized.  However, the shutter speeds and apertures appeared to be good, so I paid the $40 for it.Once I got it home, I cleaned it up a bit.  I cleaned out the battery compartment.  The camera takes two PX-640a cells, which can be found online or at a battery store.  I decided to not spend any money on the cells until after I could test the electronics.  I haven't done that yet, as the camera works great manually.  The model I have is the Lynx 5000e, which was made between 1963 and 1966. It features a 45mm f/1.8 lens -- plenty fast enough for a rangefinder camera, and a shutter speed range from B to 1/1000 sec.  That's an excellent range for a leaf-shuttered camera.  The Lynx 5000 takes 46mm screw-on filters, and it just so happens that I have a bunch. There is no hot-shoe, but it does have a pc flash connector on the front. In the test shots that follow, I used my intuition for the exposure, and am quite pleased with the results on Kentmere 400 film.  Although not too arty, the images do show the lens is sharp and focused correctly.    I really like the size and handling of the Lynx 5000e.  One nice feature is that if one sets a particular shutter speed and aperture combination for a given exposure value, the rings can rotate together to give you a series of combinations of aperture and shutter speed based on the same EV.  I find that to be a very useful option, especially on a manual camera.  I'll give the camera a whirl with color film soon and see how things go.  I certainly recommend the Lynx 5000, and if you look around, be aware that there is a Lynx 14 -- boasting the fastest lens on a compact leaf-shutter camera -- a 45mm f/1.4 Yashinon."},
{"title": "Got film, comrade?", "date": "Sunday, February 19, 2012", "text": "Earlier this year, I received a small package from my Flickr contact, Larry Dressler.  Larry's into trying out all sorts of odd b&w films, and he had sent me a few rolls of Kodak Varicath microfilm to try out.  Also in the package was a roll of Svema film.  It was Svema 65, which expired the year I graduated from High School -- 1975!  I figured that I might as well give it a try, seeing as how I have shot so many rolls of other long-expired films.  Larry suggested shooting it at an ISO rating of 25, which made sense seeing as how old it was.  I decided that the best choice of a camera to shoot it with than my Soviet-era Fed 5 rangefinder!  Heroes of the Revolution.  Well, one of them is.  That is a small pin honoring Yuri Gagarin next to the film box.If you have never seen a roll of 35mm Svema film before, it's a best to make sure that you DO NOT open the box in daylight and most importantly, do not open the foil package unless you are in the darkroom or using a changing bag.  The film is not in a canister!  You need to load the film into a 35mm cassette to use it.  Either the Svema folks were incredibly \"green\" in making you reuse 35mm cassettes, or they were incredibly cheap.Check out the expiration date!I shot some of the film at Toledo at the Toledo Art Museum, and about a month later finished it up at Parker Mill park off Geddes Road.  After looking up some information on the web, I decided to develop the Svema film in Rodinal at 1:25 for 6.5 minutes.  ResultsThe film's information on the rebate developed normally, and there is a lot of base fog.  Shooting at an ISO of 30 was actually way off.  I should have tried shooting at an ISO of about 10!  The film's sensitivity was way down, and the negatives that I scanned were mostly quite faint.  Some time exposures that I guesstimated were actually pretty good (probably 8 seconds at f/11). The shots from Toledo were quite faint, but scanning them in worked pretty well.  Without further ado, here are some samples...It was fun trying a film that had withstood the latter part of the cold war, Perestroika, and the fall of the USSR. The Svema factory was located in the Ukraine, but it became a victim of opening up to the West.  Kodak and Fuji films became available and the factory closed by the turn of the century."},
{"title": "Working A Scene", "date": "Sunday, February 05, 2012", "text": "Some questions I hear from aspiring photographers are: \"What should I photograph?\"  \"I don't know what to shoot, what should I do?\"  and \"How is a snap shot different from what somebody who's famous shot?\"I think I can answer all three of those questions with one sentence -- \"work a scene.\"  What do I mean by that?  Well, working a scene is something a good photographer does almost without thinking about it, but in reality, it means setting up a series of shots at a particular place to get a range of images.  Taken in their entirety, the shots may provide a lot of information about the scene, but each individual image provides a singular interpretation of the scene.  In fact, each image could be shot so differently that anyone seeing a series of prints later on, may not even know they are from the same place and time.  Working a scene means getting a number of images from a place, and each image may bear a serial relationship to the other taken before and after, or not.  But it's not a single photo of something that \"looked cool.\"    Thanks to the digital cameras that we have today, one can \"work a scene\" almost to death, experimenting with different effects, lenses, saturation, etc., and see the results immediately on the LCD screen.  That's not a bad thing, as I think one benefit of digital photography is that it allows for exploration with immediate feedback as to what's working. You can work a scene with film, too. If you are serious about photography, working a scene is done almost unconsciously.  However you photograph, no matter with film or digital, it pays to explore a scene and sometimes you will end up with images that you had not expected to take.This morning, I anticipated that we would have some hoarfrost, so I grabbed my camera backpack with my Nikon D90 and lenses, and headed out to my vehicle (I always keep my tripod on the rear floor in my Escape), and drove off to Buhr Park.  It's not far from my house, and I got there barely ahead of the sunrise.  I decided to use just the 85mm 1.8 AF-D Nikkor with the extra-long lens hood, as I wanted to shoot wide-open for some shots.  I have photographed the grove of apple trees in Buhr Park numerous times -- usually in fog, so I wanted some higher contrast scenes this morning and with the frost on the grass and the dark trees, I knew I would have some good opportunities for  that(we have barely had any snow this winter!).First of all, it's difficult to shoot into the sun, and you will get flare spots on your lens if you do.  However, with a scene so obviously monochromatic, the colorful flare spots gave the image an entirely different look. I suspect that the 85mm 1.8 Nikkor is more flare-prone, too.Shooting with the sun to the side and incorporating shadows from the raking light gives an altogether different interpretation of the scene. I also changed the image in PP to monochrome.Opening up the lens to f/1.8 will give an image the appearance of more depth - while shooting at f/16 will give more depth-of-field, it does not necessarily equal the appearance of greater depth. A narrow band of focus does that.Stopping down a bit to f/3.2, I wanted to use the sunlit side of the trees and the frosted grass.  Just enough blur of the trees in the far background make the foreground pop more.Lastly, a little PP work to give the scene a more Holga-like appearance.It's obvious by now that all of these images are from the same place, but each of them has a differently quality and interpretation.  That's working a scene (and working the brain).  You will improve your photography by shooting a lot -- that's the only way to do so."},
{"title": "Stocking Up as Kodak Reorganizes", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2012", "text": "A couple of weeks ago I placed an order from Freestyle Photo for 25 rolls of Kodak's Tri-X in 120 size, and 2 bulk rolls of 35mm.  That's 200 feet of Tri-X.  With all of the news coming out about Kodak's impending Chapter 11 filing, I felt that I should stock up, not because I thought Tri-X was going away, but the prices might go up due to uncertainty in the supply chain, as well as people cashing in on the fear of Kodak disappearing entirely.  As has been widely reported, Kodak claims that \"Film remains profitable.\"  It has to be, as Kodak can easily swamp suppliers if it wanted to, and charge even less for its product. It could also raise the price. I think Kodak's film business has probably subsidized its attempts to be a player in the printer market, among other things.   So, perhaps a \"film-only\" spinoff like Eastman Chemicals (also profitable) would be a good thing.  However, with Ilford (a dedicated b&w manufacturer), Fuji, Efke, Forte, and other film suppliers, black & white film isn't going away.  I don't know how the Chapter 11 reorganization will pan out, but I have enough Tri-X to last me  a year or two.  Maybe by the time I run out of my current supply, the \"Eastman Film Company\" will materialize and continue selling silver-halide products in a little yellow box like it always has.  A new website  -- Darkroom ResourcesThanks to the ease of putting up a web site under Google, I have built one that is intended to be a resource for users of expired films, papers, and discontinued products. It's also a source of documentation and techniques that have largely been lost in the transition to digital workflow.  Darkroom Resources is still under development, and I will be adding new material to it over the next few months.  Some of the documents are those that I inherited from Bill Brudon, and are not easily found in any archives, as they date well before the Internet!

I have been through way too many aged Pentax Spotmatics, Prrakticas, etc.  I had a manual for a Yashica TL Electro X in my collection of printed materials, so I decided to look for one on Ebay.  After some failed bidding attempts, I found a nice all-black model -- the latter version of the TL Electro with the atomic symbol on the front and the \"ITS\" designation.  It was $29.99 (buy it now) with free shipping so I purchased it.  The camera was even better-looking in front of me than it was on-line (which is not often the case).  It was advertised as \"100% working\" and it does, but it might be a while until I have fully trusted the meter reading.  However, the TL Electro X features: Stop-down metering Uses a currently available 6v battery Mirror-lockup ISO hot shoe + PC sync terminals Vertical traveling metal focal-plane shutter B - 1/1000 sec shutter speeds DOF preview battery-check buttonNow, those are fairly standard features, but not always the case for M42-mount cameras.  I shot a roll of Kodak Gold 100 the day I got the camera -- and it was an overcast afternoon by then.  However, I ventured out to Chelsea, MI to do some shooting to try out the camera.  One thing that took some getting used to is the exposure system. Exposure adjustment is indicated  by --> A few shots from the day...A bunch of creepy doll parts -- probably f/2 at 1/15 or 1/30 sec.An REO Speedwagon with \"rustic\" art bolted or welded on.  Not sure what to make of it, but the truck did run, and was quite a spectacle. Thankfully, it had a \"chase car\" as I am sure it wasn't going too fast. Milling about.  There are not many small towns anymore that have an industry still in town, next to other businesses and residential areas.  The Chelsea Milling Co., home of Jiffy Mix is right in downtown Chelsea, making for a scene that is nostalgic and yet contemporary. I thought the lens I used -- from an earlier Yashica purchase, the Yashica J-P -- is rather soft and not contrasty, so the next roll was shot with a Cosina 55mm f/1.7 lens, and I'll see how that performed after I develop the b&w film. Overall, this camera is a beauty, and works well. The price was a steal, and I look forward to using it with other M-42 lenses."},
{"title": "Pentax 6x7 on the street", "date": "Sunday, January 01, 2012", "text": "I have owned a Pentax 6x7 since about 2001.  It was given to me by my now-deceased mentor, Bill Brudon.  It is not a camera that I use frequently, but I go through periods when I use it a lot for a short period.  Mostly I use it on a tripod, as it's a pretty heavy beast, and that's one reason I don't use it for much than landscapes or portraits.  The last year saw me trying something different. I figured that it deserved a try as a \"street camera.\"  Now, it's way too big to be a discreet camera, but I did re-attach the strap so that it could easily be carried over a shoulder and used hand-held.  That means a film ISO of 400, so that I can shoot at higher shutter speeds. The mirror flip is loud, so this is not, I repeat, not a discreet camera!Back in November, Marc Akemann and I went on a day-trip to Fenton and Holly, MI.  The day was quite sunny, though the sun was getting low in the sky, causing long shadows.  I used a roll of 220 Kodak Portra 400 VC that  expired in 2007.  Frankly, I was a little disappointed in the results.  The shadows were really blocked up, so I probably won't use any more that film.  The one thing that I had to be careful of is that the camera is easily banged into things, since it was hanging down from my shoulder, and the lens hood really sticks out.  I quickly got used to the heft of the camera, and it's like shooting a Pentax Spotmatic on steroids. Marc shooting with his trusty F100. His brother bought it for $25 at a yard sale.

This was taken in open shade, and the negative is lacking in contrast and seems underexposed. Mailboxes, Holly.  The 90mm lens is the \"normal\" lens for this camera, and vertical shots are fairly easy, as the camera has lots of \"grippable area.\"  The plus side of the 6x7 format is that it is a big negative.  Using 220, I can get 20 shots on a roll, which is a fair amount of shooting with a camera of this heft.  However,220 is getting hard to come by, so in the future, I'll stick to 120 rolls.  Some Kodak Tri-X will go for the next outing."},
{"title": "The Kodak Brownie Reflex", "date": "Tuesday, December 27, 2011", "text": "I have divested myself of most of my 127 film cameras, but the Kodak Brownie Reflex I have recently shot with is one that sat on a shelf for a number of years before I finally put some film in it.  I had a roll of 40+ year old Kodak Verichrome Pan in 127 size,(the best film ever for box cameras), so I figured that I may as well finally try out the Brownie.  While it looks much like a TLR, it's really just a box camera with a reflex (mirror) viewfinder.  My camera is a bit grungy on the viewfinder part, but the taking lens (a simple meniscus lens) is clear.  Note that the camera has I and B settings - for \"Instant\" and \"Bulb\".  The frames are square 4x4 cm, with 12 exposures on a roll.  The model I have is the \"synchro\" version, made from 1941-1952, meaning that it accepts a clip-on flash unit. The body is mostly made of black bakelite, and it really is a stylish box camera, complete with neck strap. I started the roll of VP127 back in June, when my daughter Jorie and I went on a photo safari to Indiana, and finally finished the roll yesterday by taking some shots in Ann Arbor.  I developed the film in Kodak DK-50 1:1 for 6 minutes.  That particular developer seems to work really well with old Verichrome Pan. I like the square format, and considering the age of the film AND the age of the camera, the results are pretty decent. The theater in Angola, Indiana. June 2011.  Decatur, IN., June 2011.The railroad trestle near Argo dam, Ann Arbor. 12/26/2011.  Note that this, the last image on the roll, is quite free from the markings found on the beginning of the roll.  I might shoot 127 more often if it were not for the fact that the only b&w film is Efke, and that 127 film is a pain to scan, as there are no film holders for it.  However, I certainly have enough 120 and 35mm cameras to use, and 127 remains a rarely-used format.  At one time, it was quite popular, and pretty much died out as a consumer film once Kodak brought out the Instamatic cartridge in 1963. There are still some beautifully-made 127 cameras that are worth trying -- the Sawyers 127 TLR, the mini Rollei, and the Ricoh Super-44. Such compact TLR cameras are fun to use, and produce excellent results."},
{"title": "Retina IIa Review", "date": "Sunday, December 11, 2011", "text": "If you are a collector of cameras, or a user of vintage cameras, there is one model that you should own -- the Kodak Retina IIa.  You really would be hard-pressed to find another camera that fits in a pocket, has an all-metal construction, completely manual, and has a 50mm 2.0 Xenar lens. First, a little bit about the Retinas.  With the exception of the Kodak Ektra, The Bantam Special,  Medalist, Chevron, and the Super Kodak Six-20, Kodak's premier  metal-bodied cameras came out of the Nagel factory in Stuttgart, Germany. Eastman Kodak purchased the Nagel Kamerawerk in 1932, which became Kodak A.G.  The first camera from the factory to use 35mm film was the Retina I, which appeared in 1934.  A long series of cameras with the Retina (and lower-priced Retinette)designation appeared, ending with the Retina Reflex Instamatic camera in the 1974. While other Retina models followed the IIa with advances such as meters, better rangefinders, and interchangeable lens elements, I think the IIa best embodies what makes a pocketable 35mm camera of its combination of quality and features. The strut-mounted lens allows the cover to collapse over it, protected from just about anything.  The Schnieder Xenon f/2.0 lens in a Compur shutter with speeds from B to 1/500 sec., with X flash synch is excellent.  The Retina IIa was sold from 1951-1954, meaning my two examples are both nearing 60 years old.  Yet, the smooth operation of the camera and near-silent shutter is far better than many cameras of more recent vintage.  The Retina IIa also features a \"cold shoe\" for use with an external flash (using a PC synch connector near the edge of the lens), or one could possibly use an external albada viewfinder for easier framing.  Like many of its contemporaries, the Retina IIa viewfinder is rather squinty.  Glasses-wearers are always at a disadvantage with the small viewfinders.   The RF focusing patch works pretty well, except in low light situations, such as when I took these flash shots at a recent Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club meetup at the Wolverine tap room. I used a small flash bracket and a modern Sunpak flash with a diffuser.  The flash was set on Auto, and the camera was set at f4 and 1/50 sec to catch ambient light in the background.  The beauty of a Compur leaf shutter is that the flash syncs at every speed.  This shot by Ross Orr with his Fuji 6x9 (Texas Leica) and Tupperware flash shows me with my Retina IIa setup: (photo courtesy of Ross Orr)This camera has the name \"Edgerton\" inscribed front and back.  I bought this camera at an estate sale of a long-time collector in the Detroit area.  I often wonder if Harold Edgerton had previously owned the camera. That would be pretty darn cool.  My other Retina IIa was given to me by Bill Brudon in 2001, and that one is in even better shape, but the rangefinder needs to be adjusted.  Finally, a few samples of the shots taken with the setup described above, using Kentmere 400 b&w film:"},
{"title": "35mm Stealth - The Olympus Trip 35", "date": "Sunday, December 04, 2011", "text": "Olympus has long made some legendary cameras.  While the OM-1 and its descendents qualify as some of the great compact 35mm SLRs of all-time, some \"lesser\" cameras are deserving of cult status.  Consider the Olympus Trip 35 -- Not a whole lot to adjust.  It needs no batteries, as a selenium cell surrounds the front of the lens.  There are two shutter speeds - 1/40 sec and 1/200 sec, as the camera operates in \"A\" mode unless you set it for flash (at 1/40 sec).  A zone focus camera, you can see where you have it set for via a small window that shows in the viewfinder.  A thumb wheel advances the film.  The shutter is pretty silent.  In terms of a \"stealth camera\" - this one really fits the  description.  The 40mm f/2.8 Zuiko lens focus from about 3 feet to infinity, and is a Tessar design.   The ISO range adjusts from 25 to 400.  There is a PC socket and an ISO hot-shoe for flash.  Some limitations, to be sure, but I have seen some really fine images taken with the Trip 35.  Of course, the camera has a durable metal body and very classic styling.  I think it's one of those under-rated cameras that have achieved cult status simply by doing a pretty decent job with minimal controls.  A minimalist street camera that has  auto-exposure.  Not too shabby.I haven't shot much with the one that I have, and that's probably just because I have too many cameras to give every one of them a lot of use.  If you find one for sale, test the electronics by opening the back and pointing the camera toward a shaded area.  If it's all working correctly, the lens ought be be wide open where it's darker and at its minimum in the sun.   Here are a few images from mine.  Stocking up.WallflowersConstruction at workHow does the camera stack up with an even smaller camera such as the XA?  The XA has a slightly wider field of view, is more compact, but depends on a battery for the shutter to operate.  The Trip 35 has a more classic rangefinder styling, and looks remarkably a lot like the new digital Olympus Pen series.  If you find one, have fun using it.  Maybe you'll surprise yourself at how capable the camera really is."},
{"title": "The Film Rollercoaster", "date": "Wednesday, November 23, 2011", "text": "The past few weeks have seen a lot of postings on various forums about Kodak dropping various films, the discontinuation of Kodak's Plus-X,  good announcements on  new products from Harman-Ilford, and the usual speculation about the role of film in the movie industry.   With all these things in mind, maybe it is time to list them and provide some good links and commentary about the roller coaster we have been on the past few months.A shot from a few years ago, with many expired films!The Good and Bad (you decide)Kodak's new Portra 400.  Fine-grained, superb latitude -- maybe the best C-41 color film ever.  Pushing Portra: from the folks at the Film Photography PodcastUseful reviews: photomfarebophotography figitalrevolutiontwinlenslifeA new pinhole camera from Harman, with a DIRECT POSITIVE paper from Ilford.  I really want to buy some of that 4x5 positive paper as soon as it is in stock.  Nice video review here.Kodak's discontinuation of Plus-X -- a great summation of this by my friend Ross Orr on his blog.To be honest, Plus-X was never my \"favorite,\" and in medium format, I really think Verichrome Pan is the one film that I miss.   However, it did offer a decent medium-speed solution and an \"old-style\" look.  Tmax 100 is a \"better\" film, and uses less silver, so I can see why Kodak would drop Plus-X.  If you want a good Plus-X replacement, try Ilford's FP-4+ (which I always liked better).  If you are interested in how Kodak produces its film -- this book is for you!Digital Cinema is making inroads that will possibly eviscerate movie film sales in the coming few years.  This article has some interesting information. That's on top of the fact that companies that make professional movie cameras are now stopping that...   One can argue that there are likely to be a lot of used cameras available for quite a while, but the writing is on the wall for those people.   On a bright note, however, Lomography has introduced a new camera that allows you to produce short movies using conventional 35mm film - the Lomo Kino.   I was at first a bit skeptical, but after seeing what some very creative people have done, I think it's a really cool, retro, and creative tool that will attract quite a bit of interest.    I have to hand it to Lomography -- they do have the ability to think \"different.\"  Maybe they should buy the Kodak film business?So, you want to try a different B&W film?  ORWO sells in the USA:$40 for 100 feet of 35mm is pretty decent.  I hope someone gets a roll to test it out and post their results.Not sure if I care about this -Kodak is ceasing production of KODAK PROFESSIONAL ELITE Chrome 100 Film by year end 2011.Kodak's dropping of Elitechrome doesn't matter to me.  I so rarely have a reason to shoot transparency films anymore, since digital accomplishes tasks that I used to use  transparency films for - macrophotography, dragonfly and other insect images, images for work, color landscape work, etc.   (and obviously 90% of the former users of slide film have switched). I might use a roll from time to time in my medium-format cameras, or tungsten film to be cross-processed.  Given that there are no reliable local E-6 labs, everything has to be mailed out, too.   However, if you find yourself shooting transparency film, Kodak recommends suggested replacement is the E100G 135-36 or Elite Chrome 100 Extra Color / EBX 135-36. Clarification from KodakKodak isn't dropping these films -- they are just changing the packaging and how they are marketed.T-Max 400 120, will now be sold in \"propacks\" of five rollsTri-X Pan 120 400 films will also be packaged in propacks of five rollsKodak's Max 400 rolls of 12 exposures will cease to be offered, with the firm choosing to only market rolls of 24 frames. These rolls will be available to purchase in packs of four in the US, and in singles and packs of three throughout the rest of the world.BW400cn packs of three rolls will now only be sold in single packs.Read more from the British Journal of Photography and Unique Photo. Does any of this mean that you should be concerned with obtaining film for your cameras? No.   If you have been buying your 35mm film at Walgreens or some other store, well, I have news for you.  Stop that at once and purchase film from a local photography retailer (if you have one), or go online to Freestyle Camera, Adorama, B&H, Ultrafine Online, and a number of other places.  Heck, go to Urban Outfitters and buy film repackaged by Lomo.  You'll have many choices at these stores, and the opportunity to try some films you may never have even heard of before. What you find in the department or drug store has no bearing on what's really available out there."},
{"title": "The Olympus Macro Stand + bellows", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2011", "text": "Back in early October I picked up an Olympus macro photography stand with the matching bellows for an Olympus  OM-series camera.    It's quite similar (but better-constructed) than the Minolta macro set-up that I used to own.  I rarely use film for macro-photography anymore, but at a price of $25, I could not pass up the Olympus macro stand.  As you can see in the photograph, I have it it set up with my OM-1 and a 50mm 3.5 Olympus macro lens.  By itself, the lens does 1/2 size (1:2) maximum magnification.  With a typical set of extension tubes, one can go a little larger than 1:1 (life size).  With a bellows, you can go several times life size, if you want to shoot small objects, or magnify parts of larger subjects.  The problem with a bellows and extension tubes, is that the working distance (the distance from the front of the lens to the subject) is very small -- from a few inches to fractions of an inch, depending on the extension.  In addition, there is significant light falloff, shallow depth of field (DOF) and movement is magnified.  So, the easy way to avoid some of the drawbacks is to use the camera like a microscope, by keeping the assembly locked down to a solid rail as you can see here.  Typically, one would use a ringlight or a couple of small flashes near the subject for great DOF at f/16 or f/22 and to avoid camera shake.  However, you can also use fiber-optic lights, and other high-intensity LED lights to get proper lighting at these close distances.The other thing to note is that there are two remote-release cables.  One is for the lens (to activate the aperture prior to making the exposure, and the other operates the camera shutter.  That is typical for bellows, as the lens is not linked to any actuating mechanism on the camera body.I took a few shots with the OM-1, and here is the side of the thorax of a Canada darner dragonfly.  I would imagine that if you had an OM-series adapter for your DSLR or Olympus Pen (digital), it would be a great way to shoot small things.  Macrophotography is one of the great things about shooting digital!"},
{"title": "Camera Porn! - 500 Cameras by Todd Gustavson", "date": "Saturday, November 05, 2011", "text": "I was at my local Barnes & Noble bookstore and picked up this book for $15.96 (hardcover!). 500 Cameras is a wonderful book for anyone that loves the history of photography, old cameras, or just likes looking at and reading about beautiful mechanical things.  This is Mr. Gustavson's second book on the subject, a sort of pared-down version of his 2009 book \"Camera: A History of Photography from Daguerreotype to Digital.\" All of the cameras featured in 500 Cameras are from the George Eastman House Collection in Rochester, NY, where Mr. Gustavson is a Curator of Technology.   While not an exhaustive guide such as McKeowns' Price Guide to Antique and Classic Cameras (2006), this book covers the evolution of cameras and all of the examples are beautifully photographed in color.  Some of the cameras from the GEH Collection were formerly owned by famous photographers, are rare examples, or historically significant examples in the evolution and development of photography and technology.  I can't think of a better gift for anyone that loves old cameras, and as I state at the top, this is pure camera porn.  If you don't live near a B&N, Amazon also sells this book, for just a bit more.  It's a nice addition to my library, and while I don't have the camera collection I once had, this book makes me glad I didn't decide to collect wood view cameras, or Kodak folding cameras.  That would be a never-ending quest, and believe me, this book takes up MUCH LESS space than 500 cameras. So, sit back with a copy of this book and enjoy some beautiful camera porn and interesting stories about 500 cameras.500 Cameras, by Todd Gustavson.  2011.

{"title": "The Yashica J-P -- a middle-aged SLR", "date": "Sunday, October 30, 2011", "text": "Back in mid-September I purchased a bit ratty-looking Yashica J-P SLR when I was in Kenton, OH.   I paid ten dollars, which I felt was a fair price, given it's condition.  After I got it home, I cleaned it up, and ran it through some dry-firing.   It seemed to work okay, although sometimes the mirror wanted to hang a bit after the shutter fired.    Unlike the later Yashica SLRs, the early models such as the J-P had the \"standard\" M-42 screw thread lens mount.  That mount was used in a variety of cameras in the 1960s and into the 1970s.  Pentax, Praktica, Ricoh, Fuji, Cosina, Mamiya, Olympus (before the OM-series),  Zenit, and a number of re-badged models, such as Argus, Vivitar, Sears, etc., all had the M-42 mount.  While not exactly the swiftest mount for a lens-change, it was a stable mount that had a whole truckload of lenses and accessories that were pretty much interchangeable over a broad number of cameras.  A number of manufacturers then changed to more proprietary bayonet lens mounts, and Yashica went to the Contax-Yashica mount (C-Y) in 1975 with the introduction of the FX-1.   The J-P is a no-frills SLR with the maximum shutter speed at 1/500 second.  It does not have TTL metering (that came out with the TL-Super in 1967), but it does have an attachment point for a clip-on external meter that couples to the shutter speed dial.  The cloth horizontally-traveling shutter is pretty standard for its time.  The lens is an AutoYashinon 5cm f/2.  While there is no cold-shoe or hot shoe for the flash, there are two PC contacts for X-sync and FP flashbulbs.    After I played with the camera a bit more, I realized that the frame indicator dial was stuck at 33, and the self-timer did not work.  Oh well, I decided to run a roll of somewhat expired XP-2 film through it.  It took a bit of getting used to having the shutter button on the front of the camera, but overall, the camera was fine after I got used to its few quirks.  I took it to downtown Ann Arbor and also up to the UP in early October.  Here are a few resulting shots: Jorie at the shore near Christmas, MI.  The Neutral Zone in Ann Arbor - a place for teens to hang out and be creative. Things go better with Coke. Rocks and water.I basically used the \"sunny-16\" exposure guide for shooting with the camera, as I often did not have an external meter with me.   Based on my experience with this Yashica, I am tempted to try a TL-Electro if I ever see one at a cheap price.  The lenses in these Yashicas are excellent, and despite the seeming awkwardness of the shutter button (note that there is a reason why they are usually on the top deck of the camera), the camera worked fine for its age and condition.   For those with a penchant for M-42 lenses and cameras, the Pentax Spotmatics are not the only game in town.  There are a number of good to great SLRs from others that can often be had for the price of a meal at a fast-food restaurant.  Scary.  They were not cheap when they were introduced, and if you get one in good working order, it'll take photos just as well as anything else you can find."},

The official press release follows:The Argus Museum proudly presents Sunday Afternoon on the Porch: Reflections of a Small Town in Iowa, 1939-1942, photographs by Everett W. Kuntz. The exhibition runs from October 21st through November 18th, 2011.As a teenage farm boy in Ridgeway Iowa, in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Everett W. Kuntz, using the Argus AF camera he purchased for $12.50, captured images of everyday life near and around his hometown. He did not have the money to have the shots printed, and eventually, as he went off to college and later settled in Minneapolis, he forgot he even had them. Some 60 years later, as he lay dying of cancer, he remembered. \"He went to the basement and opened a box,\" said his son, David Kuntz. \"And there they were.\"In 2008, The University of Iowa Press published the photographs, which are accompanied by vignettes written by Jim Heynen. The book, as well as matted prints of Kuntz's images, may be purchased at the Museum for the duration of the exhibit.The opening will be held on Friday, October 21st from 6 to 9pm at the Argus Museum. The museum is located on the second floor of the Argus l building, 525 West William, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. The event is free and refreshments will be served. The musical performance of the Julian Allen Trio will add to the festivities. (The previously-recorded Ann Arbor-based group consisting of Marcus Elliot, Ben Rolston, and Julian Allen, finds relevance and inspiration through many musical forms and origins.) Kuntz's photographs will be exhibited October 21 through November 18th, Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm. For more information, please contact Cheryl Chidester at 734-759-0770 or email Cheryl at cchidester@onealconstruction.com. The event is supported by the family of Everett W. Kuntz, the Argus Collectors Group, Bill Martin, and O'Neal Construction. In addition, there is more:    Also on display will be artifacts from the Argus Museum collections. Products manufactured by the Argus Camera Company, including rare objects and prototypes, are featured, as well as military items and employees’ personal effects. Many of the artifacts on display were manufactured in the same building which now houses the Museum.    Former Argus employees and their families will be invited to the opening, giving those interested a chance to speak with them. Argus-related presentations are planned for Saturday, October 22nd, with an afternoon field trip to the Yankee Air Museum which will include a private tour and photography opportunities. (A $2.50 admission fee per person will be charged.) The Argus Museum Archives will open for research on Sunday, October 23rd. Reservations are required for Saturday and Sunday events. If you are interested in giving a presentation (it can be an informal one), please contact Cheryl Chidester.If you have any interest in vernacular photography, history, old cameras, and especially Argus, this will be a very fun event!  I'll be there Friday night."},
{"title": "October Splendor in the U.P.", "date": "Thursday, October 13, 2011", "text": "I was in Marquette from Oct. 6-9, in the midst of a heat wave.  It was something having temperatures around 80, and for the first time, I wished I had brought shorts with me.  I have been there in mid-summer when it was cooler.  However, it was nice having such fine weather without biting insects, and the angle of the sun made for some awesome shooting. The leaves were almost at their peak coloration, but I think the prolonged dry spell muted the colors.   I was able to get out and do a bit of shooting, and mostly used my recently-acquired Nikon F100 and my Hasselblad.  The Canon G11 got a pretty good workout, too, as it is prefect for hikes in the woods when I don't want to be burdened with a lot of gear.  I always like to visit Presque Isle Park in Marquette, and I am never disappointed with the potential for good shots there.  The more I visit it, the more interesting angles and viewpoints I see.The Black Rocks -- the oldest rock in Michigan.The last time I was there in late August, I photographed a wonderful sunset, and that's one of the really attractive aspects of being on the shore of Lake Superior - the skies are often just plain awesome -- whether day or night.  It's a real change being away from the city lights, and the plethora of jet trails that we have downstate.    Sunsets can seemingly go on forever, when you have the lake as the horizon.  This time though, I captured a sunset while walking the trail back to the place we own in Harvey.  It was a delightful sight.Adrienne and I explored a bit E of Harvey, on DNR land off Kawbawgam Trail -- there you'll find some pine plains with lots of blueberry, which was turning scarlet - making for some scenic roadsides.  I shot that area with my F100, and will get negaatives scanned in this weekend from that trip.  On Saturday, my daughter Jorie and I drove over to Christmas, which is just W of Munising.  There, we met up with a bunch of APUG photographers, and explored the sandstone cliffs that are just off 5-mile Point Road.  The drive in on the dirt road was a little wild, and when Jorie and I finally reached the parking area, we were stunned by the landscape along the shore.  Of course, just as I wanted to shoot more of the scene there, the G11 battery died, and I had forgotten to charge the second battery.  Therefore, most of the shots taken there were with the Hasselblad and the F100.  Good for film!  The 'blad does not need batteries.  I'll know what I got from the hassy this weekend when I develop the film.  The rocks there often slope very subtly into the lake, and as a result, there are many really accessible places that let us get right down to the lake, and we saw some really neat little \"pools\" in the rocks that were filled with crystal-clear water.It's definitely a place that I want to visit more than once.On the way back home, Adrienne and I stopped at AuTrain Bay, which has a great sweep of sand between the outlet of the AuTrain River and Lake Superior.  It's the first time that I have shot there, and the light was again, really nice.It's always a creative boost for me when I visit the UP.  It's hard to leave for home."},
{"title": "A Little Nikon FM Love", "date": "Saturday, October 01, 2011", "text": "Back in April I blogged about buying Jeff Lamb's Nikon FM and have been using it periodically since then.  I have been pleased that it works smoothly, and meters as it should.  Back in mid-August, I did some night shots with it, as well as a variety of shots with different lenses - all on expired Kodak Gold 400 film.  I expected things to be a bit grainy, and they are.  I might as well put some shots up here to give you a feel for the expired film, and some decent results from this camera, too.  This table scene was early evening at Mike and Sarah's place, and I was using the Series E 50mm 1.8 lens.  Obviously it does not close-focus as much as I would like, but it does a pretty decent job, and was wide-open here. One of the things for you new digital to film converts is to remember that manual focus cameras like the Nikon FM are harder to focus in dim light, and that's where AF systems are often actually helpful.  This night scene was taken from the roof of a parking structure in downtown Ann Arbor.  As I was also using my Nikon D90, I estimated the exposure based on the D90 readings.    A bit grainy, but that's what to love about film being film, right? If I had used slide film, it would probably would have been \"cleaner\", but not as much dynamic range would be possible.Inside my garage, 24-50mm AF-D lens, and of course, a tripod.  That 24-50 lens is quickly becoming a favorite, as it covers the wide quite well, and ends at \"normal.\"   Shot here at the wide-end, of course.  That older bike is a Canadian-made CCM bike from the 1970s that I picked up ath the Recycle/ReUse center in Ann Arbor for $40.And here is the sign in front of the ReUse center... a place where I love to shop, and have picked up a few camera bargains, many books and things for the house there.  They have a frequent buyer program, but I never joined it, as I figure that I am already getting a bargain when I buy things there.  Last -- here is a shot of an umbrella sedge in a planter in front of the UM Museum of Art.  I finally found an angle to show the plant structure without any extraneous background clutter.  Again, this is the 24-50mm lens.  The thing to remember in these shots is that I did use expired 400 ISO film, which will give less than optimal results.  I try and stick with Kodak Gold 100 if I am shooting color, or if doing something special, Ektar 100.  I have some Fuji Reala and Superia for a trip up N next week, so expect some good fall color shots from those.  The thing I like about the Nikon FM is it's simplicity and durability.  It really does not get in the way of making a photograph."},
{"title": "NW Ohio Trip Part 3.", "date": "Friday, September 30, 2011", "text": "I had thought that I'd covered my trip pretty well, but realized that I hadn't included any FILM images.  In addition to the D90, I shot XP-2 film in my Nikon N8008 and Holga 135BC, and Tri-X in my Hasselblad.  I haven't finished the roll in the Holga yet, but here are a few images from the Nikon N8008 (by the way, it's a highly capable AF SLR that easily uses and meters with manual lenses,  unlike the other \"non-Pro\" AF bodies from Nikon -- and they are about $30 at KEH, run off 4 AA batteries for a long time, and a great bargain...)We encountered this unusual cantilever-style parking structure -- the full frontal view at 24mm shows how wacky it looks.There are lots of alleyways and sides of buildings with some really vintage iron stairs- most of which are the same style, suggesting that there was some preferred vendor back in the late 1800s-early 1900s when these buildings were built.  In one instance you can see where the lower part was removed and replaced with a cheaper, utilitarian style. This is a good example of how tastes and expectations change in a city, as well as how much money an owner is willing to put into a property.  It would probably be nearly impossible to duplicate the older style without spending a fortune.  I like it when a city decides it is worthwhile to invest in creating gathering spots downtown.  Having some tables and benches to encourage eating a lunch outside, meeting up with friends, or just watching the cars pass by is important to keeping a place lively. Of course, nobody was sitting there when I made the shot, but there were people there later during the noon-hour.  It's nice to see a small city like Findlay with a growing arts community.  For one thing, loft space is likely to be cheaper there than some other places, and if you can't go up, you can always go downstairs...That concludes images from Findlay, and that makes 6 blog posts for the month of September -- am unusually large number for me.   Next up will be an essay about Walker Evans and my homage project, as well as more vintage camera reviews.  See you in October."},
{"title": "NW Ohio Road Trip -- Part 2", "date": "Monday, September 26, 2011", "text": "After we left Findlay, we took route 68 towards Kenton.  I had heard that there was a major haul of photographic gear and images, books etc. there, and that the place might be open.   But first, I decided we would go S to Mt. Victory, and check that town out, as I had photographed the mill there in 2005.  We eventually got there, as I had forgotten that route 68 went to the SW, and we had to cross over to 31 from another road, bringing us into Mt. Victory from the South-- which was actually a good way to go, as the countryside there is quite scenic.  Like I said, I last shot there in 2005, and got some great shots of the grain elevators there, as the light was perfect (June vs September!):This time, the light was not there for good shots of the elevators, but there was more to see than that.  It's a great place to go antique shopping, as there are many antique stores there with some pretty cool stuff.  On the way N on 31 to Kenton, we stopped at a restored Gulf service station, owned by Mike Trout.  He gave us a tour of the inside, and it was fantastic -- he has collected Gulf memorabilia for years, and he bought the dilapidated service station and fixed it up to store and exhibit his collections.  It's based on a late 1930s station, and  it is worth a stop.Finally, we got into Kenton around 3:30 or so, and quite by accident, found the building where the camera stuff was located. Abby asked two teens on the stoop of a building if they were from the area, and if they knew anything about a lot of camera gear.. it so turned out the the boy's father was the person with all the stuff, and he just happened to be behind the door in front of us! Serendipity rears its head once again.    The story is that Dan Hausman and Tim Carrig bought out a large photographic collection from an estate in Pennsylvania.  It filled an 18 ft truck and a van, which they, and others have been picking through in this building in Kenton.  It's all in various states of condition, and of course, like many such \"finds\" - much of it is in untold boxes of stuff that could be nothing more than cheap plastic premium cameras, or maybe something quite desirable, such as a Leica.  So, it's hard to look at anything without having to look through an entire box.  Tim and Dan have been through most of it, and despite the apparent disarray of things, seemed to know what was there to some degree, and have probably already weeded out the real gems already.  This reminded me somewhat of the John Naslanic estate that I helped with back in 2007, but even then, the Kenton stuff was small compared to Naslanic's hoard of photographica.  I didn't go with any intent of buying anything -- I was just curious to see what was there.  I did end up buying a Yashica J-P SLR (made in 1964) for $10, thus having something to show for the trip down there.  A few shots of some of the stuff there...If you are interested in having a look, contact Tim via email at tim@golden-graphics.com - you'll need to let him know in advance, because he is not at the place every day, and it's not exactly a store.Well, that's all for now.  I'll have a separate article on the Yashica J-P."},
{"title": "A Short Ohio Road Trip - Part 1.", "date": "Monday, September 19, 2011", "text": "On Saturday, my friend Abby Alvarez and I went for a drive into NW Ohio, driving first to Findlay, and then to Mt. Victory, and back to Kenton, with many small towns in between.  I think of such trips as fishing expeditions, one never knows what the catch will be.  First of all, Findlay grew a lot during the late 1800s when petroleum was found in the area.  It's the seat of Hancock County, and Marathon Petroleum still has a commanding building on Main street.  However, there is a manufacturing industry in the area, and unlike many Michigan towns, it seems to be diversified in its economy.  There are many really nice homes on the main streets -- some very beautiful Victorian painted ladies, and those alone call for another visit.  We arrived in late morning, and parked on a side street after driving around a bit, to see where we should start out with our cameras.  We walked across the street, and Abby spied some cameras in a shop window, and I noted some collectible-type things inside, as well, and then I recalled that Matt Marrash of the Film Photography Project had interviewed a woman in Findlay.  I had no sooner had that thought when a woman came out of a shop next door, and started talking to us, and opened the door of the place we were looking into - it was her!  Leslie Hunsberger, herself.  We had a good laugh about that and that we have both been interviewed on the Film Photography Project's Podcast.  It was fun discussing photography with Leslie, and how young people are taking up film photography.  Leslie consented to being photographed while holding her favorite Polaroid camera (which she did use on the street that day).After that, Abby and I walked the back alleys, and streets in search of subjects, which were abundant.  I mostly shot with my Nikon D90, but also used my Nikon N8008 with XP-2, and my Holga 35BC with XP-2.  There were lots of interesting details, some odd buildings, signs, and in general, many new things to shoot and add to our respective collections of images.  As the day wore on, we sought lunch, and had a good one at Logan's Irish Pub.   As we traveled about, I kept seeing murals on brick walls in every town that we explored. Some are very complex, and I photographed every one I saw.  That could obviously be a theme for a show all by itself.  The Veteran's memorial in downtown Findlay. The back of a bank in downtown Findlay.  It's almost hard to tell where reality begins.Mt. Victory, OH Kenton, OH - Apparently the Gene Autry cap gun saved Kenton during the Great Depression.  Quite the mural! Late in the day, and almost sunset - we were driving back and saw this in Oakwood, OH -- a bar called the Landing Strip (not to be confused with the strip club near Detroit of the same name!).There is a lot more to show from this trip to NW Ohio, and that will have to wait for part 2.   Be ready for some hardware images :)"},
{"title": "Pinholery! A New DIY Book on Pinhole Cameras.", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "text": "I was at the local Barnes and Noble boostore last weekend, and found a new book on pinhole photography that might just be the most useful one that I have seen.  Chris Keeney's \"Pinhole Cameras - A Do-It-Yourself Guide\" is a well-presented guide to making your own pinhole cameras from a variety of containers.  He does not leave anything to chance, and provides all the steps necessary for the un-schooled and un-skilled to make their own pinhole cameras.  It's easy for some of us to forget that not everyone is mechanically inclined, and the author provides a great cookbook-style guide for pinhole camera making.  In fact, like some cookbooks, the book is wire-bound inside the hard cover, meaning it lays flat, making it far more useable on the workshop table while attempting to make a camera.The author also covers the basics of film and paper negatives, how to develop your own exposures, and includes a glossary of terms for the newcomers. He even shows all that one needs for a simple \"darkroom.\"  I think this book will be great for anyone who hasn't yet attempted to make a pinhole camera but feels daunted by the whole process -- as simple as it may seem -- there are still some things that one needs to know to be successful.    For those not into using film, Keeney provides information on using a body cap with a pinhole for your DSLR.  In short, an enjoyable book that will be quite useful for anyone that is considering playing with pinhole cameras.Book info: Keeney, Chris. 2011.  Pinhole Cameras: A Do-It-Yourself Guide.

{"title": "The Ricoh SLX-500", "date": "Tuesday, September 06, 2011", "text": "A recent eBay purchase, the Ricoh SLX 500 is a solid 35mm SLR with limited choice of shutter speeds, featuring an all-black metal body, a hot-shoe, PC flash connector, stop-down metering, and an M-42 lens mount.  It was introduced in the mid-1970s as a cheap beginner SLR, and also takes a Mercury battery.  The camera I bought is in excellent cosmetic shape, and the Ricoh 50mm f/2 lens seems plenty sharp.  Unfortunately, the meter is wonky, as the needle really jumps around so much as to be unreliable, so I used the camera with an external light meter.   I had to replace the mirror bumper foam and the light seals on the back, or risk black gooeyness.  As a note - before using any older SLR camera, check the mirror foam and back light seals before using.  Chances are, the camera will need things replaced about 90% of the time. The hardest part is removing the old stuff, but it should take anyone less than an hour to do this.  The M-42 mount gives one the opportunity to use a slew of various old lenses from Pentax, Cosina, Ricoh, Fuji, Meyer-Optik, Carl-Zeiss Jena, and others.  The shutter speed choices are limited to B, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/250, 1/500 sec. , which isn't bad, as compared to something like an Argus C-4.   From what I could find out, the original cost in 1976 was about $250 with the standard lens.    The SLX-500 doesn't seem to have had the production run of cameras like the Singlex and Singlex II -both of which I owned at one time, nor does it have as meany features.  It appeared at about the time the M-42 mount was being phased out in favor of the K-mount, and within a few years, a plethora of 35mm SLRs at competitive  prices would be flooding the market.  However, it IS a basic SLR, and despite the limited range of shutter speeds, it should be adequate for a lot of photography.  I loaded mine with the old standby - Kodak Gold 100, and sunny-16 for exposure guide.  For most of the shots I used the Rikenon 50mm 2.0 lens.  Like a lot of cameras from the 1970s, it's well-built, can be used as a weapon, and a battery is needed only for the meter."},
{"title": "The Great Wall PF-1 SLR", "date": "Thursday, September 01, 2011", "text": "Back in early July I won an auction on eBay for a new Great Wall PF-1, paying $59 for it.  I was actually surprised that I got it at the starting bid, as they routinely sell for about $100 new.  Considering that Dianas and such go for about $60, it's a pretty good deal.  One might wonder why I would bother buying this camera which features:-One shutter speed (I think)-Non-interchangeable lens-Cheesy pop-up flash -Suspect manufacturing quality-Optics by who knowsIn short, a crappy SLR!  Right up my alley!  Since receiving it from Ultrafine Online (and yes, they are still selling them on their website) in July, I have been shooting with it, getting to know it better, and figuring out its little quirks.  The camera is actually a copy of a Fujica ST-F from the mid-1970s, though I suspect the Fujica actually has a metal chassis, not all-plastic like the Chinese copy.    I did some searching online to see who's been shooting with the PF-1, and found a few galleries on the Lomography site and some on Flickr.  Not a whole lot, but the results didn't seem too bad.  The PF-1 features a thumb wheel to advance the film, like a cheap P&S, not an SLR.  Actually, it works quite whell as the operation is pretty smooth and not noisy. The camera requires 2 AA batteries for operation, for the meter and the flash.   The metering appears to be a CdS cell on the front of the lens bezel, much like rangefinders from the 1970s. There are three adjustable ISO settings - 100, 200, 400.  The lens is a 40mm 2.8, with a min. aperture of f/16.  There is a green/red LED for the metering, which seems to be accurate enough.    With a fixed shutter speed of 1/60th second (which seems pretty slow, as I would think that 1/100 would have been a better option), the PF-1 probably works best with ISO 100 film.  I recommend a neutral-density filter for ISO 400 film in bright sunlight.    The front of the lens takes 49mm filters, offering up possibilities for close-up, diffusion, polarizing, red, and any other filter that can be used, depending on film and what you want to do.My only real peeve about the PF-1 is that one really has to be careful when loading the film -- make sure that the film is pushed into the slot on the takeup spool as far as possible and that the film winds around before you close the back door.  It's possible for it to simply slip off and slide around inside if there isn't a positive capture.  It could also be a a manufacturing defect, with not all cameras being as quirky.  Once I realized how the film leader has to be \"properly\" inserted, my winding problems went away.The camera has a split-image center circle which greatly aids in focusing.  To use the meter, there is a silver button on the front that must be pressed while adjusting the aperture.  To use the flash, push the front of the flash up, and engage a lock on the side of the lens  that changes the aperture according to the distance focused on. This is much like the GN-Nikkor for the Nikon and the Canon QL-17, when using the matching flash unit.  There is a tripod socket, too.The camera comes in a box with an \"ever-ready\" case, neck strap, lens cap, and instructions in Chinese and \"English.\"    You can go to the Dot-Line website and download a pdf of their manual for the rebadged Aviva PF-1.  It's quite good.I loaded the camera with Tri-X for the first go-round, and many of the images were overexposed to some degree.  My next roll was Gold 100, but I goofed on the film loading and had numerous double exposures, and a half-blank roll.  Roll number 3 was respooled b&w, and the film pulled off the end of the roll when I wound one last time, and I opened the back... uh oh.  I have not developed that roll yet.  Roll 3 was Konica SRG 160 that was LONG expired.  I shot it as ISO 100, and got some nice grainy, muted images (see below).The last roll was Gold 100, and it fits very well with this camera when outdoors. Sure, it's a cheap SLR with a fixed lens.  It's fun to use, unassuming, and I like most of the results that I have gotten with it.  I wish it had a \"B\" setting and a hot-shoe, and all would be okay.  It does have a cable release socket, plus  a locking tab, so the shutter won't fire accidentally.  Is it worth $60?  Sure is.  Considering what a really plastic camera is going from the Lomography folks, this camera is a steal.    A pretty simple SLR that would be perfect for experimenting with, and adding various odd lens filters to see what happens.  There is a photographer on the Lomography site that shot a bunch of nudes with his PF-1.  Sort of strange, but if the models didn't laugh at his camera, then all is okay.   Should you buy this camera?  Sure.  It's a lot of fun.  I even created a group on Flickr for it."},
{"title": "Back in Marquette Again", "date": "Wednesday, August 24, 2011", "text": "About a year ago, I posted about my thoughts of my daughter and her partner leaving Marquette and coming down to live in Ann Arbor.  To be honest, I did not know when I would be returning to visit Marquette.  In May, my wife and I purchased a cottage along the Chocolay River in Harvey, about 4 mi. from downtown Marquette.  Jorie and Stephanie are now living there, and Adrienne and I have a place to stay when we visit.  It's not a big place -- less than 800 sq. ft., but it's in a beautiful location, and perfect for the the girls to live in.  It's also a fantastic base for me to stay at when I visit.  Marquette is jewel of a city -it's not the mining and shipping center that it once was, and has become a diverse city with an active urban center.   On top of that are the wonderful natural features of the Lake Superior shore, the surrounding highlands, and the rivers and streams that flow through it. In short, it's a great place to be, and I truly envy those that live up here year-round.  Maybe when I retire--it will be my next place to live.  Until that happens, I'll have to make the most of my visits here and have fun with photographing what interests me.\r\rSuch as last nights' sunset...\r Sunset over Lake Superior.\rI used my Nikon D70s for this, with a Tamron 28-200 ED lens.  I always shoot sunsets in Manual, as I want to control my exposure to reflect the actual scene as closely as possible."},
{"title": "Shades of Gray- Two New B&W Film Offerings from Lomography", "date": "Monday, August 15, 2011", "text": "Last month, I received an e-mail from a Lomography representative, asking if I was interested in writing something about the two new films being offered under the Lomography label -- \"Earl Grey\" and \"Lady Grey.\"   I offered to test the films and write up a short review about them.  But first, let me preface this review with some comments about the Lomography brand.\r\rThere are those people that completely dismiss Lomography as being some sort of cultish fad that preys on the hipster crowd.  There are others that drink the Lomography cool-aid and have no idea about other aspects of photography.  I think most people are somewhere in between.  I give the Lomography folks credit -- they have found a way to promote film cameras and film usage to a younger crowd that has grown up in the digital age, and along the way, have inspired some of this young talent to use film and embrace the  concept that fim is a versatile and creative tool.  Their products ARE fun - there is no doubt about that, and they have marketed their brand very well.  Lomography has brought back plastic cameras such as the Diana, and improved on the original design.  The company has come a long way from starting out as a subculture of Euro-centric film nuts, united with their love of the LOMO LC-A camera.  Flash forward to 10 years later, and Lomography products are in stores, catalogs, and of course, on the web in a big way.  The growth of their brand has increased as the usage of film has gone down.  So, despite some of the criticism leveled at Lomography, I think it's fair to say that the company has helped keep film alive, and introduce a new crop of young photographers to \"analogue photography.\" Of course, there will be some bumps in the road, but hopefully, my concerns below will be addressed. \rOkay, I promised a review, and not a history lesson.  \rThe package with the two boxes of film arrived -- and there were two 3-packs of 36 exposure film!  One was the Earl Grey - ISO 100 black & white film, and the other was the Lady Grey ISO 400 black & white film.  I'm not sure how they came up with these names, but I suppose someone thought it sounded cool.  Of course, there are not new films, nor are they made by lomography.  Both films are repackaged b&w film made by other companies. I'll get back to that under the review of each film.    My tests are made using the film in my typical shooting routine.  \rEARL GREY - This film is  100 ISO, and the box indicates that it is made in the Czech Republic.  From that, I deduced that it is Fomapan 100 film.   I don't think I have ever shot with any 35mm Foma films, but I have used their 120 in the past.   I loaded the film up in my Nikon FM2N and shot an entire roll in Dexter, MI one morning.    ISO was set at 100.  I used a 50mm f/2 Nikkor - the standard lens.   I developed in Kodak Tmax RS developer.  \rA few examples from the roll:\r\r\r\r\r\r\rLADY GREY - This appears to be Kodak T-Max 400, as the package indicated that the film was made in USA and packaged in Mexico.  The pink tint to the anti-halation layer is a good indication that I am right, as are the typical Kodak film cans.   I also used the FM2N, same lens, as well as a 28mm f/2.5 Vivitar and a 105mm  f/2.8 Nikkor lens.    Some images were shot in Dexter-Chelsea area and many shot in Fenton, MI a few days later.  The rolls I shot were also developed in Kodak T-Max RS developer. The edge markings merely have \"B&W 400\" along the film rebate.\rA few examples from the rolls I shot:\r\r\r\r\r\rOBSERVATIONS\r\rSince both of the films tested are standard b&w films, there really should be no surprises in the testing.  I think the Earl Grey is a bit contrasty - at least in the developer I used.  I'll try Rodinal the next time and how that compares.  I felt that the negatives were somewhat overexposed, but again, maybe it's the developer choice.  The Lady Grey was very good, with minimal grain and no surprises.  It looks like a T-grain film.  All of the negatives were scanned using my Minolta DualScan II with VueScan software, and levels adjustments were made in Paint Shop Pro on my Dell running Windows 7.  Either one of these films will be a good choice for general photography, and I'd be more apt to go with the Lady Grey, just because of the extra speed.  However, if the Earl Grey is supposed to be a contrasty film, it should be good for those wanting a more vintage look to their images.  I imagine it would be great for someone wanting to shoot \"Bettie Page\" type photos.  \r\rOne catch here -- since these are true B&W films and not C-41, Lomography needs to provide an obvious web address to link to developing information.  There are enough opportunities for novices to think that they can just take anything to the corner CVS/Walgreens/Target and get it developed.  Imagine their shock when the equally clueless lab tech develops the film in the C-41 chemistry and a blank roll results.  Not a good way to encourage people.  I could not find ANY developing information on the Lomography web site on my own, and the Lomography rep sent me the links when I inquired -- which are really buried in their site.  So, Lomography PLEASE make a better effort to (A) ensure that novice users do not mistake these films for C-41 monochrome and (B) print a web link on the boxes of film so that home developers can find the times and recommended developers.  Until that is done, nobody is going to know what to do with their Earl Grey or Lady Grey film after it has been shot.  I do recommend that photographers look at the Digital Truth site for the Fomapan 100 and T-Max 400 films.  \rThe web links for developing info from the Lomo site:\rEarl Grey\rLady Grey\r\rNow, it could be that because Lomography has given the above films their own names, it's not impossible that another manufacturer might be used, in which case, they would hopefully update their web site with the proper processing information.  \rFrom Earl Grey\r\rLomography might be the only way for some folks to try out traditional b&w films; but for the unknowing, the packaging should say (THIS IS NOT A C-41 FILM!). In any event it's a way to get a few rolls of b&w at local outlets or via internet/mail.  Have some Earl Grey hot, or Lady Grey cold, and give traditional monochrome films a try."},
{"title": "Kodak's New Portra 400 + The Film Photography Project", "date": "Monday, August 08, 2011", "text": "Back in July, the fine folks at the Film Photography Project announced that they were giving away rolls of Kodak's newest film, Portra 400.   I'm always eager to try a new film, and having been delighted with Kodak's Ektar 100, I sent FPP a short email describing my blog and that I would be happy to test it out.  A week or so later, I received a package in the mail..\r\r\rI loaded the film into my Nikon N8008, and went out shooting with it over the next few days.  I shot the film at box speed, with nothing special, no testing at ISO 1600, etc.  Just shooting it like I would most films is my test.  Why try something with it that I normally would not do, anyway?  After I shot the roll, I mailed it to The Darkroom for the free processing that accompanied the roll from FPP.  This evening, I received an email from The Darkroom notifying me that my scans were online and that my order was on the way back with the processed film and CD.  So, I am selecting a few of the shots to share here - none have been post-processed by me - they are exactly as they appeared online at The Darkroom site.  \r\r  Leftovers...\rWhite Lily\rEchinacea at dusk\rOld deer skull in the garden\rCase of the cups\rAmtrak at the crossing\rPhlox\rFaces of Liberty\rMy overall impression?  THIS FILM IS REALLY, REALLY, GOOD.  Granted, I did not do some exhaustive testing, but I did shoot the things I typically do.  I love the colors, the smoothness of the film, and of course, although I did not scan this batch, I will scan the next roll that I purchase.  The scans look very clean and this film is very fine-grained.  Kodak has scored a hit with this film -- shadows are good, sharpness great, and grain negligible.  In fact, I hate to say this -- but it almost is so perfect-looking as to appear digital -- but with a LOT more latitude -- see how the shadows are not blocked out the the street photo at the beginning.  \r\rMy recommendation -- buy this film - buy a lot of it.  Kodak deserves some praise for \"getting it\" when it comes to workflow, as for me -- and with most film shooters today, the scanner is a large part of the routine.  Portra 400 seems to have all of the qualities we have been looking for in a C-41 color film - speed, latitude, color, and \"feel.\"   Kodak is producing this film in a multitude of formats - 35mm, 120, 4x5 (and maybe 8x10?), and I hope it hangs around for a while.\r\rMy thanks to the Film Photography Project for the opportunity to try out the Eastman Kodak Portra 400 and testing The Darkroom's services.  Both are outstanding."},
{"title": "Long-Term Projects", "date": "Sunday, August 07, 2011", "text": "Every now and the I read where someone asks what he or she should do in photography, as if running out of ideas is what's consuming them.  My advice -- start a project -- something long term, and see how your approach and your depth of understanding changes as you become more engaged in a project.  It doesn't have to be unusual, trendy, or arty.  Pick  something that you'd like to know more about, something that you might be afraid to try, a subject that means something to you personally, a topic that might be socially enlightening, or maybe something that has to do with nothing more than a favorite color.  The point is to start something and see where it takes you.  At the heart of art is an inquisitiveness, as art and science sometimes overlap, it's the search for meaning. For years, I have been interested in the backsides of buildings along \"Main Street\" in small towns.  It used to be that people lived above their stores or businesses, and in many places, one worked very close to where one lived.  Today, that's not often the situation. but where downtowns thrive, it seems that people also live in apartments above the businesses.  The backside of a building tells me more about the uses of that building than the storefronts do.  They tend to be more utilitarian, and also show something about the inhabitants as well as the businesses located there.  Documenting these \"backsides\" has been a long-term project and something I try and do when I have the opportunity to visit a town. Like many long-term projects, I don't know where it will end up, but as the saying goes, \"The journey is the reward.\"Try your own long-term project and see where it takes you."},
{"title": "A Review of the Takashi FX521 \"Digital Diana\"", "date": "Sunday, July 31, 2011", "text": "If you are a follower of this blog, you know that most of my reviews are of film cameras, but I certainly do have a few posts on digital cameras.  I just don't go through them the way I do with film cameras.  Here is my review of the Takashi FX 521, available from Ultrafine Online.The Takashi FX521Sometime last year I read about a camera that was described as the equivalent of a \"digital Holga.\"  That camera was the Yashica EZ F521, a 5 MP camera that had minimal control,http://www.blogger.com/img/blank.gif a classic look, and yet had enough pixels to create real prints.  The Yashica EZ was apparently limited to Japan, as I never saw it for sale in the US.  The manufacturer's approach to the camera was appealing, though, and I hoped that a model would become available here in the USA.  Last month I saw that Ultrafine Online was selling the same camera, now branded as a Takashi FX521.  I immediately ordered one - it was on sale for $99.  That's a lot cheaper than many digicams, and I soon received it via UPS.  The camera looks classically styled, alright - it has a real viewfinder as well as a decent-sized rear LCD.  The only controls are a knob on the top deck to choose camera-review-video, and on the rear, with a menu system and navigation buttons.  You focus by turning the lens a fraction of a turn for normal and macro. That's it.  There is a built-in flash, a tripod socket, and a rubber lens cap.  The front definitely reminds me of a Holga.    The menu system allows you to select white balance, EV adjustment, type of image (normal, b&w, sepia, negative, and several colors.  You insert a SD card in the bottom by lifting up the battery latch -- the camera takes three AAA cells which last quite a while.   There is also 32MB of RAM built in, but I suggest a 1 or 2 GB SD card, which will hold a lot of images.  The camera does not retain date information if you change the batteries, so make sure that you enter the date info to avoid having your images all dated Jan. 2008. After using the camera for nearly a month, I have to say that I like it.  Yes, it's probably not as \"holga-like\" as some would demand, but control-wise, it is pretty similar.  It fits easily into a pocket, and because there is no zoom or AF search, it's ready to shoot fairly quickly, and you can use the optical viewfinder if you want to.  It runs a long time on one set of AAA cells, and with a 1 GB card, one can shoot for a long time before using up that space.  The video is pretty decent - certainly good enough for YouTube and Facebook vids.  The macro-mode is okay, and setting up the camera for different in-cam effects is easily done.  The menus are simple and straightforward, and the control layout is thought out pretty well.   By adjusting the EV, I could get more saturated images.  I also like the b&w and sepia modes.  In a way, even though this camera is touted as a digital equivalent of a Holga, it's really a perfect little P&S camera for someone that does not want to have to fiddle around with a multitude of options - sort of like a bridge camera in getting a user from film to digital.  The 5 Mp file size will be enough for 8x10 prints, something lacking in cameras sold as \"toy digital\" that are in the 1 MP range.It's a fun camera. doesn't cost much, and might be the perfect camera to keep in the car or a purse when a photo op arises.   If you desire more holga-type results, editing the images in Picnic or Picasa makes it easy. Sometimes the camera will give unexpected wild effects like this.  I like that. Post work done in Picnic  As the camera says, \"bye-bye!\""},

{"title": "Goodbye, Borders", "date": "Friday, July 22, 2011", "text": "I suppose the Rupert Murdoch scandals and other topics have taken top spot in the news lately, but for those of you that buy books, and especially books on photography, the news that Borders will liquidate and shutter all their stores is a big topic here. Here is in Ann Arbor, where Borders began as a small bookstore, grew larger, became synonymous with great service and wonderful selection, grew larger still with more stores, then had the original owners (Tom and Louis Border) sell the company, and from there began a classic case of over-expansion, mismanagement, and inability to seize opportunity.  Summary - a classic case of rags to riches to rags.  Of course, now, the people \"going to rags\" are the 10,000 employees throughout the chain.  I imagine that the Borders brothers have long dissociated themselves with the thing they created, and are probably sitting back and enjoying their lives, and it's not about them.  It's about the subsequent sale to K-Mart in 2001, having Amazon sell your books because you  didn't figure out that the internet is a BIG thing, and you built way more HUGE stores and forgot to hire top management that understood the book business. Okay, enough of ranting, as it's over, and I will miss the Borders here. Or at least I should say I miss the Borders of about 20 years ago that was on South State.If you look at the \"vintage\" Borders bookmarks above, note that it says over 65,000 titles in stock, art posters, maps and sale books.  It does not say  coffee shop, toys, candy, games, videos, CDs, or stuffed animals.  That was the Borders that many of us loved.  They had a fantastic selection of books on photography (though at the time, I was probably buying computer books more than anything else in the early 1990s).  The Borders then moved to Liberty Street (their \"Flagship Store\") and had a very good photography book selection until the past few years, and in the past 6 months, it was dismal.  The closing of a big chain will have repercussion in the publishing world, for sure.  The advantage of a real store is that I love to browse books, and look at them before deciding what I am going to buy.  You can't really do that with Amazon.  Photography books - especially those that are not about \"how to use your DSLR\" usually have lower sales than any trade paperbacks, and are certainly more expensive to produce than a text-only novel.  The browsing experience is important with them.   Maybe it's better to be content with being relatively small and very good, but in the business world, it seems that nobody's happy with that.Hopefully, another large bookstore will find its way into downtown Ann Arbor.  But the sad reality is Borders is gone - forever.  I won't be at the liquidation sale that starts today. Maybe not ever.  Let me know your favorite memories of Borders."},
{"title": "The Ansco No.2 Folding Buster Brown", "date": "Sunday, July 17, 2011", "text": "I have only put one roll of film through this camera so far, and having bought it a few years ago for $10, it's about time that I showcased it here.  Produced by Ansco in Binghamton, N.Y. the camera differs from the typical \"Buster Browns\" in that the front drops down and the bellows travels along a rail and the lensboard locks into a fixed position.  The typical Buster Brown cameras are box-camera style.  The tiny reflex viewfinder is missing, but they are hard to use, anyway.  I just mount this on a tripod and estimate the field of view and fire away.  The shutter actually is in front of the lens, so if you have never seen one, don't think that the lens is missing.  The camera dates from between 1918 and 1925 or so.  The camera takes 120 film, making it quite useable.  Shutter speeds are T,B, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100th sec.  Apertures are from f8 to f64!  No doubt that a tripod is required for anything below f/16 @ 1/100 sec, using ISO 100 film.   It's a fixed focus camera, meaning that it focuses from about 10 feet to infinity.  I am including one shot I took back in May,along the flooded area of Fleming Creek by Parker Mill.  I think it was probably at f/64 for 10 to 15 seconds."},
{"title": "A little love for the Pentax ZX-5", "date": "Sunday, July 03, 2011", "text": "Before I left for Photostock last week, I picked up a used Pentax ZX-5 at Huron Camera for a bargain price.  I decided to bring it along at the last minute and shoot with it (which obviously violates the common-sense of never bring an untested or new camera on a trip).  The ZX-5, unlike some of the later models of AF K-mount cameras, has a real dial on the top for Aperture priority and shutter speed selection, not some twiddly LCD screen.  I didn't have an AF lens for it, but it worked fine with manual lenses and center-weighted metering. It's lightweight, has a dial for exposure compensation, and is a nice alternative, in my opinion, to the metal-bodies of the Pentax ME, ME Super, etc.  With the 40mm pancake lens on the front, it becomes a wonderful street camera with a quiet shutter and auto film advance. I carried the ZX-5 along during my trip and throughout Photostock (more about that in another post) and shot color film with it.  The ZX-5 also has a \"Panoramic\" setting that masks the 35mm frame to a pseudo panorama.  While not really panoramic in size, it nevertheless creates an opportunity for creative framing.  Overall, the ZX-5 is a good addition to my stable of cameras.  It offers the simplicity that one expects in a film camera, but yet offers some nice advancements over the earlier Pentax models - auto film advance, pop-up flash, matrix, center-weighted, and spot metering, auto ISO or user selectable settings, panorama mask, +/- expsoure compensation in 1/2 stop increments, AF if you use an AF lens, and the ability to use all manual K-mount lenses.

Bill Schwab hosts the event in Harbor Springs, and it's a very laid-back time.  It's great to reconnect with other photographers with similar interests, and spend time talking about photography, doing lots of shooting, and basically recharging the creative batteries.  Usually I team up with my buddy Marc Akemann, and we go find photos where we can.  It's a lot of driving, of course, but we have a great time, and some of my most memorable photographs have been made during the long Photostock weekend.I try to bring a different camera system or format for each time I have participated.  This year, I am leaving the DSLR and lenses home, and am shooting mostly medium format.  I'll have my Mamiya 645E system, a Great wall 6x6 SLR, a Halina AI TLR (crappiness abounds!) and an Argus Argoflex 40 to shoot some expired Verichrome Pan film.   I'll also have my Penatx ME with the 40mm pancake lens and the pocketable Chinon Bellami (see previous post) for the 35mm end.  An Olympus C5050 will be with me for snapshots of events.  I'm also bringing a backdrop, lightstands and umbrellas in case I decide to shoot portraits with the Great Wall.Hopefully, we won't have rain, but whatever happens, I know it will be good to get away!See you next week."},
{"title": "The Little Chinon Bellami", "date": "Saturday, June 18, 2011", "text": "The Chinon Bellami, a little 35mm camera with zone focus and \"barn doors\" covering the lens, is a very desirable pocket camera.  Introduced in 1981, the Bellami shows some similarities with the much-loved Olympus XA series.  Approximately the same size as the XA, the Bellami has a retractable lens that is covered by two doors that flip open when you advance the film, which also turns the camera on.  The exposure meter can be set for ISO ratings from 25  to 400.  The cameras also features a threaded cable release socket, shutter speeds from 1/8 to 1/1000 sec., 35mm f/2.8 lens, daylight (fill flash) sync, and battery check.  The detachable flash is very similar to that found on the Olympus XA series, and definitely makes for a less-compact camera when attached.  I picked up my example on ebay for a modest price.  I was amazed that the camera was still in its original box with all the papers and manuals.  I was prepared to be disappointed by this camera, as sometimes the hype on some classics (a modern classic, if you want to call it that)exceeds the results obtained.  It IS a small camera, shown here next to an old roll of Kodachrome (which is used only for illustrative purposes).  The Bellami is a stylish design, much nicer than the clunky Rollei 35, though a tad longer.  Not too different in size from an Olympus XA, though.  With the doors covering the lens, it slides easily in and out of a pocket, and is comfortable to grip.  I can set the distance marking to the 10m ft marking, and it's basically a point and shoot.   Compare the Bellami with the hulking Pentax 6x7:Of course, with any camera, the proof is in the images.  I found that my camera had some trouble in the beginning with longer exposures, but after working with it a while, it appears to have just been in need of some use.   Here are a few shots on color film: A detail from the Diego Rivera mural at the Detroit Institute of Art.The wall of the Dexter bakery.I later put in a roll of long-expired Delta 400 b&w film, and I think the results are not too bad.stairs at the UM Museum of Art.  The negative was greatly overexposed, but post-processing cleaned it up pretty well.Along South Univ., note the bromide drag from developing.  Using the flash -- I think I'll stick to natural light.  Like any small camera with the flash so close to the plane of the lens, lighting will be kinda harsh. On campus, once again. Not too much distortion in the verticals here.I'll put more film in the camera this week and do some more shooting with it.  Now that I know it's a fairly decent performer, it will travel with me for a while and I'll see how it does when the weather is summery, rather than wintery.  So many cameras..."},
{"title": "An Explosion of Flora", "date": "Friday, June 03, 2011", "text": "If you like photographing flowers and gardens, late May and early June is truly a time to not stand still.  There are daily changes in what's blooming, and it comes and goes very quickly.  I am very fortunate that my wife Adrienne is a horticulturist -- the fact that we have wonderful gardens with beautiful perennials is all due to her talent and hard work.  Me, I dig holes and plant things where she wants them.  I'm not clueless about plants or flowers -- I had a botany minor in college, and as an entomologist, it helps that I know something about plant life.  However, I am a better photographer than I am a gardener.  The gardens at our house provide me with a never-ending source of photographic subjects, and I am sure that I have shot thousands of images right here.  The point I want to make here is that the way to hone your skill and develop a style, is to shoot often.  If you are interested in flower and garden photography, architectural photography, nature photography, fashion, trains, or any other genre -- you need to shoot often to better your skill and competence, as well as find a style that gets your creative side going.  Not everyone can shoot some subjects every day, but flowers and gardens are good training and preparation for other types of nature and landscape photography.  Shoot at different times of the day -- even twilight, to see how lighting changes the atmosphere  of an image.  Wet flowers and grounds after a rain give the garden a totally luscious look that is absent when everything is dry and less intense-looking.  Try different focal length lenses and see how they affect your scene.  This is a good time to become familiar with your tripod as well.  I recently set up my old plain-prism Nikon F with the standard 50mm f:2 lens, a roll of Walgreens 200 (made by Fuji) color film, my sturdiest tripod, and a cable release.  I wanted to shoot in the garden late in the day at f/16 and see what results I might get.As you can see, that photo is pretty darn sharp, well-detailed, and great color.  Sometimes I want a softer, dreamier look.softer and dreamier, dammmit! But not this dreamy...I'm thankful to have such a lovely photographic playground!"},
{"title": "The Sima Soft Focus Lens", "date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2011", "text": "Your basic plastic tube with a single lens, the Sima Soft Focus 100mm lens is a 1980s-vintage accessory that predates the Holga and the Lensbaby line.  Nominally a maximum aperture of f:2, the lens has inserts with smaller diameter openings (much like the original Lensbaby) that allow for greater depth of field and less aberration.  An additional bonus is that the lens also can be used as a macro, providing a different effect for those wanting to get close-up to the subjects.  The Sima lens is a T-mount, meaning you use the proper screw-on adapter to fit you camera lens mount.  Years ago I saw these lenses for sale and didn't bother buying one because they seemed so cheap.  However, preferences and approaches change, and when I saw one in Huron Camera in the bargain bin for $10, I snapped it up.  It didn't have the aperture disks or the T-mount adapter, but I already had the adapters, and it's easy to cut out a black paper circle with an aperture.  Today, it's most likely that any users of the Sima lens will place it on a digital body.  However, the problem with that is that on an APS-sized sensor, the effective focal length is 150mm, perhaps too narrow a field of view for portraits, etc., but really nice for macro.  The other problem with using the lens on a DSLR, is that there will be fringing on any light-colored reflective subjects -- it does occur on film, too, but the effect is magnified by on a sensor.I like using this lens with a camera like the Nikon FM, as it's a lightweight combination, and of course, there are no external lens adjustments, save for the focusing of the tube within a tube.  The single element plastic lens is certainly capable of producing some very dreamy effects.  I found that using it with a grainier 400 speed film, the effect is quite \"pictorial\"...In macro mode, the lens is a lot of fun, too: This one was taken with a Nikon D70s.So, is the Sima Soft Focus lens something you should buy?  If you like the effect in the images I posted here, you'll have a blast with the lens.  I think it would be fun with portraits and nudes in black and white, too.  You'll need to keep an eye out for it on ebay, or at a camera show. Expect to pay more than $10, though!"},
{"title": "The Bell & Howell Electric Eye 127", "date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2011", "text": "This is actually a very easy-to-use 127 camera that appeared about 1958-59.  With its electric eye and automatic aperture control and large viewfinder, it made picture -taking relatively easy.  Of course, the big problem is that 127 film is now fairly hard to come by, and that's really too bad, as there were some fun cameras and some very well-made cameras that used 127.  I have sold off most of my 127 cameras, and I have this one up on ebay, just to clear out some space and rid myself of cameras that I am no longer using.  The B&H EE 127 was actually a very well-made camera, and the Selenium cell has lasted far longer than cameras of more recent vintage.  Just to show you that the camera can take some nice square images, here are a few from about 6 - 8 years ago that I shot on b&w film.Bethel Church (2005) on Bethel Church and Schneider Roads.At the Produce Station in Ann Arbor, 2004:I think square format in 127 size really makes the best use of that format, and back when one could buy Ektachrome in 127, it was used to shoot \"super slides\" - that could be used in a 35mm projector.   The 4x4 Rolleiflex, Sawyer's and Yashica TLR cameras are, in my opinion, the best cameras made for 127 film."},

{"title": "A Tasty Pancake", "date": "Saturday, May 07, 2011", "text": "...Lens, that is.  The original Pentax SMC 40mm f2.8 lens is a classic lens with a well-deserved reputation.  It's angle of view is not quite as wide as a 35mm lens, but wider than a 50mm normal lens.  It's very compact - about 3/4\" long in front of the body, making it a very compact package when paired with a camera like the Pentax ME.  I have tried other \"pancake\" lenses, such as the Minolta 45mm 2.0 MD and the Konica 40mm 1.8.  I've not tried the Nikon 45mm 2.8 GN nor the 45mm P lens -- the original is a rarity, and the newer AIS version is out of reach. Both lenses command a premium price these days.   I liked the Konica 40mm 1.8 -- it's the fastest of the pancake lenses, but I didn't really care for the Konica Autoreflex TC camera, as I am not a fan of shutter priority.  I sold off all my Minolta gear a while ago, but I am sure I have negatives and slides shot with the 45mm Minolta lens, but none are scanned to show here.The Pentax 40mm lens is highly desirable, as it's very compact, and the DSLR folks have been driving the prices up.  I was able to find a nice example online  at KEH for a bit over $100.  I really like it on my Pentax ME -- it makes for a lightweight and very compact unit to carry around, and is perfect for street shooting.  I've used it in a variety of situations, and mostly with ISO 100 film.  A film like Tri-X or Ilford HP-5+ should be perfect for all-around street shooting with B&W film."},

I admit that when I bought my Fuji Finepix S7000 in 2004, that the choice was between the C5050 and the S7000. I think I chose the Fuji because of its feature set and zoom range, and used it with great success for a year or so, until I upgraded to A Nikon D70s.   I always liked the styling of the C5050, as it looks more like a film camera, and it has an optical viewfinder.  With all the advanced features of today's P&S digicams, one might ask why anyone would buy a long-discontinued camera such as the Olympus C5050Z.  Well, there are a few reasons to like a camera such as the C5050:used price -- variable, but $100 or less for what was once the top camera in its class.optics -- excellent, with a max aperture of f/1.8 at the shortest focal length (which is about equal to 35mm)optical viewfinderimage size - 5 MP is still plenty big enough for 8x12 prints, and I can choose a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of 4:3, providing me with a 35mm equivalent framing.external flash shoe -- allows one to use studio strobes and other flashes, if desired.I also have plenty of 512MB and 1 GB CF cards that can hold a lot of images in a camera like the C5050. Since I bought the camera from KEH back at the end of March, it's become the one I carry in my backpack.  It has a rugged magnesium body, and the controls are easy to navigate, once I familiarized myself with them.  It seems to run a long, long time on 4 NiMH rechargeable batteries -- longer, in fact, than my Canon G11 with its LiOn battery.  I also have the remote IR shutter release for it, which is really a handy thing to have when its needed.Yes, compared to current models, the LCD screen on the back is tiny -- but then, it probably uses a lot less power.  It does adjust and you can use the camera like a TLR if you want -- try it!  With a decent optical VF, I can be pretty sure that what I see is about what I will get -- just like with a RF film camera.Some sample shots:I really like the \"whiteboard\" mode for making high-contrast B&W images in camera.

{"title": "Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day 2011", "date": "Sunday, April 17, 2011", "text": "From WPPD 2009.This April 24th is WPPD, and I know that I will be out and about doing some pinholery.  Pinhole cameras are the most rudimentary cameras imaginable.  To make one, it doesn't take much more than a light-tight box with a tiny pinhole at one end, and a piece of film or photographic paper at the other.  Compared to some of my Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club photographers, I am just an occasional pinholer.  Some of those people are really accomplished users of pinhole cameras, and several of them have made some outstanding pinhole cameras that are far more than the stereotypical oatmeal box.John Baird of Dexter, MI has a wonderful panoramic pinhole camera that uses 120 film and it's a work of art,  as are his photographs.  Ross Orr, of Ann Arbor, has a camera design that was featured in an issue of MAKE Magazine, and that camera also uses 120 film, and is one that I will build someday. Bill Bresler of Plymouth, MI has some awesome pinhole images that are best seen as large prints.  Matt Callow, also in Ann Arbor, has been making simple pinhole cameras and making wonderful images from them.  These are just a few local photographers that I know, and if you look on Flickr or APUG, you will undoubtedly find many more.   Why have pinhole techniques remained popular in this age of technology?  One of the most endearing traits is that of simplicity.  Please don't tell me that you have an iPad app that mimics the effect of a pinhole.  You are totally missing the damn point.  That's about like telling me that you have an internet girlfriend that you chat with online.  Or, that you can play air guitar.  These are not REAL things, they are facsimiles, and just because you have a paint program does not mean that you know anything about mixing a palette of acrylics and applying them to canvas.  Get my point?  Pinhole cameras are hands-on fun that can lead a person into creating some very poignant and impressive imagery.  Because they don't require much in the way of technology, they can be really creative tools in the hands of the right person.    Another feature of pinhole photography is that because exposures can often take more than a few seconds, the quality of time is altered.  You are no longer getting an image in a fraction of a second, but anywhere from 1 second to many minutes.  The time is stretched, and anything moving within the frame can be blurred.  A creative photographer can use that to great effect.The third great thing about pinhole photography is that of the optical nature of the pinhole itself.  Depending on the focal length and film size, you can generate extreme wide-angle aspects of a scene, or you can go for a more natural aspect ratio.   Because of the simplistic nature of pinhole cameras, you can experiment with all kinds of containers to see what works for your vision.  It could be a 35mm film can or an old Dodge van converted into a roving pinhole camera.SourcesWhile yes, you can buy a pinhole camera - either in kit form or pre-assembled, you can easily make one yourself.  There are also downloadable templates for creating a pinhole camera that looks like a 35mm, or a Hasselblad.You can consult the Pinhole Resource for pinhole sizes, templates, and tips on making pinholes.  The Luminous Landscape and Pinhole Resource sites have more information on making your own pinhole camera.  As far as kits, here are a few:1. STD 35 paper-bodied 35mm kit2. Perhaps the best value overall- a plastic-bodied 35mm kit for less than $10!3. How about a STEREO pinhole camera kit?4. Then, there is the paint-can pinhole camera...Books -- perhaps the best book out there is \"Adventures with Pinhole and Home-made Cameras, by John Evans, and published by Rotovision Books in 2003.  It's still in print.  I'll probably be using my Holga Ultra-wide pinhole camera.  It's one of the best values out there for a wide-angle camera that takes 120 film, and the results are good.  But the beauty of pinhole cameras is that they can cost virtually nothing, and produce priceless images.Have fun on WPPD!"},

I don't know the history of the camera, and where Jeff shot with it, but it had sentimental appeal to me, and it's an all-black FM (with brassing in all the right places and no dents) and I have always wanted one that worked properly.  I put in new S-76 cells and the camera seems to work just fine.  One of my projects this year, to pay my respect to Jeff, is to use the camera for street photography, and use a different lens each month.  The lens I tested it with is the standard 50mm 2.0 AIS lens.  I mostly like Aperture-priority for street shots, so using the LED-matching manual exposure of the FM is less convenient, but certainly not a problem.Some images from the first roll:  The above images were all shot on Kodak Gold 100 C-41 film - my favorite color emulsion.

With 30 pieces, this exhibit shows some of my photographs taken roaming the roads of Michigan, and is titled \"Michigan Roadside Adventures.  I finished up all the labels and packed up the work today, and I am ready to hang it all tomorrow afternoon, with help from a couple  of friends.  Selecting images for this show was a challenge, and I did not want repetition. I have no lack of photographs from all over Michigan, and could easily have a show on: barns, grain elevators, theaters, signs, etc.  The photographs were mostly shot digitally, though there are a few that were the result of film scans.  All except the Polaroids were printed by mpix, and I highly recommend them.

Many of the photos were shot in 2006, when I was driving all over with Marjorie for her project on Michigan theaters.  The Tawas Gull shot above, remains one of my favorites.  Right now, I am ready for a nap, but I will post some images of the set-up tomorrow."},
{"title": "Remembering Jeff Lamb", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2011", "text": "Jeff in 2009.Jeff Lamb, fellow photographer, citizen of Ann Arbor, and friend to many, slipped away from the living on Tuesday, due to cancer.  It's hard to believe that he'd gone so quickly.   I visited Jeff in hospice last Friday, and there were moments when I could sense a tiny bit of the old Jeff, but his condition really shocked me. I think he had been diagnosed with liver cancer only three weeks before. The previous time I saw him was in early January when we had a beer together, and afterward I saw him on the street photographing like he did so often, with his digital Leica.  That was Jeff, with his floppy hat and camera, finding something interesting in everything.Jeff always had a story to tell, and to sit down with him and talk about photography, architecture, the history of Ann arbor, and politics over a beer or two was not a bad way to spend a few hours.  There was a gentleness and twinkle to Jeff's eyes that said \"I'm enjoying life.\"  In January, Jeff told me was getting into doing some new projects, and was quite enthused about photographing some parts of Detroit.  Somewhat like his comprehensive survey of New Orleans neighborhoods, Detroit offered a new challenge. The decaying neighborhoods and possibilities of showing people at their best when a city is at its worst was obviously intriguing.  I can't say that Jeff and I were lifelong friends, but he had a way of making me feel like we had always been so.  I suspect he had that effect on a lot of people, as many, many friends have expressed their sorrow and love of Jeff over the past few days.  Jeff was a kind, interesting, and genuine person, and his wife Leyla and their dog Sonny Boy are probably missing him terribly.  Who would know that when he celebrated his birthday on January 16, that it would be his last?I am sure that when Jeff's friends gather sometime to celebrate him and his life, there will be some great stories. Probably a few will point out that while Jeff's life ended too soon, he had a colorful, interesting and purposeful life.  Which, in all fairness, is the best anyone can hope for.  Have a passion about something and do it, with no regrets later.  So long as we remember those things about Jeff that made us smile, a bit of him is always with us.

Arriving a bit after 11 Chicago time, we did some sightseeing/photography on the way to the exhibit. The Union Station in Chicago is a very photogenic building, both exterior, and interior.   I love the way the shadows from the columns hit the pilasters.We arrived at the CCC around 12:20, and met up with one of my Flickr contacts, Trish, and two former Ann Arborites, Pedro and Angela.  The Vivian Maier exhibit is astounding.  Her photography is empathic, for want of a better word. In looking at the breadth of her work, one can easily see traces of Diane Arbus, Gary Winogrand, Henri C-B, etc.  However, her images are truly her own.  The image selection was wonderful, and I left the exhibit wanting more.  I am sure that we will see more of her photography in the near future.   A sneaked shot of a part of the exhibit.  Those are three of Vivian Maier's  cameras in the display case.  There was also a big show of many prints from a Diana camera -- all were printed small - contact size, and while I liked the show, there were a few too many.  After that, we went upstairs to see the Louis Sullivan architecture exhibit.  The Chicago Cultural Center is a beauty of a building inside, and an orchestra was playing while we were there, adding a bit extra to our experience.  Oh, and they have an Art-O-Mat there, which is very cool. The giftshop was closed, so I could not buy a token to use it.We then made our way to Miller's Pub for a tasty lunch -- they have an extensive beer list - I had a Smuttynose Porter, which was quite tasty. We then bid goodbye to our Chicago friends and walked back to Union Station to wait for our bus.  We had a relaxing ride back, arriving in Ann Arbor around 10 pm.  A whirlwind of a trip, but it's always nice wanting more...  The group, with the exception of me...somebody has to be the photographer!I used the Pentax ME and the Rolleiflex for most of my shots.  I love the ME for street shooting, since it's aperture-priority, lightweight, compact, and fairly quiet for an SLR."},

(On top of that, Daylight Savings Time starts tomorrow).  It's about a 10 block walk to Millenium Park from the station, with lots of photo ops along the way.

I will probably finish my Powerpoint slides today, but most of my effort really goes into deciding how in-depth to cover a subject in a few hours. Any aspect of photography, any subject one can think, undoubtedly has several approaches, and many techniques and tools to consider. In my class, it will be about shooting all three phases and combinations thereof, and the different approaches and aesthetics that each phase may present. I have always enjoyed photographing water -- some of my earliest shots in the 1970s were of the river and streams behind the house where I grew up, in northern NY.  The landscape there is a lot more rugged than the flatness of southern Michigan, but even here, one can savor the sounds of a babbling brook with a little searching around.Mallet's Creek in Ann ArborWater photography is always a challenge in trying to get the best exposure.  My long exposures of moving water are a never-ending search for perfection.  Sometimes I do it pretty well.Bond Falls, Paulding, MIIt's always fun getting a class like this together.  I enjoy teaching things I am passionate about, and watching students grasp a new concept or be amazed at what a simple filter can do is fun for me.

It's obvious that Kodak is simplifying its line of films, and given the market niche, it probably makes sense.  This is not 1990, when the Kodak film offerings were amazingly varied.

It was a Minolta X-700 that had been given to him about 15 years before by my now-deceased mentor, Bill -- who was also the previous owner of my house.  I went over and chatted with my neighbors for a while, and we talked about photography, and also about Bill's generosity of time and equipment.  The X-700 looks like new, and in fact, it had been serviced by Dave's Camera Repair in 1999, so there is no bad capacitor and the camera works like a new one.  I was very happy to give the camera a new home, but in fact, it was it's old home!  I often wonder how many cameras Bill bought at Ann Arbor camera stores -- especially the old Big George's.  This is my second X-700 that came from Bill.  He gave me an X-700 with just about every macro attachment in 2001, and I used that gear frequently, and added more lenses, as well as a nice XE-7.  The X-700 went to NYC with me in 2004, and was a great camera on that trip. I ended up selling off all my Minolta gear about a year ago, as I wasn't using it all that often. Hey, I already have as much Nikon gear as I need, as well as some Olympus, Pentax, and Canon outfits.  But seeing that pretty X-700 made me realize that I was fond of that camera.  This one's staying home... Libellula luctuosa, shot in 2004 with my previous X-700.Minolta made some great cameras.  From those all-metal workhorse SRT-series bodies, to the very well-made XE-7 (which has the guts of a Leica R3 SLR), to the last of the manual bodies, the X-700.  The only knock on the X-700 bodies was the problematic capacitor issue which renders the camera useless if it goes bad.  The lenses are excellent, and it is a full-featured system that will provide just about anything you would ask from a manual 35mm SLR.  When Minolta came out with the Maxxum AF system and introduced a new lens-mount, there was no backwards compatibility (as with the Canon EOS and manual FD-mount cameras).  Consequently, you can now buy used manual Minolta bodies and lenses at very good prices. One last photo from 2005, taken with the previous X-700:"},
{"title": "Upcoming Show - Phase Change", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2011", "text": "A few posts ago, I described getting materials ready for matting and framing for an exhibit.  Now, I can tell you a bit more about it.  The exhibit, \"Phase Change - Water In Winter\" will be at Matthaei Botanical Gardens from February 18 to March 27. MBG is located at 1800 North Dixboro Rd., Ann Arbor.  Getting the images together - some of which started as digital, some as film, is perhaps the most challenging part.  In fact, although making the images required some planning, some of my most memorable shots were due to pure luck.  Some of my best shots were taken on a whim in March 2009 when I stopped at Dexter-Huron Metropark and saw some wonderful ice shapes and patterns that I have not seen since.  Nature is like that, and it shows that one really has to be ready to shoot when an opportunity presents itself. On top of it ll, winter weather is often unpredictable.  Waiting a few more days to go shooting might put me right in the middle of a thaw.  So, shoot while the ice is cold, I say.  Winter photography is hard work, though. I like shooting on gray days when the contrast isn't so great, and I don't have to worry about glare and specular highlghts. Most of my shots are taken on TechPan film when I am using film.  The tonality and slowness of the film allows me to take longer exposures over water without the use of filters.  In some case, the juxtaposition of the hard ice surface and the flowing water provided me with an opportunity to make some surreal images. I am slowly building up a large number of images of water in winter that may end up as a book at some time.  For now, this first show is just a sample of what I have been doing just in and around Ann Arbor, proving once again, that you can do some good work right where you live, in the place that you know the best.What I found in making these photos, was that the conditions forced me to slow down and think about what I was seeing.  There are abstractions, patterns, and miniature landscapes in these water shots.  Often, instead of using the wide view, I used a zoom telephoto to capture a small part of  scene, that isolated, gives a different impression than a full-scene view might have.  In some images, the scale is evident, in others it is not."},
{"title": "The mighty little Sears 35RF", "date": "Friday, January 28, 2011", "text": "I don't shoot all that much slide film these days.  A decade ago, I was easily shooting 30-50 rolls a year.  Now, it's down to less than 10, including the cross-processed stuff.  It's pretty simple really, C-41 and b&w are cheaper, and most of my color photography is done digitally.  However, the true test of a camera has always been how it handles (and how the photographer handles, for that matter) slide film -- as in how accurate is the exposure system?  Slide film has a dynamic range not too different from digital sensors, and depending on the film, the latitude can be only a stop or less in the difference between a good and bad exposure. So, I was a little curious as to what I would get from the little Sears 35RF camera that i have had for a while. These small cameras have a sensor on the front of the lens assembly, so one can use filters and get a proper exposure.   I have shot mostly b&w with it, and maybe a roll of color C-41.  I put in a roll of Ektachrome 100(probably expired, at that)back in the summer and made a bunch of random shots at different places.   Overall, I am pleased with the results, and a few examples are shown below. By the way, this camera was probably made by Chinon for Sears.  It's very similar to the Konica C-35.    Echinaceas are among my favorite flowers.  I have taken many a test shot in my front yard.One of the boardwalks at Crosswinds Marsh in Wayne County.

{"title": "Three Films on the Huron", "date": "Wednesday, January 26, 2011", "text": "On January 16, I decided to do a little shooting with a couple of odd films that were in my fridge.  I have been gradually accumulating a body of work that features winter shots on the Huron River, and I figured that some high-contrast films might lend some different results.  Of the three cassettes shown here, the only one that I have any experience with is the TechPan -- an ISO 25 film that when developed in Technidol developer,produces lovely images with full tonality and imperceptible grain.  If you develop TechPan in Dektol, you get high-contrast images with no  middle tones.  So, while it is a very versatile film (alas, no longer manufactured), it is most highly prized for its \"grainless\" negatives.This is an example of TechPan used where it does the most good - a long exposure that does not require the use of ND filters.Fleming Creek on 1/15/2011. Canon A-1, TechPan, 70-210 Vivitar Series 1 lens.You can see that TechPan renders beautiful tones when developed in Technidol.The other two films, Kodak Rapid Process Copy Film and Ektagraphic HC Slide Film are totally diferent from each other and from TechPan.  Rapid Process Copy Film (RPC) was most likely used for making 35mm copy negatives.  It's an extremely slow (ISO is  maybe 3 in sunlight) film that one should probably not think of using for pictorial work.  The other characteristic is that based on its recommended use, it creates a positive image (which I did not realize until after I removed the processed film from the reel!).  The recommended developer is DK-50 (which I have a bunch of) at full strength for 10 minutes.  I bracketed my exposures at 1 sec, 4 sec, 6 sec, and 8 sec at f/16 using my Nikon FM2N and 35-105 Nikkor lens.  Here are a couple of resulting images: Frozen Huron 1 Frozen Huron 2As a copy film, one would expect the RPC to have full tonality, and it does.  If you happen to find a roll somewhere, I would start bracketing at 8 sec and go from there.  I think be able to have a direct positive is very cool, but of course, this is not a film to be used where objects are moving.  The last film, the Ektagraphic HC Slide Film appears to be nothing more than a variant of Kodalith film, as it was supposed to be used for making high-contrast b&w slides of text (all before Powerpoint obsoleted such uses).  The roll I have came from George O'Neal and he has already used part of the roll.  I had no idea how much was left -- it turns out I had 6 exposures left, and that was it.  I processed the film in Technidol along with a roll of TechPan, and figured with that few exposures, I might learn something.  It turns out that the Technidol developer did a pretty good job, though the mid-tones seem somewhat blocked up, and whether that is a film or developer-based result, I do not know.  I will experiment with normal Kodalith and Technidol and see what happens.Herewith is the example:  It's a challenge trying films for atypical uses.  You have to decide beforehand, how you are going to shoot the film and that also determines, in the case of high-contrast films -- what developers you can use afterwords.   I am very lucky to have access to a lot of photographic literature, and that has been very helpful when trying to figure out what to do with some of these arcane emulsions.  Now I need to find some more Rapid Process Copy Film! I have LOTS of DK-50..."},
{"title": "Framing Your Work - Part II", "date": "Sunday, January 23, 2011", "text": "From the 2010 show at the Recycle-Reuse Gallery.  Note all the different frames.As I have been getting ready for an exhibition, I had to choose what type of frame I was going to use.  Most of my past shows have been with 11x14 inch frames.  That's a decent size for 7x7 and 8x10 sized images, but going larger demands bigger mats and frames.  If you have a stock of 11x14 metal frames, they will last for a long time and multiple shows (especially if you do not end selling much of your work). There is no law that says all of your framed work should look consistent, but it sure as hell looks a lot nicer for a show.  That's why I stated in the last post to stick to a single color, if possible, or at least use frames that can be easily repainted if necessary.  This time around I have had to look for 16x20 and 20x20 frames.  In the past, I have purchased frame kits from American Frame in Maumee, OH, or from Dick Blick online.   With a large number of pieces, I looked for something that was durable, inexpensive, and included glass.  I have been buying smaller frames from Ikea for years.  Their 5x7, 8x10, and 9x9 \"Ribba\" frames are made of solid wood, and the birch color is very attractive.  However, as you go to larger sizes, the frames are made of fiberboard with vinyl overlays.  I don't recommend fiberboard frames for temporary shows for a couple of reasons.  First of all, they are not very durable with the vinyl covering.  You can't easily repaint them, and second of all, inserting a matted photograph has to be done very carefully and rechecked to make sure that little pieces of dust from the fiberboard did not fall off in front of the mat.  Believe me, that is a pain in the ass to have to remove the mated photo, clean everything off again, blow away any residual debris, etc. and replace everything the way it was.  Third, it is no secret that while in the US, we use 16 x 20, 11x 14, etc., Ikea is a global company, and their frames are in the metric sizes.  Therefore, their 40x50cm Ribba frame is actually 15 3/4 x 19 3/4 inches.  It's not a big deal to have to cut my mats slightly smaller, but it does make for a bit more complexity.  Yes, they come with a nice PH-neutral overmat, but my mats will need a 10 x 15 inch opening,not exactly standard.As I shopped at Ikea, I abandoned my idea to use the more-substantial-looking black Ribba frames at $14.99 (which IS cheap, believe me), and took a look at their Strömby frames.  The \"16x20\" Strömby frames are metal, painted gray, and also only $9.99 each.  I bought one of each of the sizes I need to try them out.  Remember, they have to be able to be hung in a gallery, be durable, and easy to insert and remove the artwork.  After trying them out, I went out and bought the remainder that I needed.  I spent $120 on 12 frames, which is pretty darn cheap.   The backs are secured with plastic cams that have holes for the hanging wire, and they appear to work quite well. I usually end up not using the Masonite panel that is included, but use my mats instead.  Of course, it helps if you have an Ikea nearby.  I only have to drive less than 20 miles, and I don't think they ship the frames via mail-order.  I'll take photos of the show once it is hung, but for now I will leave you with some sources:American Frame - Comprehensive selection, high quality, and fast shipping.Dick Blick - their cheapest metal frames are pretty good, but they use styrene instead of glass, which I don't like.PictureFrames.com -- their cheapest 16x20 sectional metal frames are less than $13.00 each, and do not include glass or mats.  However, they offer  mat boards and other framing supplies and appear to be a great deal for anyone wanting to purchase their frames in quantity.  Their 777FSL Economy Metal Frame is \"Frosted Silver\" and a 12x12 frames is $9.22. That's pretty good, IMHO.  ClearBags.com - inexpensive pre-cut mats and back mats and Mylar bags for your artwork. Highly recommended."},
{"title": "Framing Your Work", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2011", "text": "I have at least two shows coming up in the next few months, and each will require me to use larger frames than I have in the past. So, I am shopping around for 16x20 inch frames. I am a stickler about matting and framing, which I do myself.  Over the course of hanging a number of exhibits, including my own work, I have a checklist of do's and dont's for photographers that exhibit their work.  Of course, if all you ever do is upload your images to the web to share with your friends, ala Flickr, this probably won't apply to you.  However, if there is one thing you should know, it is that a matted and framed photo on a wall is very different from an image seen on a computer screen.  Part of the reason is that a matted photograph stands out from the area around it -- it at once isolates the image and focuses your eyes on the content.  There is a very annoying trendy thing going on with photos on canvas.  It is trendy, because like many trendy thing, in 10 years they will out of vogue and in the trash bin.  A photograph is not an oil painting, or a watercolor, or a sculpture. The mat around the photograph, and a frame, take the image to its own little island, where you can gaze at it and judge its merits.  Don't fall for the thumbtacks on the wall approach to show your work, either.  That's just a shitty way to present yourself.  It says to me that you place so little value in your work that you can't be bothered with making an effort to do the presentation right.Of course, I recognize that apart from the money you may have spent on your equipment, showing your work involves more dollars.  So, there you have a choice... cheap or expensive?  There is not too much mystery in what is involved in matting and framing photographs.  There are numerous tutorials online and in books that spell out the various methods used to show photographs.    Some of the techniques, like anything, require practice to get good enough at it (such as mat cutting), and having the proper tools and space to do it right really helps (no surprise here).  So, it comes down to mats and frames and glass where the expense comes in.  When I first started out, I bought my frames at a local chain of craft stores because I needed one or two at a time. Later, when I needed to have  nearly 2 dozen pieces ready for a show, I realized that I needed to shop online for the best prices, buying frame sections in bulk.  So, here are a few tips and some guidelines:1. Be thrifty. It helps to shop thrift stores and the like for used frames.  Even if the frame isn't in the best of shape, maybe the glass is worth a few bucks, and can be used later on.  You can always repaint frames, too.2. Size. Stick to a few sizes for your work to keep the matting and framing consistent.  8x10 inches -- I consider that the smallest size to exhibit outside the home. 11x14 is more versatile, and allows you to show 7x7 to 8x11 images with at least 1.5 inches of overmat.  16x20 seems big until you start printing bigger than 11x14.  Square frames are less common, but 9x9 is great for 5x5 square images, especially Polaroids.  12x12 and 18x18 are good, too.    However, you may decide that another size range suits your style better.  Oddball sizes are great when you want to give gifts or experiment with different formats and aspect ratios with your prints.3. Colors.  Black is my favorite frame color, second is silver, third is natural wood.  You can mix metal and wood frames in a show if they are all black, but not if they are silver or wood.  4. Materials.  Avoid plastic frames that look like the metal sectional frames.  They usually do not have enough depth for properly matted images, and they have very limited hanging options.  I might buy them when they are on sale, but just to use the glass.  Aluminum frames are durable, and easy to re-use.  Wood frames require more work in that the artwork is fastened against the glass with metal tabs or points that stick in the wood, and some galleries may require you to seal the backs of the wood frames with a layer of kraft paper.  However, they look nice, and can be painted to match whatever color scheme pleases you.  5. Glass.  This is where the expense can kick in.  You can cut sheets of glass yourself, but it's something that I am not good at.  That's why it is important to stick with some standard sizes, as you can find pieces of 8x10 glass at a thrift shop easier than 9x11.  Plain glass is fine, and there is also special UV glass, and matte-finished glass, too.  Stay away from sheets of acrylic.  They scratch easily and attract dust.Part II will cover sources, and why I like SOME of Ikea's frames."},
{"title": "Odds and Ends, and a special goodbye to Kodachrome", "date": "Thursday, December 30, 2010", "text": "I was going to work on some grand and profound final blog post for the year, but I have so many little things to finish up, that I will spare you my profoundness.  If there has been ONE recurring theme in the photographic world this year, it has been the final demise of Kodachrome.  I swear, between on-line forums and the news media, you would think that the end of photography as we know it was near, based on the angst and nostalgia about Kodachrome.  To be fair, what's  really poignant is that Kodachrome is defined in the age of the baby-boomer and post-war America (well, post-WW II, at least. We have been in some conflict almost continuously since Korea).  Although it appeared before 1940, 35mm Kodachrome became a hobbyist's film in the late 1940s and early 50s when people had more money to spend on photography, and documented their vacations and events on slide film, which then became slide shows to be shown with projection. [I should note that after pro photographers went to Fuji Velvia and Provia, and then digital, Kodachrome once again, became a hobbyist film.] For those of you that grew up with Powerpoint, let me tell you that a Powerpoint slide shown in an LCD projector is NOT AT ALL like a good Kodachrome slide on a screen.  They are almost 3-D - without special glasses.  Anyone growing up in the 50s and 60s and 70s probably attended at least one home slide-show or home movie night (also shot on Kodachrome 8mm movie film).  Most are not memorable, because just like when home videos became the rage, people are not good at editing out the bad stuff. And, if you have sat through slide tray number 3, your mind numb, and eyes glazed over, you will know what I mean about editing.  Just to show that I have indeed, shot Kodachrome (the first being sometime in the early 1970s), here is a scanned image from a slide...  2009 - Lake Superior shoreline near Marquette.Of course, none of that matters now, as nostalgia tends to gloss over the glazed eyes.  Kodachrome was a great film that did not simply fall by the wayside. It has, unlike any other film I know, become a cult phenomenon, and with the last rolls being processed today, has attained an almost mythic status.  Today's article in the New York Times visits Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, KS.  For those that bemoan the loss of processing because they just found a roll in the fridge or in their uncle's closet... don't complain when you are late to a party and the booze is gone. A Pentax ME for Me.Yesterday I was out shooting a bunch of ice and water photos along the Huron River, and afterwards stopped at Huron Camera in Dexter to pick up some processed film. I wandered over to the bargain bins and picked up a beautiful little Pentax ME SE.  I already have a slightly beaten ME that is a great street camera, since it's light, sturdy, and is an aperture-priority camera. The SE version has brown leatherette (I'm not sure how else it differs), and is quite attractive.  The 10 dollar sticker beckoned to me, and I ended up getting it for $5, since it was quite possible that it didn't work at all.  After I got it home, I cleaned it up a bit, put in new batteries, and it sprang to life! I found that I had a spare cover for the motor drive opening in the bottom, and I'll shoot a roll of Ilford Delta 400 in it to test it out.  Adrienne sewed together a new nylon strap to my specifications, and it will be a great street-shooter with it.  Isn't that a pretty camera?I was out at night shooting with Marjorie and Stephanie last week, and used my Canon 1000D and the other Pentax ME.  I shot a roll of Kodak Gold 400 and Ektachrome 100S, which was cross-processed at Huron Camera.  This one image, shot with a center-spot diffusion filter, is my favorite of the evening...Best wishes for 2011 - Who knows what the new year will bring?Edit:  I found this interesting link on YouTube -- an early test of Kodachrome as a movie film, dated 1922!"},
{"title": "Putting the \"cool\" into the Coolpix", "date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2010", "text": "Coolpix 800I was doing some organizing and cleanup at work last week, and rediscovered the ancient (1999) Nikon Coolpix 800 that has been sitting in a cabinet. It was dropped by a student out in the field around 2001, which effectively broke the camera, as the front lens assembly detached, causing it to rattle around in the camera.  You can imagine that I was not happy about it at the time.  Even though it's only a 2.5 MP camera, it was a pretty decent one at that time.  So, it sat hidden away for almost a decade, until I took it out, put in a CF card and 4 batteries, and watched it come to life.  The fact that the lens assembly is loose, made for some interesting effects.  It's basically a shake & shoot camera, as you have to jostle the camera to get the lens in some position to shoot.  That makes for some serendipitous effects, and if you follow my blog, you know how I like that stuff... The photo of the camera above shows the lens askew behind the clear glass front, and it often has a tilt-shift effect.Some results: Me, at work.  at nighttree lights  things rememberedand the coolest shot...  The cover of Mark Twain's autobiography.  I love the way the letters have that zoom effect!  None of these images have been photoshopped.  This is the way they came out of the camera.

I edited the book, and published it on Lulu.com.  I like the fact that Lulu allows you to upload your own design via PDF, rather than have you pick out a design template for the content.  Our book, \"Monochrome In My Pocket\" contains 48 pages filled with photographs from the photographers that participated in the project.  One month is all we had to shoot the images, and overall, I am pleased with the results.  If there was only one thing I wish could be different, it would be glossy paper for the book. However, at $7.50 a copy, it's pretty good and shows what one can do with with a simple camera.

{"title": "Checkered Past", "date": "Sunday, December 05, 2010", "text": "Last week I finally developed an old roll of Kodak Tri-X that I removed from some old camera a while ago.  It was a 20-exposure roll in the old green and yellow cassette that dates from the late 1950's to mid-60s.  The film had quite a bit of base fog, but the negatives were easily scanned.  After I viewed the dried negatives, I started laughing, as every person in the photos, except for an infant, wore a checkered, short-sleeved shirt.  It was a back yard scene, set in June (based on a photo of a peony flower amidst the picnic photos)-- representative of blue-collar middle-class families of that period in time.  The cars, late-1950's models, look fresh, so my guess is between 1958 and 1962.  The place could be somewhere in the Detroit suburbs.The fun thing in these photos are the people wearing the checkered shirts.  Obviously done to possibly honor the grandpa, or else it's a strange cult.  I'm betting on them having a laugh at someone's sartorial choice.   Family resemblance. ace photographer it was a vanilla world  I need more beer!Developing found film and getting results like this makes it really worthwhile. I would say that it's a rarity, because all too often, a camera back gets opened in the intervening 50 years, ruining those latent images from the past."},

Adrienne and I made it an easy day -- and did not go overboard on the food. With just the two of us having dinner this year, there's no point in cooking up too much.  However, the pumpkin AND the pecan pies were very, very tasty.    Before I got the turkey breast in the oven I made a little trip over to Parker Mill and the pathway from Gallup Park.  There was a fog that was up away from the ground, but it gave a soft, sublime feel to everything.  Sometimes, that's just what I want.A little ways farther on the trail, I stopped over at Fleming Creek and really liked the reflections on the water as it flowed over some rocks and branches."},
{"title": "‘Tis the Season... For Exhibits", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2010", "text": "Although I do a fair amount of photography in the winter, it’s not my favorite time of the year to be holding a camera.  However, if winter’s short days and cold temperatures force you indoors, you may as well take advantage of it.  It seems that these things happen in bunches, and here are some upcoming and current photography exhibits that bear visiting.  In the case of the Met... I DEMAND that you visit, um, I mean, make a pilgrimage (what better time of the year to use the word pilgrim!).  So, let me start with that.STIEGLITZ, STEICHEN AND STRAND at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NYC. 11/10/10 - 04/10/11.  Talk about three pillars of photography!  Stieglitz, a photographer of note, but in reality, the man that brought modern art to America.  Steichen, his protege’, who finally rejected pictorialism  and became a master at portraiture and commercial photography (much to the dismay of Stieglitz), and as curator of the MOMA created the famous Family of Man exhibit; and Paul Strand, whose stark imagery redefined the post-pictorialism period.  The two are connected to Stieglitz in oh so many ways. This monumental exhibit should probably be on the list of anyone that loves good photography.  THE MEXICAN SUITCASE at the International Center of Photography, NYC. 09/24/10 - 01/09/11. If you recall the intense excitement of the finding of the suitcase in Mexico with 4500 negatives from Robert Capa, David Seymour, and Gerda Taro that were long considered to be lost, you will want to see this exhibit.   From the ICP press release: “These three photographers, who lived in Paris, worked in Spain, and published internationally, laid the foundation for modern war photography. Their work has long been considered some of the most innovative and passionate coverage of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). Many of the contact sheets made from the negatives will be on view as part of the exhibition, which will look closely at some of the major stories by Capa, Taro, and Chim as interpreted through the individual frames. These images will be seen alongside the magazines of the period in which they were published and with the photographers' own contact notebooks.” TAKING AIM: UNFORGETTABLE ROCK ’N’ ROLL PHOTOGRAPHS SELECTED BY GRAHAM NASH.  Eastman House, Rochester, NY. 10/30/10 - 1/30/11. “Chosen by legendary musician Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills & Nash, this dynamic exhibition showcases some of the most memorable photography in the history of popular music — nearly 100 images by the world’s greatest music photographers, including Anton Corbijn, Lynn Goldsmith, Annie Leibovitz, Jim Marshall, Neal Preston, Mick Rock, Francesco Scavullo, and Nash himself.”Much, much closer to home (for me, at least):AN INTUITIVE EYE: Andre Kertesz Photographs 1914-1969. Detroit Institute of Arts, 11/24/10-04/10/11.  Nearly 100 photographs by Kertesz from his early days in Hungary and Paris, as well as later on in New York. Kertesz remains one of my favorite photographers -- his observant style of photography combines abstraction with elements of photojournalism.  I’d say that this is a MUST SEE.  THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ART OF BILL RAUHAUSER. Detroit Center for Contemporary Photography. 11/13/10-12/18/10. Detroit Center for Contemporary Photography, 7 North Saginaw Street, Pontiac, MI 48342Detroiter Bill Rauhauser is a wonderful photographer that has captured the soul of the area with his camera for 60 years.  You won’t want to miss this retrospective.  However, gallery hours are Saturdays from 1-5 pm, so there isn’t much time left. Detroit Center for Contemporary Photography, 7 North Saginaw Street, Pontiac, MI 48342Class Pictures: Photographs by Dawoud Bey. Grand Rapids Art Museum, 01/21/11-03/20/11. “Dawoud Bey’s photography is community focused and collaborative in nature. Between 1992 and 2007, Bey traveled to six high schools in the Midwest and on both coasts. As artist-in-residence, he photographed students from across the economic, social, and ethnic spectrum. Class Pictures presents forty large-as-life photographs from this project.”Hurry...Light Works: Photographs from the Collection. Kalamazoo Institute of Arts. 09/18/10 - 12/12/10.  “From Eadweard Muybridge's 19th-century photographic studies of animal locomotion to Richard Misrach's contemporary chromogenic prints, this exhibition spans the history of photography. Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Curtis, Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon and many other celebrated photographers will be included in this exhibition drawn from the KIA collection.”"},
{"title": "A Tendril Into the Past - Margaret Bourke-White at the Museum", "date": "Saturday, November 06, 2010", "text": "I was looking through some ancient back issues of \"The Ark\" for some information about a particular expedition.  The Ark was a newsletter published by the UM Museum of Zoology back in the 1920s.  It's filled with a lot of interesting information about the museum before and shortly after it moved to its present location in 1928.   However, I stopped at one page from the March 1923 issue and realized that I had just read an unremarkable statement about a most remarkable photographer.The Margaret (White) shown here is none other than the woman who would later be known as Margaret Bourke-White, one of the great photographers of the 20th century. Of course, nobody at the Museum would have known that the young woman working in the darkroom would become an extraordinary photojournalist, with iconic images on the cover of Life magazine. At that time, photography was still considered to be pretty much a male domain, and it's a testament to Margaret's talent, vivacity, and audacity that she was able to overcome the barriers to women and reach the highest level of her profession.She was a star, and though it is true that her looks and charm may have gotten her into some assignments -- she came away with the goods and got photographs nobody else could get.  Margaret entered U-M in 1922  (after having spent year at Columbia Univ, where she studied photography under the pictorialist Clarence E. White) and originally wanted to study Herpetology. Alexander G. Ruthven, the Museum Director and herpetologist, offered her a temporary job in the museum darkroom, hence the little blurb in The Ark in 1923.  Although studying in the sciences didn't work out for her, Margaret apparently had a life-long interest in reptiles and amphibians.  It was at Michigan where she began photographing and building a portfolio, though she apparently did not regard her early work there as worthy of mentioning in her autobiography, Portrait of Myself.  However, Deborah Gilbert's 1987 article in Michigan Today (first page shown here) provides some details on Bourke-White's two years at Michigan.  I now know that she lived at 915 East Ann and 1052 Baldwin. While at Michigan, she photographed many of the same structures that I, and many other photographers find of interest.  In the 2005 book, Margaret Bourke White: The Early Work, 1922-1930, there are a number of U-M photographs featuring the Cook Law Quadrangle, the Michigan Union, and the campus along South State Street.  The old Museum was barely visible in one photograph, and that very classic building was demolished in the 1950s.  Gilbert (1987) proposed that the dark and murky photos that Margaret took at that period mirrored her emotional state.  It's very likely the emotional scars from her time at U-M stayed with her until she wrote her autobiography, which is perhaps why she didn't mention much about her start at U-M.Margaret Bourke-White's stay at Michigan might have been longer, but she married engineering student Everett Chapman in 1924 and the two of them went to Purdue in 1925.  It was an ill-fated marriage, lasting barely a year.  Margaret left for Cornell University and graduated in 1927.  From there, she went to Cleveland, operating a small studio, and the rest as they say, is history, as she rose to prominence after working for Henry Luce at Time.  ReferencesBourke-White, M. 1963.

{"title": "Short Days", "date": "Sunday, October 31, 2010", "text": "I like autumn and the change of seasons.  The sunlight quality in October/November is different -- while the weather may be warm at times, the sun is low in the sky, and there can be a lot of haze from dust/leaf debris in the air. The light is definitely more \"golden.\" Sunsets can be spectacular, as well as sunrise, and with the sun rising so much later than mid-summer, it's not hard to get out there and catch it on camera.  Of course, this also means short days until after most of the winter has passed, and a change in what I photograph, and when.  Weekends will be more likely to be my only outdoor photography opportunities, and lunch hours during the week. Cold weather is hard on camera batteries and fingers, too.  I'll carry a spare battery in my pocket for the camera if it might require one. As the landscape become more monochromatic, I'll probably shoot more b&w film, too.   Of course, short days also means longer nights, so more darkroom time is a good possibility.For those of you looking to try something different -- fall/winter is a great time to photograph the subtleties of nature in these more northern parts.  The chaos of summer is muted to a few themes in winter.  Colors are more like tones, except for those times when a single leaf or the red of sumac berries stands out amongst the grays and browns. The tiny details seen in a frosted leaf may be as dramatic as a fall landscape.  The are many great things to see, but you have to look.  Street photography changes, too.  Look for those days of chilly wet weather when people are bundled up and more anonymous.  Monochrome works well, and use an all-manual camera to avoid battery problems if you are planning to be out for a day. Try using a toy camera with C-41 b&w film such as Ilford XP-2 -- you'll be pleased with the results.  I took the photo below last year, and just posted it on Flickr last night.  Sometimes the delay from shooting to developing can be a while, and now is the time to show it.  I used my Hasselblad with Kodak Ektar100 film.  The farm is in Emmet Co., MI, and is on my way to Wilderness State Park."},
{"title": "Whirlwind", "date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2010", "text": "The weather over the past 48 hours has been awesome.  While Michigan seemed to be slated for tornadic winds, etc., it was not as dire as the predictors said.  The clouds today were really something -- as was the wind, and I wish I could have taken the day off to go to the shore of Lake Michigan to see and photograph the tremendous waves that were supposed to be piling up.  By the time I left work, the clouds seemed to have parted around Ann Arbor, with banks of clouds to the N and S.  I drove over to Pittsfield Preserve, just outside of town, determined to make a photo with whatever was left of the clouds.  I parked in the lot off of Marton Road, grabbed my gear and saw some trees in the distance that contrasted with the line of clouds to the south.  The harvested soybean field was pretty featureless, and then I saw a small area of grass that had been left alone, out in the middle of the field.  The grass, at times bowed under by the wind, made a moving foreground to show the wind, with the bank of clouds and trees in the background.  I used a polarizer on the 50mm and 70-200 zoom, as the 18-55 lens on the Canon 1000D was 58mm across, and my filters in the bag are 52mm.  Note to self-- keep a 58mm polarizer in the bag!  Anyhow, I am pleased with what resulted, even if it was a whirlwind of a photo shoot."},
{"title": "Two Recent Finds", "date": "Thursday, October 21, 2010", "text": "I was in Lansing on October 12 and on the way back, I stopped at an Antique Mall in Mason, and picked up a forlorn-looking Pentax Spotmatic with a slightly moldy Pentacon Electric 50mm lens.  It was only 12 bucks, and I figured that it needed a good home.  Once I got it home, I realized that the mirror was staying up at speeds below 1/125th sec.  Otherwise, the camera was in reasonable condition except for a missing PC flash connector on the front, and grime and tarnish.  The Pentacon 50mm lens isn't an appropriate lens for the camera as it doesn't stop down automatically for metering.  In addition, the meter doesn't seem to be working, which isn't a big deal.  After cleaning up the camera, I found out what I need to do do fix the mirror return -- some lubrication of an arm beneath the bottom plate may fix the problem.  I'll eventually get around to it and then shoot some film.  I put on a Chinon 50mm 1.7 lens -- which is a pretty good one. It'll make a nice combination. I have owned a series of M42 cameras -- and the Spotmatics are the smoothest of the genre.  In 1980, I used one a trip to the Southwest, and took many Kodachrome and Ektachrome slides in those 10 days. The Spotmatic, all cleaned up: A Pellix, at last!  On Sunday, I was working the MiPHS Photographica Show in Royal Oak.  I did not plan on buying any cameras, but there was a table that had a bunch of inexpensively-priced cameras.  I saw the Canon Pellix for $15, and offered the seller 10 bucks, which he accepted.  This is the first Canon Pellix that I have handled, and it fits in well with my collection of Canon manual-focus SLRs.  The camera I picked up came with a 50mm f/1.4 FL lens, which alone is worth more than the $10 I paid.  The camera was missing a battery cover, and I took one from a non-working Canon TX, put in a fresh zinc-air battery, and the meter sprang to life! What makes the Pellix special is that the mirror does not flip up. Instead, it is a transparent, partially silvered mirror (A pellicle, hence the name Pellix) that reflects some of the light into the viewfinder, and the rest to expose the film.   This would have made a great deal of sense for Canon if the camera were to be used with a motor drive, but this camera does not accept one.  I see it as a way for Canon to try a lot of new things in the marketplace, and one can debate the pros and cons of a a pellicle mirror, but the main problem is that as soon as it gets dirty, the image will be degraded.  The second problem (that Canon tried to overcome by selling this model with a fast lens) is that the viewfinder is dimmer, because not all of the light is reflected to your eye.  In any case, the camera is interesting, and once I replace the light seals, I'll give it a go.  It IS quieter without a mirror slap, but not enough to make it the best reason for trying out the design.  Canon also put a pellicle mirror on the EOS RT - which was supposed to be great for rapid-fire sports photographers.A really good page on the Pellix is maintained by Marc Rochkind. My camera is the first version.  Later on, Canon made a Pellix QL, which featured Canon's \"Quick Load\" system. Now, Sony has introduced 2 DSLRs with pellicle mirrors.  The old Pellix is now a modern camera... It's fun finding a new classic camera!"},
{"title": "A Japanese Import...Sort Of", "date": "Friday, October 01, 2010", "text": "Back in May, my daughter and her partner were in Japan for a 3-week class, and I hoped that they would bring back some film from Japan for me.  I didn't think that they would bring back a camera, though in this case, it was a Fuji one-time use (OTU) camera.  The strange thing is that even though most of the packaging was in Japanese, the wrapper stated that the camera was assembled in the USA!   package front package backOpening up the wrapper revealed a petite camera with a little face.camera frontcamera backIt's a point and shoot, so the instructions don't really matter.  I cannot imagine a 1940s box camera with instructions printed all over it for the user, so it's obvious people have become stupider in regards to handling mechanical things.A few months ago I posted about the Agfa LeBox camera, a simple OTU camera without a flash.  This Fuji camera is much sleeker and has a flash, plus a wider-angle lens. I carried the camera with me to the Toledo Botanic garden at the end of August, and finished off the roll in and around Ann Arbor.  It's so light that it can sit in a shirt pocket without even realizing it's there. So, here are some sample photos.  The film was developed at Walgreen's and I scanned the negatives on my Epson 4180 Photo scanner.One from Dick Alexander's farm...So, overall, the photos were pretty acceptable.  The technology that can make these cheap plastic lenses perform so well within the limitations of the camera is impressive.  The glass lenses on cheap box cameras from the 1950s and 60s were pretty awful, in most cases.  These little cameras produce pretty decent images - a 4x6 print is usually the goal here - so long as they are used under the proper range of conditions (that's probably what the instructions were for).So ends the trip for the camera that was assembled in the USA with film made in Japan, shipped back to Japan, packaged, sold, and then returned to the US! Thanks to Jorie and Stephanie for bring it back with them."},
{"title": "Not Cross at Cross-Processed", "date": "Tuesday, September 28, 2010", "text": "My first experience with cross-processed film was a bad experience.  Back in 1980, I had mailed a bunch of slide film off to be developed, and somehow, one of the rolls was developed in C-41 chemicals, and I got very green prints back.  That might have tinged my view on cross-processing (xpro) just a bit.  Over the years, xpro has been one of those odd bits of photographic practice that when done right, it can be quite awesome and entertaining.  As digital replaced much of the film use, xpro became the \"hipster\" thing, since it seemed so, so...\"Lomo-ish.\"   Then of course, there are xpro filters for digital files, which I won't get into here.  The problem with cross-processing isn't the process, it's the mistaken belief by some that any cross-processed image is inherently better than a normal one.  My belief is that crap photographed is still crap, no matter what color you make it.  (Ektachrome 64T)There are really only two ways of cross-processing -- E6 (slide) films developed in C-41 (print) chemistry, and C41 film in E-6 chemistry.  I do not call developing any color films in b&w developers xpro, for the simple reason is that you are only getting a b&w silver image, not a transference of different colors and saturation.In my opinion, the best results are from E6 films in C-41.  With E-6 minilabs disappearing from the scene today, it is less likely that anyone is going to go the C-41 into E6 route.  In fact, because C-41 is still the only available local process for many people, I would expect that xpro might become more commonplace for people with E6 film to shoot, if the lab will allow it. (I read somewhere that so long as the total rolls of E6 through a C41 minilab do not exceed 20% of the capacity, the chemistry will be fine.)When should one use xpro for E6?  If your slide film is expired, it's a great time to use it for xpro imagery.  If you have Tungsten-balanced film such as Ektachrome 64T, try it with night shots and xpro.  Old Fuji Provia 400 looks contrasty and grainy, and has a very \"vintage\" 1970s look.  There are plenty of odd E6 films to try out, and if your lab will process them in C41, you can have a lot of fun seeing what films give the results that please you the most. Locally, I thank Huron Camera in Dexter, Michigan for doing the cross-processing.Subject-wise I recommend sunny, high-contrast scenes which seem to offer the most colorful and contrasty images.  Subdued scenes can look muddy and exhibit less of an obvious xpro effect. In any case, play around and have fun. (Provia 400)"},
{"title": "Success with the Diana Pinhole", "date": "Saturday, September 18, 2010", "text": "Back in late May, which seems so far away now, I spent a week in Marquette, MI and spent most of my time there doing photography.  I think it was a very productive time, and I ended up with a number of really good images.  Some were digital and some were film.  I sometimes take a while getting around to developing the films from such bursts of creativity, and the last of the 35mm was done a few weeks ago.  Last weekend I finished up the 120 film.  One roll was from my Diana+ (from Lomo), which has the pinhole setting.  I rarely have used that, and I'm not sure why.  Anyhow, I was at Presque Isle, late in the day. Though most of the day (and that week, for that matter) was hot, that evening, an offshore breeze was bringing in cool air from the still cold Lake Superior.  A storm was threatening, and I was hoping to get some dramatic shots.  Well, the storm didn't materialize during the daylight hours, but the cloud buildup was nice. The temperature must have dropped 30 degrees along the lakeshore, and I was getting cold.  My last few images for the day were taken with the Diana.  I set the tripod up along the shoreline and the rocky shore provided some contrast to the lake as it was merging with the sky.  I made a series of exposures -- all just guesstimates on the B setting, of course.  I think the one above captured the scene the best."},

Usually, I look for books on photography and history, and whatever else catches my eye.  That's the fun aspect, as I never know what to expect.

{"title": "A Canon in A Minor - the AF35M", "date": "Sunday, September 05, 2010", "text": "A few posts ago, I reviewed the Nikon One-Touch, a very capable 35mm 2.8 AF camera that is still a pretty decent model to carry along.  This post is about the Canon equivalent, the AF35M.  The AF35M was Canon's first autofocus compact camera, and was introduced in 1979.  The AF35M (also called the Sure Shot later on) features:38mm f/2.8 lensCdS photocell on front of lens assemblyISO 25-400 setting around lensauto-film transport and rewindintegral pop-up flash48mm filter ring active AF system using IR-emitting diodeI picked the camera for a few dollars at the Ann Arbor Recycle/Reuse Center, and it also came with an add-on telephoto lens that I have not tried out.  I popped in two new AA batteries, and the camera worked right off the bat.  My first impression of this camera was that it was a bit larger than the Nikon One-Touch, and the film advance is noisier.  I liked the fact that it has a separate lens cap and accepts 48mm filters - a common Canon thread.  However, rather than trying to find a 48mm filter, simply buy a 48-49mm step-up ring and you can use the more commonly sized filters.  Since the exposure photocell is inside the lens ring, it will automatically expose and compensate for whatever filter you put in front of it.  I did not try any filters for the first roll of film I ran through it.Okay, what about the photos?I shot a roll of Ilford XP-2 in the AF35M, and carried it around with me for about a week.  It's certainly not a bad street camera, though it is a tad noisy advancing the film.  I took the camera downtown, around campus, and to Toledo.  The images shown here are from the Walgreen scans. Alley off Liberty street. Reaching for the door. Toledo Museum of Art Shadows of Summer's End The Yellow-wood tree BJ's and SonsThe AF in the camera works quickly and accurately, and and most of the shots I took were properly exposed.  My favorite shots on the roll were those of the columns of the Toledo Museum of Art.  Although it's hard to tell from the small images, sharpness was excellent, and though the lens is a bit less wide than the Nikon One-Touch, it certainly is suitable for street photography. One drawback is that the maximum ISO is only 400.  That's a limitation for anyone wanting to shoot in low-light without flash.  The Nikon One-Touch will read the DX code up to 1600 ISO film.Final analysis -- The Canon AF35M isn't a great camera, nor is it a bad one.  Not as light nor as capable for low-light situations as the Nikon One-Touch, it does offer the ability to use screw-on filters and accessory lenses, which the Nikon does not.   Just a tad noisy, and heavy, it was the first generation of AF 35mm compacts, which became more refined, with the culmination of the Olympus Epic Infinity in the early 1990s. (A future post).  The push for the manufacturers to produce small cameras with zooms might have been appealing to many snapshooters, but I think a single focal-length AF camera is the best.  They are fast, easily focused, and ready in a moment to shoot.  Perfect for candids and street photos.  While this Canon model might not quite match the equivalent Nikon in all aspects, it is a notch above the slow zoom cameras that later followed.  If you can find a working model for a few bucks, go for it!"},

{"title": "A Little Konica For Ya", "date": "Saturday, August 21, 2010", "text": "I recall reading in 2002, of a b&w one-time-use (OTU) camera that was being sold by Konica.  That article was probably in Popular Photography or Shutterbug magazine.  The review was quite favorable (although in general, most reviews of items sold by companies advertising in photo magazines are favorable, but that's another story) and certainly the OTU market had not addressed b&w very well until then. There is a nice summary on Camerapedia that tells the story of the Konica OTU cameras.Fast forward 2008, when I picked up a half-dozen of Konica B+W for a buck each at a sale. I think I gave some away, and kept one for myself.  I shot some frames on it in the spring of 2008, and again then some time later, and I finally finished up the roll a few weeks ago.  I don't always do this with cameras, but for some reason, if I have a OTU sitting around, it takes a lot longer to finish a roll of film.  Maybe I feel embarrassed to be seen using one.  However, they do fall into the \"Crappy Camera\" category, if only because of their lack of controls and plastic lenses.My general impression is that black and white is the prefect medium for OTU cameras. The C-41 b&w film was the Konica brand in this camera, and  Kodak has their C-41 b&w in a OTU camera.  I have previously used the Konica b&w in a 35mm SLR, but that was about 7 or 8 years ago, and I don't recall my results.  Anyhow, that film is no longer available, but there are similar cameras made in China now being sold with what is probably Ilford XP-2 inside.I am pretty happy with what I got back from Walgreen's.  These images are right from the CD, and are not my own scans.  I do believe that scanning this film on your own will probably have better results.  Cobblestone Farm (probably March 2008): North Quad, UM Campus (July 2010):As you can see, there is some falloff in sharpness at the edges, which puts this into the Crappy Camera camp for sure.  If you adjust the levels a bit, there is some delightful vignetting in some exposures:  UM Art Museum, July 2010The one-time use cameras are actually capable of some decent photography, so long as you don't shoot outside the parameters that they can handle.  Sharp plastic lenses, and small apertures virtually guarantee a decent enough image for 4x6 prints, and perhaps even up to 8x10 if the camera was held steady."},
{"title": "A Little AF from Nikon", "date": "Sunday, August 15, 2010", "text": "Last week I picked up a nice little Nikon One-Touch (known outside the USA as the L35AF2) at a local shop for $15 - with the box and instructions.  Normally, that’s more than I would want to pay for a recent-vintage 35mm P&S camera, but I remember having a similar camera long ago, and thought the results were pretty good then.  Of course, back in the 80s I was not  doing real photography.  Pretty much snapshots at the time. This time around, I thought it might be fun to see what the One-Touch could do.  For starters, it has a 35mm f/2.8 lens (four elements in three groups), and is purported to be of good quality.  Having a single focal length in such a camera is a key.  In my opinion, P&S zooms are too slow and noisy.  35mm is a great overall focal length, as well.  The camera has a built-in pop-up flash, which can be over-ridden by pushing it back down after it pops up, allowing for exposures up to 1/8 sec.  It operates with 2 AA batteries, easily obtainable, rather than those CR-2 batteries that are so common in many compact cameras.   The One-Touch has DX-code sensing, and if any film cassette lacks the code, the camera defaults to ISO 100.  ISO ranges are from 50 to 1600. It dates from 1983-85, and I suspect was a popular compact camera when it was sold.Impressions and ResultsI like the overall feel of this camera, and the zone-style AF seems to be accurate.  The motor drive means easy shooting, and as such, could be a good “street camera.”  With a 35mm field of view, the slightly wider than 50mm is a good choice.   The viewfinder is nice and bright, and the final images pretty well matched what I recall framing in the vf.  The self-timer is easy to use, and of course, a tripod socket will allow for better low-light photos.I shot a roll of good old reliable Kodak Gold 100 and had it processed at my local Walgreens (develop only, and scan to a CD).  The scans look good, and the camera handled the window light at Marjorie and Stephs’ Marquette apartment quite well. Lower Harbor, Marquette 25 cents an hour.Some duct tape neededShould You Buy One?A quick check on the great big auction site reveals a good many L35AF2/One-Touch cameras.  Many are listed as “buy it now” for about what I paid for mine.  It’s certainly a better camera than the pieces of junk that have the letters LC-A on them, and will give consistent results.  It would not be a bad camera to carry around with a few rolls of film on a city stroll, and as it’s not a digicam, battery life won’t be a big issue, so it can sit in a bag for a few months and be ready to shoot.  I recommend buying one and shooting some Kodak TCN-400 b&w C-41 film and you’ll be happy."},

Of course, I know that I will be back up here again, but nowhere near as often as when Jorie was in college.

The photograph above, taken by Ross Orr, shows what are definitely un-crappy cameras-- especially Denis' Leica M6.Last Tuesday we had our monthly Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club Meeting.  I set up the activity for the evening as something to get people out of their comfort zone just a bit.  The rules were simple.  Everyone participating had to bring a 35mm film canister with a roll of film of their choice.  Once we were assembled in front of Huron Camera in Dexter, we placed the film into a bag and I shook it up, and each person then had to use whatever roll of film they pulled out.  We had about 90 minutes to shoot the roll, and meet up back at the Dexter Pub.My reasoning was that we tend to shoot films we are used to, and with advance preparation, we might choose to use a particular film for a specific situation.  When you are forced to use whatever film you receive, you might shoot different subjects or shoot them differently because of the film type.We had a good time, and I ended up shooting mostly along Warrior Creek.  I had taken the wrong camera bag, as most of my 49mm filters that I would use with the Olympus OM-1 were not with me, and all I had was a polarizer.  The film I ended up with was Ilford HP-5 Plus -- a 400 ISO film that is similar to Kodak Tri-X.  Anyhow, I made do, and I think it worked out okay.

After getting the film processed, I realized that I had owned it since at least 2002.  That got me to thinking, and I believe it was from perhaps 2001, when I bought a bunch of them (quite cheaply) for use by some 4-H kids in a class I was teaching.  The first image predates our moving to our present address, so that would place it about right.  Later images are from walks around town that I probably took with my daughter Marjorie, and the rest are images from around the house.  I was not too surprised to see that the negatives were in good shape.  It was a nice surprise seeing the images that I had totally forgotten about. The Agfa color film was quite saturated and I really loved that stuff.  I wonder how many disposable cameras  with latent images are sitting around out there?  I’m sure that not all that many of them are like mine --  “Low-fi art photography”, instead of photos of family and events that most of these cameras are used for.  In terms of image quality, these little box cameras are a pretty good.  So long as you have adequate light, the latitude of the C-41 color film will handle many situations quite well.  As this camera was the version without a flash, outdoor scenes are pretty much it.  Anything more than 5 feet away should be in focus.  The plastic lens is quite good, (the aperture is probably about f/11), so anything up to about a 5x7 enlargement won’t be too bad at all...perhaps even 8x10 if you kept the camera still.   Google is now here.The Le Box camera has been around since the 1990s, and isn’t to be confused with earlier roll-film Agfa Box cameras from the 1950s.   Advances in lens technology and film  make today’s disposable cameras capable of taking photographs with better image quality in a much smaller negative than the box cameras from the past.  Agfa had the honesty to call their little 35mm disposable what it really was -- a box camera. On the Law Quad, 2005? 2006?That brings me to another point.  Since these little cameras are sealed, what can one do to them to make “different” images? They fall within the “toy camera” category, so yeah, it would be fun to try and modify one for some different results.You could:place translucent tape over the lensrub vaseline over the lenstape screening over the lenstape some different colored gels over the lensscratch the lenstry gluing a small magnifier over the lens for close-upsHmm, what else? unknown. home?The front yard, on Saturday.What’s in your Le Box?"},

We had enjoyed some recent rain, and the piece of bark was green with lichen.  I was going to drop it off into the yard, but then I saw the tiniest mushroom I have even seen poking slightly above the lichen.  I knew I had to photograph it.  Later that evening, I set up my macro gear and finally figured out the best way to photograph the scene.   Setting up my Nikon D40 with a Noveflex bellows and focus rail, I put a regular Nikkor 50mm f2 lens on the bellows. A twin macro flash (can only be used manually) would give me plenty of light.  I realized that I had to photograph the mushroom from the side, so I elevated it on a stand and then added a piece of light blue paper for the background.  I shot at f/16 which barely gave me enough depth of field at full bellows extension.This is the setup: and this is a close-up of the bark flap - the mushroom was about 3mm tall!Shooting small bits of nature like this in the \"studio\" is pretty rewarding, as I can control the lighting and position (including mine!) so much better."},

I recall buying it at a local antique shop, but I don't recall if it was mine or hers, but I'll take her word for it.  I do know that I never ran a roll of film through it, so I am doing that now.   The German Braun company made a number of 35mm cameras, and their Paxette series have a confusing array of names, since it seems that many cameras simply say \"Paxette\" on them without additional identifying nomenclature.  The one pictured above is Super Paxette IIL (note - I originally called this a IL, but the fact that it has an interchangeable lens makes it a IIL, according to McKeown's catalog -- and he should know!), a compact rangefinder camera with a nice metal body. Many of the Paxettes have removable front elements that allow interchangeable lenses, like some of the Kodak Retinas.  The rangefinder on this one is out of adjustment, but everything else seems to work just fine.

The MRPP website was created and is managed by Nick Meador, and I have to say that it has had a very interesting series of photo essays by a number of photographers since its inception.  Well, Doug really liked many of my images that had to do with some of my travels around the state, so we settled on a premise of \"Roadside Ramblings.\" Over the course of the past two months, I put together several assemblages of images, and they were pared down by Doug to the set of 16 that are now up on the site.  For me, a photographer that takes many thousands of images per year, on so many different subjects -- deciding on what set of images to show for a particular idea or project is a daunting task.  So, having Doug decide was a good way to do it, and while I might have wanted a different photo here or there, I'll go with his judgment.  After doing some rewrites of the text and finally resizing the images for the parameters of the MRPP, I submitted everything and Nick Meador got it all up on the web yesterday.

I have several friends that given high praise to the OM series, and I have repeatedly read about the wonderful compactness of the Olympus OM-1 SLR.  Last Friday I picked up a box of cameras that had been donated to the Michigan Photographic Historical Society (MiPHS).  In the box, among the digital P&S Canons, the Kodak Autographic, the Instamatic 100, and other items was a brown never-ready Olympus camera case.  I opened it, and inside was a nearly impeccable OM-1 with 50mm 1.4 Zuiko lens and the matched lens shade.  Except for the non-working self-timer, the camera looks like it was bought yesterday.  I figured that I might as well use the camera for a while before selling it for MiPHS.  I believe Olympus built a nearly-perfect SLR for its time.  Yes, I am a camera gearhead, and appreciate mechanical cameras, but I wasn't prepared for the joy of using the OM-1.  Would I have loved it as much if the camera had been a beater?  Hard to say, but this one is really nice.  I put in a fresh 625 hearing aid battery, a roll of Kodak Gold 100 (yes FRESH film this time...see previous post), and shot the roll in 24 hours, mostly around the yard and at Matthaei Botanical Gardens.  There is also a mint 50mm 3.5 macro lens in a case that I tried out, and it worked very smoothly and was fun to use on flowers in the garden.  Results speak for themselves. In operation, the camera was like a Nikkormat that went to finishing school.  The aperture and shutter speed control are located on the lens barrel and lens base and are operated with the left hand, resulting in not having to look away from the camera or move the right hand except to fire the shutter.  Slick.  Match-needle metering, which is my favorite.  I'm not a fan of the green and red LEDs on the Nikon manual cameras.  Shutter sound -- quiet.  The stop-down DOF lever is right where my finger can find it on the lens.  Really easy.Do I really need yet another SLR system?  I can envision the OM-1 as being a perfect street camera with that 50mm 1.4.  Maybe I need therapy.  No, the OM-1 is a lot cheaper than a visit to the doc.  I guess I will have to sell something to buy it, and that Nikkormat FTN is looking kinda forlorn right now...

So, I have been getting up early some days and doing some shooting before the sun gets too high, or else I have been out late into the evening.  Midday usually finds me doing other things, but a camera is always with me.  Yesterday I was in Negaunee and Ishpeming, two old mining towns west of Marquette.  Both have seen better days, and I think one could do a good photo essay or two on bars there.  I did visit a bunch of antique shops, and found a nice vintage print of Wagner falls that looks to be about 75 years old.  Today was really pretty hot and humid, and it was partly cloudy by the time I got out and about.  I hit the beautiful Peter White Library on Front Street in Marquette and read a few newspapers and took some interior shots.  Peter White was probably the most influential person to make Marquette become a city.   The Shiras Room at the Peter White Library.  Afterwards, I drove over to Marquette's Park Cemetery - a truly beautiful place that has a pond amidst the graves.  All the Marquette notables are buried there, and yes, so is Peter White.  I wanted to visit while the graves of veterans had fresh flags and flowers for Memorial Day.  I think I got some good photos there.In the evening, I headed over to Presque Isle once again, and was amazed at how cool it was there compared to around the apartment, just a mile or so away. By the time I was finished shooting I was quite chilled, and the approaching storm was putting up a nice breeze that added to the already cool 58 deg F.  I got some fine shots, despite being cold.

Maybe Canon thought the name \"Rebel\" sells better in the USA?  In any case, the 1000D/Digital Rebel XS is a 10.1 MP APS-C sized DSLR.  It would classify as the low-end of Canon's current camera line-up.  New outfits with the 18-55mm EFS IS lens generally sell for around $550 or less.  I picked my mint-condition outfit up for $355, including an 8-gig SDHC card.    Not bad.As a long-time Nikon user, and owner of a Nikon D70s and a D40, and at one time having owned a FinePix S2, I am pretty used to the way that Nikon DSLRs work.  The Canon isn't too different, overall.  Some controls are placed differently, but nothing that could not be figured out pretty quickly by an experienced user.   The camera has automatic sensor-cleaning, a variety of shooting modes, 2.5 in LCD monitor, diopter control, and many features that one would expect. Oh yes, it also has Live View -- a feature mostly suited for macro photography, in my opinion.The lens, an 18-55 EFS with Image Stablization, has been rated as a very good lens elsewhere on the web, and I have no problems with it.  The camera will also meter with non-Canon lenses on adapters.  So, I actually put a Nikon lens on this, and though I had to focus and set aperture manually, the camera worked in Av mode, which is something my low-end Nikons cannot do.The 1000D handles very nicely, with the controls  pretty logically laid out.  The body feels more plasticky than my Nikon D40, more like the Rebel film cameras.   But, all that aside, what are the photos like?I really love b&w, and having had a taste of  shooting in b&w with my now-gone Fuji Finepix S2, I was curious how the 1000D/XS handled b&w.  I have been shooting B&W with the Nikon D40 (the D70s does not do this), and really liked the results, but they could be more contrasty.  The 1000D renders scenes in B&W beautifully.A little vignetting done on the computer.It's probably on a par with a Nikon D60 in many respects, but better due to the ability to meter with other lenses.  If you are in the market for a \"beginning DSLR\" -- give the Rebel XS a try.  I think it combines excellent features at a low price, and the all-black body looks sharper than the silvery bodies of the older low-end Rebels.More photos...A Canola field off Pleasant lake Road.Some stools at Espresso Royale.  I like the way the highlight and shadow detail work with this camera.Pop on a Canon 50mm 1.8 EF lens (as in the photo of the guys with the press cameras), and you have a nice portrait outfit.  I need to shoot more with the XS to get a better feel for its capabilities, but so far, it has been a breeze to use, and the image quality has been wonderful.  Canon or Nikon?  It doesn't matter, really.  Edward Weston or Alfred Stieglitz?  Now there's a choice one can debate over!"},
{"title": "Senior Show, Senior Daughter", "date": "Sunday, May 02, 2010", "text": "Adrienne and I arrived in Marquette Friday morning for a 24-hr visit to see our daughter Marjorie's work at the DeVos Art Museum at NMU.  It was the closing of the Senior Show, marking 4 years of college for our daughter.  One great thing about art is that there are so many creative people out there, and the Art and Design students at NMU really shine at this event.  Photography, mixed media, ceramics, sculpture, video, painting, illustration, and so much more.  It's not necessarily a statement of what the student has been working on all the time, but what has been prepared especially for the show.In Marjorie's case, she became quite interested in photographing dead animals and her \"Useless Creatures\" project is open-ended.  You can read more about her project here.  One of the things I like about her work is that she challenges the viewer.  Death isn't pretty, but her images DO have an aesthetic about them that demonstrates that dead wildlife are part of the natural scheme of things, and that we should respect them as well.  It was interesting watching some of the attendees viewing her work at the VERY packed event.  I wish she had left a pad for people to record their feelings.  That could have been interesting.My other thoughts revolve around her graduating as a photography and art major from NMU.  Hopefully, she'll be able to apply some of what she learned at NMU in a future job. She's a very talented writer (and knows how to spell), photographer, artist, musician, and knows how to work with databases and library and museum specimens.  I have no idea what she will end up doing in the next few months, as she and her partner Stephanie (also a very talented artist!) will be coming to Ann Arbor in August to live.  Job offers entertained...I'm very proud of her, of course."},
{"title": "No, I am not Ken Rockwell", "date": "Wednesday, April 28, 2010", "text": "Last week, I bought a Nikon D40 refurb from Cameta Camera on ebay.  It cost me $242.  I've paid more for film SLRs, to be honest about it.  Why would a someone that's a fairly adept photographer buy the low-hanging Nikon fruit?  I mean, shouldn't I be buying a D300 or at least a D90?  I already have a well-used D70s that I bought new back in 2005, so why would I want yet another 6 MP DSLR?  Well, my daughter Marjorie leaves for 3 weeks in Japan on May 9.  She has a D50 that I bought for her in 2006.  The D50 was giving her the odd problem, which might be caused by some dirty AF contacts...or not.  So, it's basically insurance should she need another camera body before she leaves.  In the time I have had the D40 (which I originally poo-poohed as a beginner's DSLR when it came out), I have to say that I have enjoyed shooting with it.  For one, it's small and lightweight - meaning it's also a great travel camera.  Two, the rear LCD is really nice for chimping, and the control layout is pretty easy to deal with.  Three, it can take even old non-AI manual lenses (although anything NOT AF requires manual exposure, which isn't a big deal)--so I have been shooting with my 180mm 2.8 AIS lens...and it's fun.  What about only 6 megapixels? I'm not printing murals, and 6 MP is just fine for almost anything I'd use this camera for.  The only drawback with the D40 and its siblings, is that it requires AF-S lenses for autofocus.  If you are in the market that the camera was intended for, that's not usually a problem.  But if you are like me, with quite a few older AF-D lenses, having those autofocus would be a nice feature..but not a deal killer.  But that's typical Nikon -- leaving some features out that probably won't matter to many, but irritating to others.  That said, look for another low-hanging fruit review of the Canon 1000D in the near future.So, yes, the D40 is a nice lightweight camera that I would recommend for travel, vacations, and just carrying around.  I like the color saturation options, including the option of shooting in B&W.  It's considerably lighter and more compact than my D70.  It takes a new battery, the ENL-9.  Photos?  Yes, here are a few...  Taken with the 180mm 2.8 ED AIS manual lens.  Damn, what a fine lens!!  With the 35mm 1.8 G AF-S DX lens. Taken in b&w mode, 35mm 1.8 DX lens.As I said, it's a fun camera."},

Back in February I purchased a Canon AL-1 QF camera.  The QF refers to the \"Quick Focus\" system on the camera.  No, not auto-focus, but a green LED indicator to tell the photographer when the subject at the center of the viewfinder is in focus.  Not really as gimmicky as it sounds, since that is what modern AF cameras do.  Useful?  I believe so, especially for someone that wears glasses.  The AL-1 appeared in 1981, and is one of the A-series of Canons that take modern batteries and the FD lens mount.    The battery door was loose, so I used gaffer tape to keep it closed.The AL-1 features:focus confirmationAperture-priority and manual modesSelf-timerTakes 2 AAA batteries1/60th sec flash syncability to use a power winderOverall, a fairly compact and basic SLR with standard features that make it a competent amateur-level camera.  I found it a delight to use, and while not a Canon A-1, it would make a good backup camera.  Also, for street shooting, it's a winner.

Peter Gowland, 1916-2010.", "date": "Monday, April 05, 2010", "text": "I read in today's New York Times that Peter Gowland, the famous glamour photographer, died at the age of 93 on March 17.  According the the obituary, it was from complications from a fall. Mr. Gowland published over two dozen books on pin-up and glamour photography, and his images were always well-done.  Not only was he an accomplished photographer and author, but he also designed and sold the twin-lens Gowlandflex.  This was a giant twin-lens reflex that was available in 4x5 and 5x7 sheet film sizes.  Gowland was actively photographing and making cameras until shortly before his death. To say that Peter Gowland was an institution would be a fair assessment.  There's nothing wrong with liking beautiful women, but it takes some real talent and great technique to make a titillating, but not tawdry photograph. He was a master of pin-up and as much an icon as the many Hollywood starlets he captured on film.  A long life lived fully. Classy until the very end. You can check out the Gowland website and get a lot more information about his work and tips for shooting glamour, too."},
{"title": "What's in Your Camera Bag?", "date": "Sunday, March 28, 2010", "text": "Not what's ON your camera bag, as in the photo above.  Photographers often put more thought into acquiring a camera bag than they do buying a new appliance.  Camera bags can be very utilitarian, such as the Domke F2 bag, or very specialized, such as some of the photo backpacks or camera sling-packs that are now popular.  I prefer the Tamrac bags because I like the simple design and flexibility of adjusting the inner dividers.  With digital, there are more small bags that are perfect for a P&S camera and a battery and a few memory cards, but can't carry much else. I like to have bags that will accept a variety of cameras:  There is a Holga, a Nikon Coolpix 995 and a Nikon N80 in this bag.  Film - both 35mm and 120, memory cards, extra batteries, filters, etc.  That was for a long weekend when I was traveling with a group and I could take only 1 camera bag.  Of course, for an extendend trip, I don't travel as light:  I think I have about a dozen bags with different cameras and camera systems ready to go.  The Tamrac backpack has the Pentax 6x7 system.  That camera and lenses are heavy enough that after a number of years, I realized that it was too damn heavy to sling over a shoulder (my bad one, especially).  The backpack is perfect for it. The Domke F2 bag is perfect for the \"blad and a few lenses, backs, etc.  I have a small Tamrac bag that looks more like a purse -- but it holds a Minolta light meter, gaffer's tape, filters, tools, and so on.  Sort of like a photo toolbox.  It goes in the car when I am on a longish trip, too.  Back in 2003, Adrienne, Jorie, and I went on a long trip to NM.  I forget exactly how many camera bags we had, but there were a few.  This photo of just the Nikon gear I took, probably required several bags...Looking back on that trip, I took way too much.  I think it takes those kinds of experiences to make one a better photographer.  I don't regret taking all that stuff, since most of it got used. But in the end, some of the most memorable photos were taken by a Holga and an Argus C-3. If I were doing that trip again, I would greatly simplify the gear and reduce the number of bags.  Today, I would probably have three bags:  One with a 35mm SLR (or DSLR) with a 28-105 lens, 50mm, and 80-200 (or thereabouts).  A lensbaby, and maybe even one more wide-angle lens or a dedicated macro lens.  One small bag with a rangefinder camera (Minolta 7s) and some film.  Another bag would possibly have a TLR and a toy camera or two.  Or something like that.  I forgot about the 'blad..."},
{"title": "Some thoughts on the Canon EOS (film) SLRs", "date": "Saturday, March 20, 2010", "text": "I've been a pretty dedicated Nikon user for the past 10 years, ever since I got serious about photography.  Canon, pffft....  Well, I am sure Canon users said the same about Nikon.  However, when it comes down to images, you can't tell what camera was used to take the photo.  So, really, aside from the idiosyncrasies of any particular camera system, it comes down to personal preferences, and whether or not a system provides the flexibility one needs.  In favor of Nikon, the lens mount has changed little in 50 years, as has been reiterated many times.  Canon, on the other hand, departed from the breech-lock FD-mount and went to a new AF lens mount that basically made anyone buy all new lenses, or search for an adapter.  The good news, is that the Canon EF-mount has a lot of adapters available for other systems. Not so for Nikon.  Nikon lenses don't seem to have the two-tier system that Canon has.  Canon's cheap lenses do feel cheap.  Their L-series lenses are pro-level and command a higher price, as well.  So, the two stalwarts of the SLR wars each offer something for somebody.  I won't discuss the DSLRs as I have not used one of Canon's models.  However, lately, I have added a couple of Canon EOS film cameras to my \"collection.\" I previously blogged about my inexpensive Canon Rebel-G.  Well, a little while ago I bought a Canon EOS Elan II body on ebay for $10.52 + shipping.  That camera has turned out to be a real gem, as I like its ergonomics, control layout, and the viewfinder is nice and bright.  Obviously the mid-level camera in the EOS film lineup, and a significant upgrade from the Rebel series.  It also works with a Nikon adapter, so I will try out some Nikkor lenses on it.A little note on the the Rebel-G.  I bought a 50mm 1.8 lens for it, and the combo must be one of the most lightweight SLRs out there.   I did some shots with it last weekend, and it was a lot of fun to use.and with the 24-50mm Sigma lens:In the end, the Canon Rebel  SLRs are perfectly capable of providing excellent results.  You really can't go wrong with Nikon or Canon, and the digital deluge is causing excellent film cameras to be sold at a fraction of their original cost.  Black and white film has never been better, and these cameras are certainly a lot lighter and a breeze to shoot with."},
{"title": "In Pursuit of Ice", "date": "Saturday, March 06, 2010", "text": "I drove out to Dexter-Huron Metropark this morning to see if I could get some photos similar to some very serendipitous images I got about a year ago.  We had some pretty cold weather in early March after a bit spring thawing had gone on.  The resulting ice was filled with bubbles that created some amazing abstract images.  Like any natural phenomenon, it's never the same, and as the saying goes, lightning rarely strikes twice.  However, anyone engaged in a long-term photographic project will tell you that preparation and persistence always pay off.  For one, the conditions were not the same as last year, but I did enjoy the cool morning -- the snow, no longer acting like snow, but more like shaved ice that you would use in a snowcone.  I was able to walk on top of the slowly shrinking layer of snow and make my way down to the river.  The tracks of geese from the previous day were frozen on the surface of the snow at the water's edge.  Once by the river, I kept looking for an area of ice that had formed overnight and had some frozen bubbles trapped in it.  There were not many spots, but I found the one shown at the top.  That singular area was no more than a foot wide.  I found a few more in some flooded low areas that had frozen, and those provided the additional \"drama\" of leaves below the ice.  While I was setting up my gear, I heard the unmistakable sound of Sandhill cranes somewhere nearby.  A delightful moment, for sure.I was shooting with my recently-acquired Canon A-1 and various lenses, as well as the G11.  The A-1 performed well, and I'll develop the Tri-X tonight to see how I fared.   It's easy to just stay in bed on a Saturday morning, and I know I have gotten somewhat lazy the past couple of years, not jumping up at dawn to take advantage of the light, like a nature photographer should.  But it's easier to do with a project in mind, and like most people, I work best when I am inspired. Be inspired.  Be prepared. Be successful."},
{"title": "Thrifty Shooting", "date": "Wednesday, March 03, 2010", "text": "I picked up this Canon Rebel G SLR with a nice Lowepro camera bag, remote shutter release, manual, strap, and 35-80mm lens for $38.01 on ebay.  Sure, it's a low-end Canon film SLR, but it's lightweight, has a huge array of lenses, and it is like-new condition.  In fact, I actually picked this up because of the camera bag, and the rest was really a bonus.   I know I'll get some crap about this from a few Nikon-toting friends, but imagine being able to buy a modern film SLR for less than the price of a battery for your digital camera.The point I want to make here is, electronic film SLRs have many, if not most of the features of their digital descendants.  If you find yourself wanting to play with film, and have never done so, a 35mm film SLR that is similar to the DSLR that you have been using makes sense.  You won't have to learn a new layout or different controls, and unlike using a classic all-metal SLR (which are my favorites), the newer cameras are lightweight, compact, and don't add much weight to your bag.  So, if you are wanting to try out a lightweight 35mm SLR -- consider a Nikon N80, or a Canon Rebel (not the digital kind).  Pop on a 50mm 1.8 lens - new ones for either system are less than $100, bring along a few rolls of film (Ilford's XP-2 for C-41 b&w, Kodak's Ektar 100 or Fuji Superia 400 for color) and you are ready to go.    So, watch ebay, Craig's list, or whatever.  People are selling off their plastic-bodied SLRs for a fraction of the original price.  Be patient or just lucky, and you may get an even better bargain than I did."},

The evening went very well, and I had a lot of good exchanges with the audience.  I delved into the art history aspect of the Diana, some of the common threads in what I call \"Neopictorialism\" and an overview of many different toy cameras and images resulting from them.  I think the main aspects to embrace about toy camera photography are:funserendipitylow-cost maximum effectnon-threateningcreativityI'm sure you might have additional bullets to put on that list, but I think those are the major points.  When I say non-threatening, I mean that nobody will take you seriously holding a Holga 135BC or a Diana, or a dollar store camera in your hand.  What a great way to photograph the street.  Walk out there with a DSLR and a zoom lens and see how people may react differently.Low-cost.  I think about the die-hard digital crowd that says \"I can do that in Photoshop.\" Go ahead and make my day, punks.   Let's see, you spent $1000 on your camera and lens and goodies, another $1000+ on your computer, $600 for Adobe software, and you haven't even taken a photo yet.   Maybe you spent less, maybe more.  The point is, I (and many others) paid less for the crappy camera and film than you did for a 72mm circular polarizing filter.   Plus, I had the shot as I exposed it, not doing some post-PS work to make it look different. It was that way already.  Not just different, but unique, and the effect of the lens aberrations and quirks is maximized when used with  film. Be creative. In fact, no two of my crappy cameras have the same effect.  All are different.  Knowing how to use those primitive boxes with limited exposure options are what makes them a tool worth having.  They may not work for everything, but when the situation arises, they are wonderful cameras for conveying a slightly surreal, dreamy, or totally altered view of what's in front of the lens.From my work with many toy cameras, I think one that deserves another mention is the Holga 135BC.   If you don't process your own b&w film, load it with Ilford XP-2 or Kodak's CN-41.   Processing of 35mm is readily available, it's small, you can adapt it for series filters, and it has a Bulb setting, too. Both photos taken with the Holga 135BC, Ilford XP-2 film."},

{"title": "The wider view - 35mm in your Holga", "date": "Monday, January 18, 2010", "text": "Last month I bought a 35mm adapter kit to use in one of my Holga cameras. The ebay seller in China was offering them as a Buy-It-Now with shipping for about $13.  I figured that I may as well go for it, as the prices elsewhere were much higher.  A few weeks later the item arrived in a neat little package.  It consists of a new back, mask with film holder, and two stickers (more about them later) for the wind knob, as well as an instruction sheet.Now, there are ways that you can use 35mm in a holga with minimal purchase.  Tape over the red window, make a mask yourself, etc., and there are instructions online for doing just that.  All of them are somewhat kludgy, and this kit is pretty simple and straightforward.1. Remove the existing camera back and the 6x6 or 6x4.5 mask that is already in place inside the Holga.2. Insert the new 35mm mask -- it basically gives you a 24x55mm (excluding the sprocket hole area) negative.    Note that the 35mm canister fits into a niche on the left side of the camera.3. Insert film canister and tape end of film leader to the 120 take-up spool.  Start winding the film onto the spool and then attach the new back.4. Now you are ready to go and shoot some film.The 24x55 negative size is slightly longer than a frame and a half.  Not quite what one would consider \"panoramic\", but it's not bad, and gives me a whole different type of image from the Holga.  It's obviously better than the cropped 24x36 image that is called \"panoramic\" with the point and shoot cameras, which is about 12x36mm.  Note that in the photograph above, I used an old roll of film that I have used before to  test out winding schemes with 120 cameras and 35mm film.  That's why there are marks on the film.  If you simply wind the film for 36 clicks of the winding knob, you will get no overlap on your images.  However, as the rolled film gets fatter, the images will be spaced out unevenly, unless you reduce the number of clicks as you shoot through the roll of film.  That's what I found out before I realized what the stickers are for.When you wind on to the first exposure (determined by the \"1\" on the knob, and then to the second, note that it's almost a turn and a half, or 36 clicks.  From 2 to 3, it's maybe 34 clicks, and so on in decreasing order, so just pay attention to the numbers on the wind knob as you progress along the roll of film.  That will keep the frames evenly spaced apart.Now what?  Once you get to the end of the roll, you will need to have a black cloth film changing bag or a darkroom so that you can open up the camera and remove the cassette, still with the film attached to the winding spool, and then rewind the film back INTO the 35mm cassette.  It will look like this (but since you are in the dark, you should not see THIS.DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT open the camera to rewind the film in the light.  You will lose all your images.  This may seem obvious, but after reading threads on Flickr, I no longer believe common sense has permeated the latest generation, especially one that has only grown up with digital.Once you have removed the cassette, you can either develop the film yourself, or if it is C-41 or E-6, take it to your local processor, and make sure that they DO NOT CUT the film strip after developing!  These are not standard 24x36mm frames.  Nor will they be able to print them.  That, my friend, means that you will have to scan them yourself.  If you shot regular b&w film, you'll have to make a mask for your enlarger  (just mask a 6x6 holder) as the standard 35mm film mask won't get all the image.This is a lot of fun.  You will have to frame your subjects in the Holga viewfinder so that the center contains the image you want to shoot.I look forward to doing more with this!"},
{"title": "Mellow Yellow?", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2010", "text": "I was at the local Urban Outfitters before Christmas, and I picked one these cameras up for my daughter.

{"title": "First Impressions on the Gakken-Flex", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2010", "text": "In early December I purchased a Gakken-flex kit from a Flickr contact (mijonju) in Japan.  The Gakken-flex, for those that must never have looked online, is a 35mm twin-lens reflex plastic camera kit.   It's a shame that there are no equivalent US magazines like that of Gakken's Otona no kagaku (大人の科學) magazine. However, the US-based MAKE Magazine is now selling many Gakken kits online, including the stereo pinhole camera (next on the list?).  The Otona no kagaku magazine (#25) has a wonderful-looking section on the history of photography and twin-lens reflex cameras.  I wish I could read Japanese! For the relatively modest sum of $58, which included 2-day shipping, I had the kit in my hands in time for my birthday, as a present to myself.  However, it wasn't until last weekend that I finally assembled the camera.  First of all, if you have assembled any plastic models in your spare time, you don't need to be able to read the instructions.  While there were some places in the assembly that I had to think about before proceeding, the camera went together with relative ease, and I am impressed with fit and finish of the plastic parts.  All you need in the way of tools is the small Phillips-screwdriver that is provided in the kit.  Forceps are useful for holding small springs or screws in place, so you may want to get those out if you have them.  There is a misprint in the instructions where the springs A and B are mislabeled, but if you look at the assembly diagram, you would realize that the functions of those springs are such that it's easy to figure out.  (Here is the correction).  Anyhow, I probably had the camera together and working in about 45 minutes.   It's important to test the sub-assemblies before you screw everything together so that you know how things work.  That's the beauty of building your own camera.The lenses are geared to focus together, so what you see on the frosted plastic waist-level viewfinder should pretty much be what you get on film.  The lenses extend far enough from the film plane that you can close-focus to about 18\" from the camera.  If you have some series 5 or 6 filter holders that are about 25 mm (viewing lens) - 27 mm (taking lens) in diameter, you can put diopters, neutral-density, and color filters in front of the lens. I loaded a roll of Kodak Plus-X pan (ISO of 125) into the camera the next day, and shot a roll.  Note -- the camera has a nominal aperture of f11 and a shutter speed of about 1/150 sec.  On a sunny day, ISO 100 film should be just fine.  Also note that it might be ambiguous in the instructions that you only need to advance the film 1/2 turn, not 1 full turn.  That is why there are two index marks around the film advance knob.  I did a full turn, just for safety's sake and after developing I realized that a 1/2 turn was all that was necessary.Photos?  Oooh, what dreamy goodness!  After shooting only about a dozen shots on my first roll, I think I have a good idea of what to expect in  the future.  The lens is a single-element, so there is aberration and dreamy out-of-focus areas when you shoot close-up.  Even for shots at infinity, the focus seems to have places where its sharp in the center and OOF around the edges.  There is some vignetting close-up.   The magazine has easily deciphered hints on modifying the camera, including making a square mask. Expect more images from me later on , but I give this fun little camera a definite thumbs-up.  There is a Flickr group, of course!"},

In the spring of 2007, we had Cheap Shots at a gallery on the second floor of Nichols Arcade.  It was a tremendous success, and we gained a bit of exposure because of it.  Since then, we have had some smaller shows, though the one in the fall of 2008 at the Argus Building was certainly very much a large group effort.  This year, we are showing Cheap Shots II - Recycled and Reloaded at the ReArt Gallery, located within the Recycle Reuse Center at 2420 South Industrial Road in Ann Arbor.  It will run from Jan. 4-31, with the show reception being held on Jan. 9 from 2-4 pm.The main emphasis for this show wasn't so much that of using \"crappy cameras,\" but that of using cameras that were obtained second-hand, at thrift shops, reuse centers, flea markets, etc. to show that old film cameras are actually part of recycling and reusing.  In addition, the frames, glass, and some of the mats are recycled, many obtained right from the Recycle Reuse Center.  Mike and JohnI finally got all the cats herded, and Mike Myers and John Baird helped me hang the exhibit today, and it looks pretty darn good.  There are 24 images from 11 photographers, and all of the prints are really pretty darn nice.    A wide variety of imagery, and I think others will like it as well.  Heck, maybe someone will even buy a print.  I really like getting a show like this together, and once I had the pieces of work in hand or on the way, I felt pretty relaxed about it.  another wall..."},

Other than shooting with a Canon T70 for a month, and  borrowing a Canon Rebel 35mm SLR and using (for years) a Canon Canonet 17, that was the extent of my film shooting with Canon cameras.  Although I have managed to acquire and use a number of SLR systems, Canon has not bee one of them until very recently.  A week ago, I picked up a Canon FTBn from a fellow A3C3 member, Kevin Mount, for $30, which included the 50mm 1.8 Canon lens.  I put in a couple of Zinc-air cells and the meter immediately sprang to life.  The camera is rock-solid, much like a Nikon Nikkormat from the early 1970s.

It was not even a megapixel camera, as the images were no larger than 640x480 pixels.  But, I was probably seduced by the cute rainbow apple and the ease at which I could upload an image onto the web.  The fact is, I probably would have been a lot farther ahead to have taken the money I spent on that camera and used it to buy a really neat film camera!  I think today's 5-dollar keychain cameras take photos with about the same resolution.  The point is, don't be seduced by new technology, just because it's new. Instead, wait for it to become mature to the point that it does not limit the way you would do things. When I think of the images that I took with that camera that will never be larger than 640x480 pixels, I could kick myself.  The Quicktake 200 originally sold for $600, but I'm quite sure that I paid far less for it, because Apple stopped marketing cameras in 1997. Some history about it is here.I don't imagine that I sold it for a whole lot in 2002, but I bet whoever bought liked that shiny rainbow apple..."},
{"title": "A Tale of Two Ponies", "date": "Tuesday, December 08, 2009", "text": "Kodak has a long history of interesting names for its cameras.  Brownie, Instamatic, Ektra, Medalist, and so on.  At some point, it seems that they had almost as many film formats as camera names.  In their effort to corner the consumer market, they had a camera and film size for every niche.  During the Great depression, people were not buying as many cameras, and certainly were not using as much film, so someone got the great idea of selling a camera that was small, inexpensive, and held only a small roll of film.  Let's see, 8 shots per roll should do it -- that might be two Christmases worth of photos in some households.    So, the great minds at Kodak came out with the Bantam series of cameras with a new film size - 828, which is based upon the width of 35mm film.  However, instead of the film being placed into a daylight-loaded cassette, it was placed on a spool with backing paper like 127 film, the next largest roll film size.  Bantam - as in small (bantam roosters, bantam-weight boxers, etc.), meant that the collapsible Bantam cameras could easily be placed in a pocket, and the fairly sharp lenses in those cameras gave reasonable results.  The Bantam camera first appeared in 1935, and the famous Bantam Special, designed by that great Art Deco designer, Walter Dorwin Teague, appeared in 1936 for the grand price of 110.00.  Not exactly pocket change during the Depression.  The Bantam Special was discontinued in 1948.  Today, that beautiful, if largely unusable camera regularly sells for $200-$300.  What does any of this have to do with ponies, you ask?  Well, in 1949 Kodak introduced a well-made camera called the Pony 828.  That camera used 828 film, and I believe was the last model to use 828 sold by Kodak. The Pony 828 originally sold for $30.00.  That's still a nice amount of money for a camera back then.   The Pony 828 was sold for 10 years, and was replaced by the Kodak Pony 135.  The example shown here, the model B, first appeared in 1953 and was in production for 2 years, when it was replaced by another Pony 135 model.  Pony 828 on the L and Pony 135B on the RNote that the Pony 828 has no rewind knob and frame counter, as it uses a green window on the back to keep track of what frame you are on.  Like other roll-film cameras, the film just rolls from a supply spool to a take-up spool, and then you remove the completed roll for processing. Definitely not a design for anything more than a very casual photographer!Note that the Pony 828 (bottom) is smaller than its 35mm successor:The other difference between the 828 and 35mm versions is that the 828 negative is larger than the 35mm model.  Bantam negatives are 28mm tall x 40mm long, whereas 35mm is 24x36mm. Noticeably larger, but not like 127 film.   Within the constraint of the format, the Bantam negative is actually pretty good.  Taken in August 2009 at my house with the Pony 828 on 40+ yr old Verichrome Pan (828) developed in D-23 for 6 minutes.I shot the roll of Verichrome Pan and expected mediocre results if only because of the age of the film.  I wasn't worried about the lens, as that same lens and shutter is found in both Pony cameras:and I knew from experience with the Pony 135 to expect fairly crisp images, so long as the zone-focus scale was set properly.A shot from the Pony 135B, taken a few years ago.It's pretty obvious that the Bantam film/camera category had limited appeal. The folding Bantams were stylish, but lacking in features, and apart from the Bantam RF and the Bantam Special, were easily eclipsed by 35mm cameras.  The Kodak Pony 828 was the Bantam's last gasp at the \"low-end\" of amateur cameras.  I somehow got hold of a Pony 828 when I was in college and shot a roll of Kodachrome 25 with it-- and I still have the slides.  The other spoiler for the 828 film was that I know of only one other US company that produced cameras taking that size -- Argus.  The Argus Minca  (or Model M)had a short life, being a pretty basic and cheap camera.  There was also the Coronet Cub (out of England), but I have never seen one.The Kodak Pony 135 cameras are generally pretty decent cameras, and were emulated by the Argus A4.  The only Pony to avoid is the Pony II, as it uses an EV system  (like the Argus C3 Matchmatic) with limited exposure options.  One last shot from the Pony 828:411 Lofts in Ann Arbor, March 2009."},

Marjorie and Stephanie treated us to a fine Thanksgiving dinner that was different from any that we previously had -- all vegan.  I found myself not missing the turkey at all.  Of course, a trip to Marquette would not be complete without doing some photography.  I traveled light this time, bringing only a Nikon FM2N and 3 lenses, a Yashica A TLR, and my Canon G11.  A visit is never complete without a stop at Presque Isle Park - and a place that is always different.  The wind was howling pretty good along the lakeshore, and the waves were pounding the breakwall.I didn't take any photos on the West side of the park, as the wind and driving snow was too fierce to even think about taking out the camera!The next morning after Thanksgiving, I went over to the Dead River N of the city.  There was a thin layer of snow on the ground, giving everything a crisp look.  The light - very flat - was great for reflections off the river.I shot two rolls of b&w with the Nikon, so it will be fun seeing how those came out."},

That carefully composed nude of Charis Wilson by her then lover, Edward Weston:  Charis died last Friday at the age of 95.  She was an amazing woman, and there is no question that she helped Edward Weston enormously.  He very likely would never had gotten a Guggenheim grant without her writing it.  Charis' \"girl-next-door\" beauty and Edward's photographic genius became a synergy that possibly was Weston's best period of work. She was his muse, his model, and collaborator.  Who has looked at the image above and not fallen in love with it?  A chaste yet sensual image, it's probably the most accessible nude photograph.  One of many that Edward took, and unlike a pepper, needs no interpretation.Charis and Edward have been the subject of a number of books by others, but it was her autobiography that told the real story. Through Another Lens My Years With Edward Weston by Charis Wilson and Wendy Madar tells the story from the woman that was there.  One cannot help feel a little sad about the parting of Edward and Charis, but she had outgrown Edward, and Charis moved on to another life, and a very long one at that. I was greatly moved by a recent documentary and hearing Charis' voice tell her story was riveting.  At her advanced age, she retained the grace that she seemingly always had. If you are interested in seeing that excellent DVD, Eloquent Nude is available online for $25.  There is also an interview with Charis from 1982 at the Smithsonian Archives.Charis Wilson may have passed on corporeally, but she'll never grow old.  That, is the beauty of photography."},
{"title": "Medium-Format Fisheye Fun", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2009", "text": "I have no doubt that there are \"Lomography haters\" out there, but whether one loves or doesn't love the Lomo folks, there is no denying that they have introduced some fun into film-based photography.  I reviewed the new Diana+ quite a while ago, and yes, it's a cheap plastic camera, but I saw that they had cleverly added some features, such as the pin-hole and removable lens.  Now, I see where their design has paid off.  Back in October, I purchased the 20mm Diana Fisheye lens (as well as the Nikon SLR adapter, but that's another review) from Lomography online store.  I felt it was a pretty cheap accessory with a potential big fun factor.  I give big kudos to the Lomography people for their colorful packaging and fun aspect of their products.  Really, there is no understated yellow and black box here. The box contained the 20mm  fisheye lens, a cleverly-designed accessory viewfinder, front and rear lens caps, a carry pouch, and instructions.  The accessory finder easily attached to the Diana+ camera, as did the Fisheye lens.  I suspect the finder is the same as the one on the 35mm Fisheye 2 camera.  It gives a pretty good approximation of what you'll get with the new lens.   The lens close focuses to within a foot of the camera, which is pretty darn cool, though most of my shots have been made of subjects 2 meters or more from the camera.OK, so it looks cool and funky, but how does it work?  Let me first say that I think the image quality surpassed my expectations.  Second, to get the full circular fisheye effect, you need to remove all the masks and shoot full-frame (12 exposures).  Otherwise, the negatives will be cropped a bit.  Third, this is a lot of fun to use.I took a bunch of images back in mid-October, and these pumpkins were among my favorites.  I took some shots for World Toy Camera Day, and this one of the top of the spillway at Barton Dam is kinda neat.  You can see the bridge in the background.The Diana Fisheye lens ought to be great for shooting in tight spaces.  Sure you will get fisheye distortion, but if that effect appeals to you, then go for it!Take in my garage at the studio night for the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club.Overall, I would rate the 20mm fisheye as one of those accessories that justifies the purchase of a camera.  There is no doubt that the Diana+ is a fun camera.  But, having a circular fisheye image on 120 film is a real blast.  I can't wait to make some darkroom prints from some of those shots."},
{"title": "Who We Were - a review", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2009", "text": "Who We Were - A Snapshot History of America by Michael Williams, Richard Cahan and Nicholas Osborn. 2008. CityFiles Press, Chicago, IL. ISBN:0-9785450-1-x  hardcover, 240 pp.  45.00The people at the website Square America -- a treasure trove of found, vernacular photographs -- put together an engaging book with the title \"Who We Were - A Snapshot History of America.\"  With photographs ranging from the humorous to the tragic; from the round photographs from the original Kodak (taken from a surrey, no less) to a Hasselblad photo from the moon, Who We Were is a delight to read. Once George Eastman made photography available to the average person, the era of snapshots began.  No longer would families sit stiffly at a photographer's studio, dressed in their Sunday best.  The snapshot became the way to document the ordinary, as well as the extraordinary.  As with any technology, some folks were better at photography than others, and as cameras became easier to use, everyone in the family could become the photographer of family activities.  Thus, the rise in photography also mirrors the changes in American society, as families became more upwardly and territorially mobile.  The snapshot became a way to keep families abreast of events as they spread apart.  It's no surprise too, that as families became more disconnected, the snapshots that were once important to one part of a family, became scattered to the winds as family members died off and distant relatives had no appreciation for the photos taken \"back in the day.\"  That sets the stage for the Square America authors, as well as all other collectors of vernacular photography.   It's one thing to collect old photographs, but providing some perspective on them is a more difficult task, sometimes requiring a fair amount of keen detective work to provide a narrative about the image.Who We Were accomplishes the above quite well.  With over 300 photographs, starting from the 1890s to the 1970s, this book chronicles the larger changes in American society by showing the small events that shaped it, and were shaped by it. Some of the photographs are chilling -- a massive KKK parade in some city in 1922; burning oil wells straight out of Dante in 1930; an approaching tornado in gritty black and white.  Others will make you laugh, as girlfriends, boyfriends, spouses, and parents appear in snapshot form.  Others are revelatory. A photograph of tenant farmers in the South picking cotton with a sharecropper's house in the background is every bit as effective as a photograph by Walker Evans.  Whomever took that photograph may have had a different agenda, but the image is no less effective at showing the situation.The photographs in this book are reminders that our past isn't so different from today in that people are interested in pretty much the same variety of things --  our children, the opposite sex, funny events, relatives, pets, work, interesting events, vacations, wars, and all the events that impact us.  The clothes, the houses, the transportation, and the technology may change, but we are not so different from the people in those images.I really enjoyed the narrative of the Who We Were, and the photographs selected for the book really do provide a time-line of US history that is palpable, as the images are based on those taken by the average person.  They were not taken by a news photographer, FSA artist, or professional, but the people impacted by or participating in the events.  That is a people's history, which makes it all the more interesting. If you go to the Square America site as of this writing, there is a $15 discount on Who We Were.  My book also came with a DVD with vintage home movies on it, as well as a snapshot!"},
{"title": "Black is Sexy - The New Canon G11", "date": "Sunday, November 01, 2009", "text": "And so is the new Canon Powershot G11...I have been looking for a new high-end rangefinder type of digicam.  There are a lot of times that I don't always want to use a DSLR, or I am out shooting film cameras, and a pocketable digital camera would be a good asset.   I used to own a Canon Powershot A570, and although there was much to like about it, it was a pain to use it manually, what with all the menus.  On top of that, it was a small camera, and I found the small buttons a bit bothersome at times.  In addition, the start-up was slow, and I eventually replaced it with a Fuji Finepix S700.  I gave the Fuji away to a deserving photographer, and replaced it with a used Nikon Coolpix 8700.  A good digicam for doing many things, but it's not really compact...and it's slow.  I love it for doing ebay shots.So, after I had sold off a bunch of photographic items, and amassed a nice Paypal balance, I started looking at reviews of higher-end point and shoots, as well as the new Olympus EP-1.  I had forgotten about Canon's lineup.  As tempting as the Olympus camera is, I don't like the lack of an optical viewfinder, and the camera and lens would have set me back $900.  That's real money.  Not as much as the drool-inducing Leica M9, but that's not even something I could aspire to afford.  So, I started looking around a bit more, and the new Canon G11 really appealed to me.  I liked the idea of it being only 10 megapixels,  the flip-out LCD screen, the optical viewfinder, and the CONTROLS.  Real twisty dials to set ISO, exposure compensation, mode, and the 28-140mm (35mm equivalent) zoom fits perfectly in most of my shooting.    So, I ordered one from Beach Camera (and they take Paypal!), and it was at my door in 2 days, with free FedEx shipping!  It came yesterday, and and after I charged the battery and reviewed the manual, I was ready to fire away.First impressions:LCD image is awesome!  Easy to navigate menus and optionsISO dial, exposure comensation and mode dials are metal, and bring back the build one expects in a good rangefinder cameraI like the built-in ND filterLightweight, yet feels like I have a real camera in my handsI can use an external flash...and results are very goodOptical viewfinder is pretty good... certainly not 100%, but I can use it for street shots.Colors and clarity are very, very good.This is certainly an expensive (for me) \"point and shoot\".  At $499, it's obviously the top of the line in Canon's P&S stable.  The difference between it and the Canon A570IS that I used to have is easily seen.  There is a reason why the G10 became a favorite camera of many pros, and it's obvious that the G11 has improved on its predecessor.  Canon did something almost unheard of -- they reduced the megapixel count from the previous iteration, and by all accounts I have read, it has increased the quality of the images at higher ISOs.  So far, I have barely put 200 shots through the camera, so future shots will be taken at higher ISOs. I'll be giving the camera a more thorough workout, but today, I took it on a walk in Parker Mill County Park and found it a lot of fun to use.  Next time I'll bring a tripod to try out that ND filter the way it should be used... long exposures of moving water."},
{"title": "Praktica Makes Perfect", "date": "Monday, October 26, 2009", "text": "I worked all day yesterday at the Michigan Photographic Historical Society's (MiPHS) sale tables, and sold a ton of stuff for the Society.  I didn't venture out and about the floor at the Royal Oak Elks Lodge all that much, so I don't have a report on what interesting items were at the sale.  I did however, stop at one table where the vendor had a box of several Praktica SLRs.  These cameras were all made in post-war East Germany by K.W. (I'm not going to spell it out, but you can look it up), which was later absorbed into Pentacon VEB.  The Praktica FX3 was made between 1956 and 1959, and lacks an instant-return mirror.  It has a M-42 lens mount, and shutter speeds from B- 1/500 sec.  As you can see here, it has a \"waist-level\" (WLF) viewfinder.  Not the most Praktical way to photograph with 35mm, but it works.  I decided that I had to have the Praktica, as they have always intriqued me, and it was in good working condition, or at least it seemed to be.  The lens is a Carl Zeiss Jena Tessar 50mm 2.8.  Anyhow, I cleaned up the camera last night and took it out today and shot a roll of Kodak Gold 100.  The WLF takes some getting used to (though my first SLR in 1974 was an Exa IIa, and it had a WLF), and I am sure bifocals don't exactly help.  Of course, you have to wind the film to reset the mirror.  One one hand, the WLF should be good for street photography, since it is not obvious what you are photographing. On the other, it sucks for vertical shots.  I dropped off the film earlier this evening at Walgreens, and picked up the CD an hour later.  I'm impressed not only with the sharpness of the images, but my sunny-16 metering skills haven't diminished (ha! you say, yeah but it was C-41 print film...). I have a few other M42 lenses to try out with it, but the Tessar is a good lens to stick with.A street vendor at the edge of campus.A Ginkgo tree at the Museum:A look at Cobblestone Farm:The front door there:Overall, I'm impressed with the results.  It'll be a challenge shooting with this camera, since the WLF does take some time to get used to and adjusting the focus really requires use of the pop-down magnifier.  On the other hand, using f/16 and prefocusing for street photography should yield some interesting images."},

{"title": "Fun With Sun", "date": "Sunday, October 18, 2009", "text": "I was surprised when I walked into the local Barnes and Noble bookstore  a few weeks ago and saw a cyanotype printing kit by the front door.  Cyanotypes are one of the oldest alternative photographic processes that are easily done, and combined with modern digital techniques, remain an accessible  way to make original art from photographs (more on that later).   You might have seen the original \"Sunprint\" kits in catalogs or in gift shops.  The kits were really nothing more than a dozen sheets of 4x4\" blueprint paper, a rectangle of  acrylic, and a sheet of instructions for making prints.  I used larger sheets years ago when I did a workshop with 4-H kids.So, I purchased this attractively packaged kit for $14.99 (it was less with my B&N discount card), and opened it up after I got home.  It's a nice little introduction to cyanotypes, and what sets it apart from the \"Sunprints\" package is the included book by Kate Marlowe.  Sun Exposures,  A guide to Low-Tech Photography is a nice introduction to photograms, alternate processes, and low-tech cameras, such as pinholes.  I was surprised by the small book, and it's obvious that this kit would make a nice gift for budding photographers and anyone that enjoys the hands-on of DIY photography.The kit includes the book, sheets of cyanotype paper, and acetate overlays to create some different photograms.   The back of the book has a list of resources and suppliers for those that want to do more with cyanotypes and other photographic techniques.  I think it's $15 well-spent.You don't need to just use some flat objects to make photograms to have fun with cyanotypes.  You can shoot digital and use a  graphics program to make a digital negative, which you print on overhead transparency film (denser negatives work better) and then use that to produce a positive cyanotype.  Or, you can scan in a film negative and do the same.  Or, you can find antique glass photographic plates and make prints from them on the cyanotype paper.  Of course, larger negatives = better prints.  Anything larger than a medium format negative (6x6 cm) will be suitable.The other beauty of cyanotypes is that if you use blueprint paper, all you need is water to process them.  No darkroom needed.  Cyanotypes remain a viable artform, and you only need to go to the Alternative Photography website to view  some nice work.  The Detroit Institute of Arts has held cyanotype workshops in its new wing.  One web resource has videos showing how to make your own cyanotypes.So, all you really need now is some sun.  I see it it's going to be a sunny day here (finally).  Time to go make some prints!"},

However, as a photographer, and an avid reader, I enjoy reading truthful and insightful  writings about the craft and creative process of photography.  I also enjoy seeing good photography presented in a way that inspires me and engages my creativity and my thinking.  In that vein, if you have never read an issue of LensWork, I encourage you to do so.  Of all of the modern photography publications that I have read, I think this one comes closest to being about the art of photography, and not the nuts and bolts of geardom, processes, and current trends.  In other words, it's the end result that inspires me. It's sort of like seeing a great exhibit in a museum somewhere, except the photographs on the wall are by people somewhat like me.   In addition, the commentary is very good, and the editor, Brooks Jensen, may just be one of the best  essayists around when it comes to photography. It's not an easy publishing environment right now, but it seems that Jensen is finding a way to make  LensWork  uh, work.  Unfortunately, there are no longer any copies available on news stands, but if I understand the decision to sell only by subscription, they are not losing money with unsold copies.    It's the one magazine that I eagerly anticipate in the mail.  If you love making photographs in b&w, and enjoy seeing well-crafted images, you should subscribe to LensWork.But wait, there's more!  Brooks Jensen has published several books on photography and the creative process.  I have read two of them -- several times over, in fact, and should be required reading for photography students.  \"Letting Go of the Camera\" and \"Single Exposures\" are quite possibly some of the most honest writing that I have seen about photography and the entire creative processes surrounding it.   As my title says, they are photographic jewels and belong in your hands.  Jensen finds ways to sell photographs, to put them in the hands of viewers, to make them accessible, and to make them affordable.  Is there is a disdain there for galleries?  Yes, of course. But, you should read  Letting Go of the Camera to find out why, and you'll probably find yourself nodding in agreement.In addition, Brooks Jensen also does podcasts, which offer his commentary about photogrpahy and creativity.  Certainly worthwhile listening to.[Disclaimer  here -- In no way, do I profit from telling you to subscribe to LensWork.  It's just a damn fine magazine (though calling it a magazine is almost demeaning) about photography that will inspire you.]Finally, I have to add that the recent issue (July-August 2009) was nothing but a delight to read.  It honors the memory of Bill Jay (1940-2009), by presenting a number of his columns  that appeared (and some that never did) in LensWork .  Some might think that Bill Jay was a curmudgeonly old photographer, but he died too soon.  His writing, sometimes pithy, was totally full of truth and often very humorous.  I can see why Brooks Jensen had him write for LensWork.  Truth, humor and beauty, all in 96 pages."},

After seeing some of Andrew Moxom's superb images at Photostock this year, I realized that I had to find one.  There are not too many \"crappy\" cameras that have the features of the Great Wall (hereafter referred to as the GW) DF-2.  Shutter speeds B, 1/30, 1/60, 1/125, 1/200; helical focusing 90mm lens with f3.5 - f22 apertures.  Single-lens reflex viewing with a \"waist-level\" finder.  The camera is largely based upon the German-made KW Pilot  Super camera of the late 1930s.    I did not have a manual, but Moominsean's blog was very helpful, and he has already discussed the history and use of the camera, so I won't bother repeating it here.So, with some excitement, my first time out with the camera was the steam train festival in Owosso, MI.  I figured that I might get a few good images there, and I shot some expired Techpan (ISO 25) and some old Verichrome Pan.  Old film, old trains, wacky camera.  A good combination.This woman was dressed in a vintage outfit, and damn I got her perfectly with the waist-level viewfinder.  The out-of-focus areas are really dreamy.This isn't the equivalent of a Hasselblad, a Kowa 6 or any other MF SLR.  It's in its own class.  Elegant crappiness.  I really like the fact that the lens has a 52mm filter thread so that I can add close-up lenses..and with the SLR viewing, no parallax problem!

I guess it would be a good idea to buy a bunch of fresh Delta 400 and use that, though, especially if I want to shoot with 120.Just for kicks, I checked my Flickr photos for images tagged with Delta 400 and found quite a few.

{"title": "Fruits of Labor", "date": "Friday, August 14, 2009", "text": "\"Why do we photograph?\" Is a good question.  It calls into play a lot of reasons, some of which involve the documentary nature of photography.  To convey an event through our eyes.  To share what we see, how we felt, what we did, so that we won't forget, so that others won't forget, and so on.    It's not necessary to defend why we do it.  We just do, and sometimes events unfold that justify whatever reasons we had for hoisting that camera.  For a number of years, from 1984-2002, I spent a week or so at the Huron Mountain Club, NW of Marquette, MI, doing entomological research.   A number of papers were published on the insects that I worked on, and I'm quite happy with what I did there.  I also carried a camera with me out in the field just about every day.  In the 1980s it was a Pentax MG, and in the 1990s and 2000s, I used Nikons and several medium-format cameras.  Some of the images I took later on were related to my research, but many were not, as I knew that my time there was coming to an end, and I wanted to document some of the beauty of a place that very few people outside of Huron Mountain Club members and  researchers (working under the auspices of the Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation) get to see.Some of my images were placed online on my Flickr account to share.  Last year, I was contacted by History Works, Inc. to use some of my images for a book documenting the history of the Huron Mountain Wildlife Foundation and the research that has taken place there.  I was happy to donate a number of images, and finally, today, I received a copy of the book in the mail.  Having one of my photos grace the cover was proof to me that all the shots I took of Ives Lake were worth the effort.  I was never content to just get one shot, to document that I was there.  As anyone knows that photographs seriously, you go back to some spots to shoot repeatedly because there is always the chance to get a better image than you did before, to capture something a bit different.  So it was with this image.    One thing I did notice when providing images for the author -- my photography greatly improved after 2000, when I began taking it seriously and thinking about what and how I was shooting.  Those later images comprise most of my photos in the book.I have over 15 photographs in the book and it's really great to see them in printed form-- a better venue than sitting closed up in the file cabinet inside sheet after sheet of slide pages."},
{"title": "Bond Falls", "date": "Tuesday, August 11, 2009", "text": "Aug. 5, 2009.  Nikon F3HP, 28-80mm AIS Nikkor lens, 4x ND filter, Ilford Pan-F.Bond Falls, located in the west-central Upper Peninsula is one of those places that many photographers have visited, and a few photographers have made iconic.  The step-like nature of the falls and the easy access (due to a series of steps and pathways all around one side and at the base of the falls), really make it a pleasure to photograph.  I can set my tripod and camera up for great angles, and whether it is a close-up of a small cascade or the full view from the base, as seen above, it's hard to get tired shooting there.This was my second visit there, and I have much better technique and tools available to me since my first visit.  The weather was largely the same -- bright sun.  I can't control the weather nor could I choose a later time of day.  However, with a 4x Neutral-density filter and a red filter, I was able to get shutter speeds as slow as 8 seconds, using Ilford Pan-F rated at ISO 32.   The only problem I had was people.  There is easy access to the water, and all kinds of kids were frolicking in the water near the base of the falls.  I was patient, and got the shots I wanted when they moved on.  I had to laugh though.  This couple in the photo at the top was fly-fishing in the same area where the kids had been splashing around.  Dressed like they stepped out of an Orvis catalog.  Fishing there?  I think they made for a great shot though, and I hope they had better success elsewhere.However, fishing -- like photography, is similar in some respects.  Success is often determined  by the time of day, your patience, and your technique.    Sometimes the tools don't matter, but using the tools at hand to their fullest will often make success more probable.  Luck plays a part sometimes, but I'd like to think that it's the prepared that are lucky.  In this instance I think I had more luck than the couple fishing."},
{"title": "Porcupine Mountains Trip 2009", "date": "Friday, August 07, 2009", "text": "Overlooked Falls, Finepix S2I have lived in Michigan for a few months more than 28 years.  I have made numerous lengthy trips to the Upper Peninsula, and have been all over it -- except for one area, the Porcupine Mountains.  Finally, this past week I made a brief visit to the Porkies with my wife Adrienne, my daughter Marjorie, and her GF, Stephanie.  We stayed at the Superior Shores Resort, in a nice cottage right on the shoreline of Lake Superior.  It was a nice base to have, to able to make our meals there, have the waves crashing not 70 feet from our bedroom window, and be just a short drive from the Porcupine Mountains State Park.  It was nice having Steph and Jorie prepare the meals, too. Jorie and Stephanie, shot on Ektar 100.We went on several forays to view various waterfalls, hike some trails, and enjoy nature.  The weather was excellent, never really hot, and although we didn't hit every spot, I think we came away wanting to see more next time, which is a good thing.  Photographically, I kept my equipment fairly simple for this trip -- a recently acquired Fuji Finepix S2 Pro (which I found on ebay for $220), 18-50mm, 50mm 1.8, 70-200 Nikkor, lensbaby, and various ND and polarizing filters; Nikon F3HP, 50mm 1.4, 24mm 2.8, 90mm Tamron macro, and 80-200 f4.  Also brought my \"new\" Great Wall medium format SLR that I bought on ebay from a seller in China.  Oh, and a Bogen tripod w/ball head -- it is my lighter of two Bogen/Manfrotto tripods, and in retrospect, wish that I had brought the heavier one.I really enjoyed shooting with the Fuji Finepix S2  -- ergonomically better than my D70, with sensible controls and the ability to also shoot b&w.   I still need to do more work on some dirt removal from the sensor.  Makes me think that my next \"new\" DSLR might be a FinePix if they come out with a full-frame version.  However, that's a way down the road.   I shot three rolls of Kodachrome 64 -- the last of it that I will ever shoot, so doing it on a vacation is a very fitting end of such a unique film.  I'll send those off to Dwayne's photo for processing next week.  Look for images sometime in September.The waterfalls are varied, ranging from small intimate falls on Union Creek and the Carp River that are very photogenic, to quite large falls on the Presque Isle River.  Outside the park, we found Bonanza falls on the Big Iron River, which were a favorite.  Farther west, we briefly visited Conglomerate and Potawatomi falls on the Black River.  However, you can't really get close to those falls, as the viewing platforms are high above the river.  Probably a good thing at high water. So, our favorites were smaller waterfalls that we could explore from every angle. one aspect of Bonanza FallsIf you want to capture the water over a long exposure, use at least one ND4 filter and your lowest ISO setting.  I suggest using a polarizer and an ND4 filter for best results unless you are shooting very late in the day. Greenstone FallsOverall, it was an excellent, if short trip.  I think if I lived in the UP, I would be out shooting almost every day."},
{"title": "A Shot In The Dark", "date": "Sunday, July 26, 2009", "text": "Ektachrome 400To be honest, it was many shots fired in the dark.  Last Wednesday night, Marc Akemann and I went on a little night-photography adventure in Ann Arbor.  We shot mostly in the State Street area, concentrating on the exterior of the Univ. of Michigan Museum of Art, and around State and Liberty near the State Theater.   Marc was shooting with his Bronica, and I of course, as usual, had several cameras that I was shooting with -- my Nikon N80, Ricoh R-1, aand my 35mm Holga.  Tripods in hand, we walked around until it got dark enough for some artificial-light shots.  Mark with his Bronica.  Ektachrome 64T.One of our aims was to shoot with slide film and get it cross-processed in C-41 (color print film) chemistry.  It's bad enough to shoot the variety of light sources at night with any slide film and get realistic colors due to the various color temperatures of neon, tungsten, halogen, and sodium vapor lights.  Daylight-balanced slide film such as the Ekatchrome 400 I was using will give odd renditions in such conditions, but it was funny how the cross-processing actually looked pretty darn good.  Same for the Ektachrome 64T (for tungsten lighting), though some of the images had a more pronounced greenish cast to them.  UMMA and people playing with the \"swing\"  Ektaachrome 64TFinally, I shot some Superia 100  color print film in the Ricoh R1 - a wide-angle P&S camera that is normally about 30mm, but goes to 24mm in Panorama mode.  I shot some Kodak Gold 200 in the Holga 35BC, but haven't developed that film as yet.  Ricoh R1The Ricoh was a pleasant surprise with accurate exposures and good color.  Obviously having it on a sturdy tripod also helped.  I'll be interested in seeing how the Holga 135BC shots came out.You are probably wondering why in the hell I'd be shooting film and not digital for night scenes.  Serendipity and fun.  You see, digital is way to easy for this.  I like the delay in gratification, and because each film has a different characteristic, the results were uncertain.    Add in the cross-processing, and one gets a totally different color rendition, depending on the exposure and the film.  In addition, I bought the film at 50 cents a roll, and developing was only a few bucks.  Thank you, Huron Camera (in Dexter, MI), for doing C-41 cross-processing!"},
{"title": "It's done... Stick a Fork In it", "date": "Friday, July 24, 2009", "text": "It's done...Originally uploaded by mfophotos. Last night,  I read my last copy of the Ann Arbor News.  It was filled with self-congratulatory stories, articles on the history of the paper, and some images of the hard-working people that no longer have a job.  No matter what anyone at the News said, or management at the new Ann Arbor.com is saying,    I still believe that we, as a community have lost something far greater than just a paper.  It was a sense of community (even though in recent months it was obvious that local in-depth news coverage left something to be desired), and connectedness.   I still believe that non-local ownership had more to do with closing (just as with  Pfizer,  and loss of the Arborland AATA bus transfer station) than advertising revenues.   The Ann Arbor News is no more, and that is sad. Next to it, I also had a copy of the new Ann Arbor Journal, a weekly paper. This is only the second issue, so I am interested in seeing how it evolves.    The first thing that caught my eye were the less than stellar photos.    As someone that appreciates the finer points of photography, there is a big difference in professional photojournalists/news photographers from anyone else shooting without that background and training.  It's not as easy as it looks, and techniques aside, it's the eye that good photographers have for a scene that can turn the most mediocre of events into something interesting.  I will great miss Leisa Thompson and Lon Horwidel of the AA News.  Their photos were distinctive and always well-done.  I wish them well at whatever new directions their careers take them.I will miss my daily paper, and I'll read my comics online.  But it's not the same as sitting down at the dining table and sharing the paper with my wife Adrienne, and making comments about what we are both reading.  I will not go to AnnArbor.com.   It's a matter of principle."},
{"title": "Good Things Happen... An all-black Argus C-4", "date": "Wednesday, July 08, 2009", "text": "From Random Camera BlogLast night, at the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club meeting, Mike Myers brought in a box of cameras donated by a local resident to give away to people at the A3C3.  The donor's father had apparently worked at the Argus Corporation, and brought items home with him from work.  She was going to throw the stuff out, but found the A3C3 address, and called Mike, and he accepted her donation.  So, Mike talks to us about the donation, and opens the box next to me at the table.  I looked in, expecting to see a bunch of dilapidated old cameras, and saw this all-black camera that looked strangely familiar!  I picked it out of the box, and stared dumbfounded for 10 seconds.  It was an all-black Argus C-4  -- one of those Holy Grail type of cameras that we all covet, but thought we would never see, much less afford! I could not believe my good fortune, and I think Mike may have opened the box next to me so that I would find the camera first.    The all-black C-4 is rare.  Less than 10 are known to exist, and here was one staring back at me!  I accepted my prize, and found the leatherette in the box that had fallen off the back.  The camera is in good cosmetic condition, though the shutter had seized up.  Not a problem.  I don't plan on shooting with this beauty.  It is obvious the previous owner did shoot with it, as the hot shoe is brassed up, and the focus ring on the lens has some grime that comes from being used. It's the first variant of the C-4, with a round viewfinder window, and round raised area on the back, and a M-F switch for flash.  The shutter speeds go to 1/300 second, and there is no serial number ANYWHERE on the body.  A prototype?  The camera is in very good cosmetic condition.  I think I owe Mike a dinner somewhere."},
{"title": "Good-bye, Bill", "date": "Monday, July 06, 2009", "text": "Last week, I visited my friend William L. Brudon for the last time.  He was in hospice care, and sound asleep when Adrienne and I visited.  It was hard for me to see Bill in a state that was obviously closer to death than living.  However, he was pain-free, and I'm hoping that his mind was in the dream state that he had talked to me about a few months ago.  Today, Bill passed away in the morning, quietly, and gently.  He was 87 years old.   I don't know if he ever was able to read the last letter that I wrote him last month, or if his wife Margaret read it to him and he comprehended the contents.   I'd like to think that he did, and was pleased about what I had told him of upcoming photography projects.There are a lot of things in my head regarding Bill.  Amazing to me that in 10 years, so much has happened.  I knew Bill on the downward slope of his life, unlike many other people that had known him far longer.  Up until the past year, his mental acuity was good, but other health problems basically made it impossible for him to draw or paint, or even to hold a camera.  That had to be very frustrating to man that had been doing those things his entire life.Bill meant a lot to me -- I always thought of him as a father figure -- someone that could tell a good joke, laugh at a pun, and tell me what I didn't know.  He was full of stories, having been in that generation that WWII defined, and though he never graduated from college -- he was the epitome of someone that made great use of their talent.  If you do a Google search, you'll see his name on several textbooks of human anatomy and cranio-facial books.  He was a renowned medical illustrator at the University of Michigan, and before that, a natural science illustrator.   But that's not all -- he could paint lovely landscapes (and in fact, used to exhibit in the early days of the Ann Arbor Art Fair), nature scenes, and knew photography inside and out.  He was an ardent bibliophile -- and I have been the beneficiary of some of his library.  I have also been the beneficiary of a lot of his photographic equipment, not to mention that my wife and I bought his house in Ann Abor in 2002, which included a nice darkroom.  Bill was special to me.  He shared his knowledge freely, and was generous with his time to someone that also had a passion for something he cared about. Bill, 2004.I knew of Bill long before I met him.  His artistic and photographic skills at the Museum of Zoology (where I work) were legendary.  He left there in 1960 to pursue a more rewarding career in the Medical School.  I met him in the late 1980s, and became reacquainted with him when he volunteered for the Ann Arbor Flower and Garden Show in the early 1990s.  My wife saw him more than I did at that time, and when I re-entered photograaphy, determined to learn about macro-photography and to take it seriously, she mentioned to him that we should get together.    From that point on, in late 1999, Bill and I became goood friends.  He became a mentor, and taught me about art and photography, and was an honest critic of my work.I wish I had known Bill much earlier in his life -- he had throat surgery before I knew him, and his voice was raspy (and easy for me to imitate -- I'll always think of his \"Hey there, young fella.\") and as he aged it was harder for him to speak loudly enough and long enough for a conversation  at times.  After we bought the house, and were going through things he'd left behind, I found a casette tape from the early 1970s, and played it.  I was astounded to hear his real voice -- a mellifluous, kind voice that I had never experienced in person.Even though we shared a passion for photography, we went out shooting together only once - in November 2000, we went over to visit Dick Alexander at his farm near Manchester.  I took a bunch of photos then of those two telling stories and laughing away. Bill took photos of me and of Dick as well, and I have those.   Bill kidded around with me and often called me \"son number 3\" and he enjoyed being called Dad, though in my letters I addressed him as Daddy-o.  Bill made a difference in my life, and I, in his.Bill's generosity of cameras and equipment made it possible for me to get a sound start in macrophotography. As I progressed, and it became clear that I was really serious about photography, Bill would pass along another camera or lens or book to me. Just last week, I was using the Pentax 6x7 that he gave me in 2001.  So, it's impossible for me to not think of him when I'm out photographing.I don't believe in an afterlife, and I'm not religious.  I do believe that we are remembered by our deeds and by our life's work.  Bill's prodigous, if unglamorous, scientific artistry has been seen by thousands of people in the medical professions.  His art lives on, and serves to educate others.  He was more than an artist, a photographer, a bibliophile, an astute student of the civil war, a philatelist, a tinkerer, a calligrapher, a story-teller, a teacher, a father, and a husband.  He was, and always will be remembered as a good friend that has held a most special place in my life.Bill, in his studio at Silver Maples, 2004."},

I went last year, and had a wonderful time, and this year was better, in many respects.  For one, I had met many of this year's participants last year, so I did not feel like an absolute newcomer.  Secondly, I brought a bunch of my work to show, so others would get a better feel for the many kinds of photography I do.   Third, Bill had a great photographer, Shelby Lee Adams, as a speaker and guest, which was a highlight of my stay there.  Fourth, I found some new places to photograph and came away with some very good images!  The first night, I stayed at a house on Burt Lake, owned by my friend Joan Doman.  That is a place that Adrienne and I have been going to for many years, and I was glad that it was available that first evening.  The rest of the time I would be staying in Harbor Springs at a cottage owned by a friend of Marc Akemann's. There was a big hatch of Mayflies going on at Burt lake, and there must have been millions flying around, which is kind of strange when they are landing on things, including me.   I set up the FinePix on a tripod and took some long exposures.

{"title": "No Surprise Here... Kodak Kills Kodachrome", "date": "Monday, June 22, 2009", "text": "As paraded about online by a variety of news sources and bloggers, and of course, Kodak itself,  EKC has announced the discontinuation of Kodachrome. I know there are some angsty, angry people here and there, but anyone that's serious about photography saw this day coming long ago.  I'm surprised that it has taken this long. I was more upset about the killing of Panatomic-X and Techpan (I have a big stash) and Verichrome Pan.  With Kodachrome, I give a shrug, and will make sure those two undeveloped rolls of KR-64 that I have get sent off to Dwayne's in Kansas real soon.  You'd think that being a film lover, I should shed a tear over the demise of Kodachrome.  But, I am not.  Let's be honest here.  In the grand scheme of things, shooting transparency film has been on the decline with today's digital cameras.   Kodachrome, being a niche product, has been declining in usage for years, to the point that only one place in the entire civilized world can process it.  For those bemoaning the loss of Kodachrome, I have to ask how many rolls a year do they shoot?  It's not in 120 size, which is what I am shooting if I am going to be using transparency film.   If Dwayne's Photo in Kansas got wiped out by a tornado tomorrow, there would be no processing ever. Finis. Done. Dead. Gone.  Sure, I liked the film, I recognize its quality, but I also would rather Kodak keep improving and offering us more films that I use on a weekly basis, and can get developed easily, such as the Ektar 100.  I would be horribly upset if Kodak dropped B&W films.  Those are something that digital does not replace.  Color, however... A found slide from Kentucky, 1956.  Wiscasset, Maine, 1976. In its day, Kodachrome set the bar for color, and millions of weekend photographers documented their vacations.  National Geographic showed us the world through Nikons, Leicas, and Kodachrome.  Edward Weston made some beautiful 8x10 Kodachromes near his home. Aside from its archival properties, as evidenced by its 74-year run, it's a complex process that is not terribly environmentally friendly.  Color-wise, it preserved the post-war America, and for that, I am grateful.   It's time to move on and keep buying Kodak's newer films.  I'll look back at Kodachrome fondly, but I'm not crying about its loss. Grayling, MI, 2006."},

The most widespread and esily obtained model is the FTN.  With  the metal-bladed copal square shutter, and speeds from B to 1/1000 sec and a center-weighted 60:40% meter, it is a dependable workhorse of a camera.  The only downside, is the use of mercury cells for the metering, which can be overcome with one of the C.R.I.S. adaptors to allow the use of silver-oxide batteries - well worth the expense. Mine still has a mercury cell in it.I have been shooting with it again -- using color print film, and getting it developed and scanned at Walgreens.  I paid 50 cents for the film -- expired Kodak Gold 100, and $5.15 for the develop and CD.  The results are outstanding.  Fun how a nearly 40 year old camera with cheap film can still compete with the DSLR for image quality.Our garden, early evening, on tripod with about a 1/2 second exposure.

I had a great time at last year's event, and met lots of excellent and dedicated photographers.  In anticipation of that, I have been trying to print a bunch of images, many of which were taken last year.  Sometimes I am \"in the zone\" when printing, and things come out looking great, but the past few outings into the darkroom have not been one of those times.  I blame myself for this, as I should be in there more frequently, and I confess that I have been scanning more negs than making darkroom prints.  That's come round to bite me in the butt.   Images that I scanned in previously have not been as impressive on paper.   Anyhow, I'll work through this, and have a bunch of prints to bring up with me on June 24.  I better get cracking, though and no excuses.  At least hockey season will finally be over Friday night, taking away one more distraction..."},

{"title": "The Olympus Stylus Epic -- Photography in Your Pocket", "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2009", "text": "There are some cameras that have many devotees.  Take the renowned Olympus XA series, which I reviewed earlier.  Those small 35mm cameras are proof that a small 35mm camera with a bit of automation, good design and excellent optics will provide one with a serious picture-taker.  The XA series were eventually replaced with a more modern, sleek and automated Olympus Stylus Epic. The streamlined Epic, with its 35mm 2.8 lens is a far cry from the general run of small-aperture p&s cameras from the 1990s-2000s.   Because of the built-in flash, DX-coding, autowind, and autofocus, the Stylus Epic is a very complete little camera.  I recall reading several times in Popular Photography that it was the camera that \"pros\" kept in their bags when an SLR wasn't going to be able to be used.  So, I guess that makes it a pocket pro camera.The only problem I have is that the default on the Stylus Epic is to have the flash activated.  So, before shooting, you have to press the flash button twice to deactivate it to keep it from going off.  Pretty embarrassing if flash photography isn't permitted at the location, and most of the time flash isn't needed.  Other than that, the camera autofocuses quickly, and is a pleasure to use.  I keep mine handy in my messenger bag, where it sits in a pocket probably designed for a cell phone. I like the security of the sliding lens cover, and the single focal length of 35mm is really ideal for me.  Really, it is a camera capable of being used for serious street photography -- without looking serious.From Grand Rapids, November 2008.Ann Arbor, May 2009.

Well, at least the small world of photographers using pinhole cameras did.  Our world is sometimes a bit fuzzy, but everything is in focus, and we expect events to happen at a slow pace.  Mike Myers and I went down to the Irish Hills along US-12, in search of some suitable WPPD subjects, and found some decrepit places to shoot, such as the Irish Hills Fun Center as shown above.  Formerly a place where one could race go-karts, play mini golf, and take a dip in a pool, it now looks abandoned.  The one place I really wanted to see has all sorts of life-size dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals on the grounds, but it is ringed with \"no trespassing\" signs.  Better to stay out and avoid a visit from the local police.We finally ended up at McCourtie Park in Somerset.  This place was built by a former concrete baron, who, in the 1930s, had artisans from Mexico construct a series of small concrete bridges across a meandering stream.  You might think it wouldn't be interesting, but each bridge is different, and they fool your eye -- looking like rustic wood brdges, a rope bridge, and so on.  What looks like bark with beetle holes is just concrete. You expect the rope bridge to sway, but of course, it's not really rope, it's concrete.  Fun to visit, and quite photogenic."},
{"title": "Gifts that keep on giving", "date": "Monday, April 20, 2009", "text": "Last month, I was given a spectacular gift by an old friend.  My one-time photographic mentor, Bill, is going to be moving to Hershey, PA, with his wife Margaret.  Bill's not doing so well, and has not been able to use any of his wonderful cameras for a while.  I'm helping him a bit, by visiting and getting him to remember events and his long-term memory isn't so bad, but short-term varies greatly.  He's already parceled out most of his gear to his grandson (a pretty good photographer), and his sons, and of course, to me as well.   I'll try and help him deal with some of his remaining gear and books, etc., but I know it'll be frustrating for him.  Of course, I will miss him once he leaves the area, and there is always that unspoken acknowledgment that there are not many years left in him.  I'm more accepting of that than to see a fog descend over someone's mind, and render memories into fugitive moments that may or may not reappear.I do what I can to keep Bill's mind engaged-- I send him a typed letter every week or two along with a photograph to let him know that I am very much engaged in photography.  I know he appreciates them, as he has mentioned that more than once, and unlike a conversation, he can read them again and not have written words fall off into a chasm.Bill had previously asked me if I had a Nikon F3, and that he had a case of Nikon gear that I should take with me.  I had always delayed the topic, feeling that he had already given me so many great photographic things, that I felt guilty about bringing it up.  In late March, we talked at length, and Bill told me to go to the closet and pull out the aluminum case that had the Nikon tag and take it with me.  We would get to the other bags and boxes at a later date before the move to PA.  I was hesitant to even look in the case, but when I opened it, and saw the mint F3HP and FM2N and lenses, I knew that he had probably run film through those cameras only a few times each.  It was my duty to become the custodian of that equipment and use it and appreciate it, just as Bill would have if he'd been able to do so.So, just as Bill's other camera gifts  to me  gave me so much enjoyment over the years, the Nikon F3HP and FM2N and lenses will keep on giving me some of the best tools for making photographs that a film-loving nut like me will need.  The 85mm f1.8 Nikkor AF-D lens is another one that I had wanted for a long time, as it is great for portraits on film and digital.  The F3HP's high-eyepoint viewfinder is wonderful for a glasses-wearer like me, and the difference between that and any DSLR finder and most film SLRs is simply something to be experienced.My best tribute to Bill will be continuing to keep on photographing, and to help others out by mentoring, when possible.  It's the gift that keeps on giving."},
{"title": "A baby Holga!", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2009", "text": "Back in March, I found an ebay seller in Hong Kong that was advertising the Holga 135BC  at about $18 + the same for shipping.  At first I thought the shipping was too excessive, but then realized it was still cheaper than buying the camera from any US vendor (and not including shipping)!  So, I did a \"buy it now\" and a few weeks later, the camera arrived from China.The Holga 135BC takes 35mm film and has a build very similar to the latest model Holgas that use 120 film.  A 47mm glass lens with an f/8 aperture, B+N shutter, and focus from about 4 feet to infinity. There is a spot for a screw-in cable release on the shutter button and a tripod socket.  The \"BC\" means \"bent corners\" or vignetting on the corners, which is achieved by a cutout behind the lens with a dot-pattern to cause the slight vignette.  I like the feature of being able to do multiple exposures without advancing the film, and the B setting is pretty handy.I like the way the camera feels in my hand, and though I only have one roll of film through it, I like what I see so far.  I shot with it at an overcast day at Festifools in downtown Ann Arbor on April 5, and finished the roll at the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club meeting at the Corner Brewery in Ypsilanti on April 7.  For those, I used a Vivitar flash.  Festifools:It was pretty overcast for 100 speed film that day, so I would recommend 400 if shooting in dreary weather. One shot from the A3C3 Meeting:Right now I have a roll of Plus-X Pan in it, and will probably load it with some Eastman 5222 (250 ISO) after that.  The camera doesn't feel cheap like those plastic Vivitar cameras, and if the US vendors could get these on the market for $25 each, they would sell a ton of them."},

Last month, several of us Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club members thought up assignments that people could choose to do before the April meeting.  One assignment was to photograph shoes or footwear in an unusual setting, and unattached to the feet.  I came up with an alternative assignment which is a bit different.  Take a photograph. Now, close your eyes and turn about 360 degrees, put the camera to your eye, and keeping them closed, take a photo.  Now open your eyes and see where you are and where the camera is pointed.  It's not really blind photography, because we are using our sense of place to take the next shot.  Of course, it's amusing to see how far off we can be.  Does the sightless shot differ appreciably from the first one?  Is it better or worse?  How close to the original pose were you?   Using my crappy Vivitar PN400 plastic camera (which is wide-angle), I took a series of photos, some of which are shown below.    You decide which is better -- the first image with eyes open or the second one with eyes closed.

{"title": "Kodak's New Product Announcement", "date": "Wednesday, April 01, 2009", "text": "Kodak to Reissue the Brownie CameraRochester, NY -- The camera that spurred on the amateur photography boom at the turn of the last century, and turned Eastman Kodak into an iconic symbol of prosperity and photographic prowess, is back.   Yes, the Kodak Brownie.  It assumed various forms after the initial wood and cardboard box camera, but the premise of simplicity and \"You take the picture, we do the rest\" remained, no matter what form the camera took.  From the box brownies to the Pocket Instamatic, the Brownie camera became a symbol of simple, yet adequate snapshot cameras.\"We realized that the Holga and Diana cameras now being sold as film cameras of choice for the hip, young arty photographers are introducing a new generation to shooting film.\" said Lou Wratten of the Consumer Products division of Kodak. \"Despite the popularity of the Holga and Diana cameras, they really are nothing more than cheap Chinese-made pieces of plastic with no more complexity than most Brownie cameras that were made by Kodak. We feel that rather than the Brownie being a symbol of Kodak's past, it should be reintroduced to a new generation that grew up on digital cameras and want something more from photography.\" Kodak has not manufactured cameras in the US for nearly 25 years, but given the current economy, a small plant in Rochester, NY will be able to operate at a profit manufacturing the new Brownie camera.  Sources within the company indicate that the Brownie will use 120 roll-film, just as the Holga and Diana cameras currently do.  The camera will utilize a single meniscus lens for that sweet optical character that was typical of the early Brownie cameras. Unlike the earlier Brownies, the camera will not be made of wood and paper, but will be high-quality injection-molded plastic, and look very much like the box-like Brownie cameras made 100 years ago, except that they will be available in a variety of color schemes that will complement the hip fashions of today.  A basic all-black version should be popular with older users wanting to rekindle their love for simpler days with a camera. An advertising blitz will be aimed at younger users and Kodak expects to offer something that the Lomo and Holga people do not have, and that is a processing service. According to Wratten, \"We have heard from current Holga and Diana users that are frustrated by the lack of color film processing labs and the lack of support from the Lomographic Society once they have purchased a Diana or Holga.  Kodak has the infrastructure and experience to offer a mail-in processing service that will not only develop and print the images made from these simple cameras, but will furnish online scans from the negatives that users can then upload to photo-sharing sites such as the very popular Flickr.\"Sources at Kodak indicate that the new Brownie, with a manual, 2 rolls of the new Ektar 100 film, two processing mailers, and a presentation box with a Brownie time-line imprinted on the outside, will retail in time for the holiday season at a price of between $59 and $89.

{"title": "Super Macro for less than $100.", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2009", "text": "I've been doing macrophotography for quite a while.  From 35mm to medium format, and in between, digital.  The beauty of macro is that one can photograph almost anything and make it look interesting.  The downside of macro is that for most people, it means more money for adapters, lenses, cameras, etc.  I won't deny that I have some expensive macro equipment.  My Nikon 70-180 Micro-Nikkor is a lens that Nikon doesn't offer anymore, and you can't find one used.  I have used it for years and love the results. However, I am not telling you to go and buy the latest macro gear for your DSLR. Instead, we are doing this on the cheap.I recently bought a factory-refurbished Fuji Finepix S700 online from eCost.com for about $90.  I used to own a Fuji S7000 EVF camera and loved it.  When I bought a Nikon D70s, I sold the Fuji.   I'd been keeping my eye on the S700 for a while, because it is compact, and best of all, besides the 10x optical zoom,  the 46mm filter ring in front of the lens offers a way add filters and adapters.  That is something that the retractable lens P&S cameras do not have, and after I opened up the S700 box, I knew my Canon Powershot  A570 was going to Adrienne.So, how does one get super macro from the S700? First  of all, most P&S cameras that have a \"Macro\" feature are not really shooting macro.  They are allowing you to focus very closely at the shortest possible focal length.  That's a trick of wide-angle lenses being able to close-focus.  True macro is defined as being able to achieve a 1:1 reproduction ratio.  If the object is 5mm long, then the resulting image on the sensor (or film) is the same size.   Now, with the small sensors of point and shoot cameras, that's obviously an issue.So, how do you get true macro from the S700?  Simple.  First, you need a 46mm to 52mm step-up ring.  That allows you to use any 52mm diameter filter on the front of the S700.  Very useful if you want to do fun things.Second, you buy a 52mm reversing ring -- really just an adapter with male threads on both sides.Third, you screw any 50mm (called a normal lens) manual focus lens on the front of the S700 using the reversing ring (if it has a different diameter than 52mm, find an appropriate adapter).Here is the S700, the 46-52mm adapter, the reversing ring, and a Vivitar 50mm 1.7 lens.Set the S700 to maximum optical zoom, and make sure that the 50mm lens is set to its widest aperture (fully open).  Do not use the \"macro\" setting on the camera.  Be prepared to go wow.A yellowjacket at full magnification.If you use a macro setup like this one, which utilizes a steady base and good lighting, you'll get much better results.  Be careful of that exposed rear element of the 50mm lens.what the camera saw....If you reduce the zoom, you will get some vignetting from the attached 50mm, but you'll also get crisper results.At maximum magnification, the field of view is about 5mm wide!  You can go crazy with exploring  the tiny world in your backyard.These are the fruiting bodies of lichen in my backyard.  The beauty of this outfit is the compactness and versatility that you get from the S700, and the inexpensive nature of the gear that gives you some pretty good results."},
{"title": "The Internet Is Not My Newspaper", "date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2009", "text": "Yesterday, the local online sources were announcing that the Ann Arbor News will fold in July.  Today's news confirmed it.  It's a sad commentary that a city the size of Ann Arbor cannot support a daily newspaper.  I know that things have been tough on newspapers all over the country.  But I wonder is it truly symptomatic of declining advertising revenues because of the web that some papers are going under, or is it the result of larger syndicates and big corporations that have only the shareholder's interest, and not that of the people that they serve?  Just as with Pfizer, that pulled up stakes and left Ann Arbor (after pumping millions into new facilities here)-- Ann Arbor was a dot on the map.  The head offices had no more affinity to this town than anywhere else.  So, my question is this:  Has globalization and a faceless corporate bureaucracy spelled doom for our country?  When companies are no longer part of the community -- whether its the banks that have your mortgage, the owners of your newspaper, or the company that bought out your local big employer -- are they sensitive to local problems, and being so large, are they incapable of actions that might actually be beneficial?  Smaller companies can often be more innovative, more adaptable to localized conditions.  On top of all that... what about the photographers, the writers, etc., that make a difference by being the people that make journalism one of the aspects of our democratic society.  A blogger can do only so much.  But the power of the printed page has made a huge difference in our society. A free and independent press is essential for public discourse and communication to all levels of society.  Depending on getting your news off the web is not the same.  It shuts out more people than the pundits want to admit.  Surely, Ann Arbor can support a daily paper, if it were locally-owned.  Perhaps even a weekly edition, or whatever the Ann arbor News morphs into.  Maybe some group just needs to restart the Ann Arbor Argus and give it a go.  Maybe I'm just an idealistic idiot, but Washtenaw County needs to be served by a paper.  We are not, and never will be covered by the Free Press or the Detroit News unless it's UM sports or some tragedy befalls someone.Don't get me wrong -- I'm not against news on the web.  It's a good adjunct to a paper.  It's not, and never will be a replacement for the tactile and easily scanned newspaper.  Besides, I can't light a fire in the fireplace with my laptop."},
{"title": "Fairyland At Matthaei Botanical Gardens", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2009", "text": "Yesterday, I visited the Conservatory at Matthaei Botanical Gardens to photograph the garden fairies that my wife, Adrienne had been telling me about.  She's one of the horticulturists at MBG, and has worked there since 1983.  So, you might think that I go there all the time to take photographs, but in fact, I don't go there enough. For those that rarely go there, or haven't been there yet, the conservatory is a good dose of what one needs as we emerge from the lingering grip of winter.  Yes, spring is technically here, but until the last vestiges of those piles of snow that remind me of decaying whale carcasses disappear, we are fortunate to have Matthaei's conservatory to buoy us.  Matthaei's \"Enchanted Spring Display\" is very charming, with small fairies placed in the plantings amongst the spring flowers that are now blooming the conservatory.  The fairies look like they are right out of the Art Nouveau period, and are obviously a big hit with children of the age that can still imagine fairies as something that might exist.  In addition, there are placards with fairies for different plants, such as the \"Lobsterclaw Fairy\" for the Heliconia flowers.  I like the idea of garden fairies... and there is that part of our psyche that seems to want to believe in the supernatural. Fairies are certainly some of the less horrific things that one could believe in, and if you want to create your own fairy garden, one source that seems to have it all is the aptly-named Garden Fairy.com.I spent over an hour in the conservatory, photographing the diminutive fairies and the flowers with my Nikon F3 with my Lensbaby lens, as well as a lot of shots taken with my Fuji Finepix S700 with some different filters on the front to achieve the look I wanted.  The S700 was great for reaching in over the plants to get close-up shots, and of course, to get the immediate results that you see here.  I'll be interested in seeing how the F3 shots came out, as I was using Kodak's Ektar 100 color film.   Despite being an adult, I was having fun trying to find the various fairies amongst the flowers, and I saw small children there that were having even more fun than I was.    The display will be up until March 31, so give yourself a respite from the weather, and see the flowering bulbs and the fairies at UM's Matthaei Botanical Gardens on Dixboro Road."},

My camera came directly from Russia. About six years ago, a colleague at work went to St. Petersburg for a few weeks, and I gave him a $20 bill and a photo of a Fed 5, and asked him to buy one if he saw some for sale.  Sure enough, he did, and the camera is in pretty decent condition and works properly.  I haven't used it as much I probably should, and last summer I loaned it to my buddy Marc Akemann to shoot with. he recently returned it after finishing a roll of Kodachrome 64.  His wonderful photos inspired me to use the camera again.  The Fed 5 has a pretty nice rangefinder, and the eyepiece has an adjustable diopter control, which I find very useful.  Mechanically, the camera works well -- not as smooth as a Leica, but not bad.  The cloth focal-plane shutter goes from B- 1/500 sec, and the selenium light meter on my camera works, though I have never used it.  The only  thing the camera lacks are strap lugs!

{"title": "On Reading Andre Kertesz", "date": "Sunday, March 08, 2009", "text": "Yesterday, Adrienne, Marc Akemann, Stefan Peterson and I ventured over to the Grand Rapids Art Museum to view the exhibit - Andre Kertesz: On Reading.  There were over 75 photographs spanning 50 years from 1925 to 1975, all related to the subject of reading.  Many were focused on the act of reading, from Paris to New York, and Japan. Others presented the universality of the importance of books and newspapers in our lives. While presented as a photo-essay of a sort, and even though the images represented 50 years of work, I can't really say that I was enthralled or enlightened by the exhibit.  There were perhaps a handful of images that I really liked and thought were exemplary images.  I was amazed that the prints were never spotted -- and in fact, some had very distinct dust spots and defects that had they been in a Weston photograph, would have elicited horror from anyone.   Perhaps, as a body of work from someone as prolific as Kartesz, it might be forgiven.  I certainly feel that the images presented in the tiny book, Andre Kartesz - The Early Years are of a superior quality.   I get what the photographer was trying to do, and photographing someone in the act of reading is almost like photographing something intimate. In fact, several of his photographs are voyeuristic in composition. Others were simply street photography, and less intrusive.  There is no question that Kartesz predates people such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Gary Winogrand, and Robert Frank.  Perhaps for that reason alone, his work is held in such regard, and there is justification for that.  Reading is a mostly individual activity, and there were several images that brought home to me why the PRINTED page (as opposed to the digital image) is important.  One can take a book anywhere - no batteries, no other technology is required to support the act of reading it, save for a light -- but even then, one can read in the daylight.  Once printed, the book remains there for reading, unchanged and an absolutely real thing with solidity, even if the thoughts contained within may be vacuous or weigh heavily on the reader.  I'm sure Kartesz didn't anticipate today's digital world.  However, he obviously did know something about how people respond to the printed page, and how the direct contact with those pages affects us, and influences our society.  Perhaps that is the final lesson one can take from On Reading.Added -- 03/23 -- I just found out about a new book that contains nothing but SX-70 Polaroid shots by Kartesz, now available on Amazon.com.  From this link, it looks like a book that I'd like to own."},
{"title": "The Vivitar 35EE", "date": "Saturday, February 28, 2009", "text": "If it were a shoe size, 35 EE would be gynormous.  Thankfully, we are talking about a 35mm rangefinder camera.  Vivitar (actually a US company, once called Ponder and Best) is known primarily for inexpensive cameras these days, and there are a lot of plastic cameras out there with that name on them.  At one time, the Vivitar Series 1 SLR lenses were top-notch glass (manufactured by Kiron).  So, as a bit of background, Vivitar's offerings are all made by other companies in Asia, and they don't have any manufacturing facilities of their own. The Vivitar 35EE is a solid, metal-bodied 35mm RF camera with autoexposure mode only.  The 38mm f2.8 lens is very good (made by Cosina?), and the rangefinder is easy to see in the viewfinder.  The camera pictured here belongs to my daughter Marjorie, away at NMU in Marquette.    I thought I'd use it for a roll of film just so it wouldn't be lonely.  It is the first camera that she purchased at a camera show -- back when she was in middle school.   It runs best with a mercury cell, which it has in there now.   The camera's ASA dial goes from 25 to 400, which eliminates the use of faster film.  However, with 200 ISO film (I used Kodak Gold 200), I found that the camera gave very good results.   This late 1970s camera appears to be quite durable, and it is a very attractive, small RF camera.  The only knock would be the inability to manually control the shutter or aperture, as the camera is auto-exposure only.  The 46mm thread allows the use of filters, which is a nice feature.    The camera is fun to use, and ought to be a keeper should you find one somewhere."},
{"title": "Goodbye to a fellow photographer", "date": "Wednesday, February 25, 2009", "text": "David J. Bay, a colleague at the University of Michigan passed away on Feb. 21 after a lengthy illness.  I had known David for nearly my entire career at UM (28 years), and he'd been working for the University for over 34 years.  I always envied Dave's position -- after all, not all that many photographers end up with a full-time job with benefits.  Dave was a laid-back person that really knew his craft, and I enjoyed his wry sense of humor. I can't say that we were close friends -- in fact, most of his personal life was a mystery to me.  I used to see him at the bar at Ashley's pub every now and then, and he often drove around in a  black Harley with a side-car, and looked every bit the part of someone that enjoyed being himself.  Dave was an excellent photographer, and whether he was shooting a staff portrait, some butterflies in a tray, or making slides for talks, his work was always well-done.  I doubt that many faculty realized the \"I need it by tomorrow\" approach to getting slides done for a talk that should have been done weeks before was a sure way make Dave lose his hair. I used to talk to him whenever I was in his building, and whenever we ran into each other somewhere, we would discuss photography.  He loved Nikons and we shared a common interest in the craft of being a good photographer.  I know he liked sharing his expertise, and I imagine there are scores of graduate students that learned a thing or two from Dave.  With anyone so well-versed in photography, he made the difficult appear simple, his techniques refined from years of experience.  The digital tide came his way, and he adapted, though I suspect somewhat grudgingly.  Because as we all know, anyone with a digital camera instantly thinks they are now an expert on photography.  I'm sure Dave had some interesting exchanges with such people.

The artist in the Museum of Anthropology stopped by my office last week to let me know that their darkroom was being decommissioned and that I should stop by.  I never used that particular darkroom, but it has a very personal history for me.   You see, the person I bought my house from (Bill Brudon) was the Museum Artist and used that darkroom for a number of years (until he left in 1960 or so), and it held a special place in his heart. The darkroom went from the Museum of Zoology to Anthropology about 16 years ago, and the enlarger that used to be there (an Omega D2) was the one that Bill used.  That enlarger eventually found its way to my house a few years ago, and I gave it to a friend that wanted to set up his own darkroom.   Bill retired from the University long ago, and is not in good health right now.  That darkroom has been through a few iterations, and looks only vaguely the way I remember it when it belonged to the Museum of Zoology.  The walls used to be all black, and there was lots of old maple cabinetry -- which still exists on the walls of one side.   Given that the workflow at the museum is strictly digital now, of course, it's time for it to go. Thankfully, I have my own fully stocked darkroom, but it still makes me sad to see another one disappear."},
{"title": "High-def with a 35mm camera", "date": "Sunday, February 15, 2009", "text": "Last night I finally processed a roll of TechPan film that I had recently shot with my Zeiss-Ikon Contina.  I started the roll probably on 2007, and finished it up a few weeks ago, photographing the ice and snow at Barton Dam.  A cold day, and perfect for a camera like the Contina, since it's easy to adjust and use.    I'd shot several rolls of film in the camera before with great result.The Contina has a 45mm 2.8 lens that is quite sharp and contrasty.  It has a lens hood that I usually forget to attach, and probably should use more than I do.  However, it's a nice example of a good zone-focus camera.After I developed the TechPan, my worst fears were realized.  While shooting at Barton Dam, I thought that the film advance seemed a bit odd. Yes, the film was advancing, but perhaps it was the fact that my hands were cold and that I hadn't used the camera in a while that I was imagining things.  After I hung the film up to dry, I saw that the first few exposures made at West Park --probably in 2007 -- were ok, but the frame spacing was a tad off.  Then, the next 20+ shots at Barton Dam were overlapped continually until the last 11 frames.  Ugh.  There are (I mean, were) some great shots in there.  The last 11 were spaced pretty much ok. That was pretty disapponting, as I knew that I had some good exposures at the dam.  The ones that were okay, were probably not my best compositions on the roll, but they are the ones that survived.  West Park Willows in 2007(?)Now, for Barton Dam:TechPan (discontinued several years ago by Kodak) continues to be a film that amazes me.  I have PLENTY of it, and though I don't shoot it as often as I should, it points out how much fun using film can be.  So long as I have the developers (Technidol or Photographer's Formulary TD-3) and the film, it'll give me more years of high-definition 35mm photography.  Imagine using this film in a Hasselblad X-Pan!   Virtually grainless, and the tonality, tamed with a proper developer, is very good, as you can see in the above images."},
{"title": "The Argus 75 - A toy or a tool?", "date": "Friday, January 30, 2009", "text": "The Argus 75 is a fun little bakelite wonder from Ann Arbor-based Argus.  Produced from about 1949-1964, the camera takes 620 film.  It has a shutter-cocking feature that prevents double exposures -- which was useful if you were one of those families that had at least two Christmases, Halloweens, or whatever on one roll of film (12 exposures).  The Argus 75 (which started out named as the Argoflex 75) was the very first Argus that I bought in an antique shop in Cheboygan, MI about 8 or 9 years ago.  I then started acquiring other Argus cameras, and as they say, \"The rest is history.\"  The cameras isn't a real TLR in the sense that it's really a box camera with a reflex viewing window that uses a second lens.  There is nothing to adjust except for Instant and Time, for making your exposures.  The Time is important, if you wish to shoot in dim light, or convert the camera to a pinhole.    A very useful feature is that Argus put a tripod thread on the bottom of the camera, making it more versatile.  It's hard hand-holding a camera for time exposures.The 75mm lens is coated, and the aperture is about f/13.  \"Instant\" shutter speed is about 1/60 sec.  Back in the day, Kodak's Verichrome Pan was the ideal film for this camera.  Today, you could use Ilford FP4+, Kodak Plus-X Pan, or Fuji Across 100 for sunny to cloudy-bright conditions.  For color -- Fuji Superia 100 works well.    Since it was designed for 620 film, you can put a 620 spool in the take-up reel, and a trimmed 120 spool on the supply side.  If that's too tight, you may have to respool your 120 film onto a 620 spool. I once offered to write an article on the Argus 75 for Lightleaks magazine, but the editor told me it wasn't a \"toy camera.\"  It's just as much of a toy as the Kodak Brownie Hawkeye, or the Agfa Clack.  To be sure, a well-made box camera, but really, nothing to adjust except for the shutter between Instant and Time. So, in that sense, it's just as much a toy camera as the Holga...maybe more so.Since this camera has a tripod socket, it is easy to set it somewhere low and use the time exposure to good effect:The camera typically  has everything in focus from about 7.5 feet to infinity.  If you can find the Argus \"portrait filter\" (a close-up lens), you can shoot things that are about 3 feet away (or experiment with other close-up lenses):There are a number of variations on the Argus 75 -- and rather than repeat what is already out there on the web, go on over to James Surprenant's website.   I often get asked how much these cameras are worth.  Not really much.  Don't pay more than $10 for one in great condition with the leather case and flash holder.  The average value is probably closer to $5.  Argus made a lot of these, and if you get a good one (most are in working condition, but you will need to turn the film winding knob to cock the shutter - look for the red to appear behind the lens) - give it a try with some film.My pal, Gene McSweeny takes great photos with vintage cameras, so check out his Argus 75. A gallery of all the Argoflex cameras can be found here.So, is it a toy or a tool?  Both."},
{"title": "A Lesser-known Agfa - The Solina", "date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2009", "text": "I do like trying out old cameras.  Sometimes I am disappointed in the results, other times surprised.  In today's digital world, most of the cameras operate so similarly that one can pick up a Nikon or a Canon or an Olympus  and begin using it without too much thought.  Not so, back in the days of vintage cameras.  Some designs (like the Kodak Retinas) had the film advance lever on the bottom, or on the left (Exakta), or perhaps it was a knob to wind the film (many designs) instead of a ratcheting lever. Some cameras have rangefinder focusing, others scale focusing.  The variations on a pretty basic set of features is amazing, and perhaps that is why so many people like collecting old cameras.The Agfa Solina pictured above, was made from 1960-62, and features a 45mmm Agfa Color Apotar lens (I'm thinking 3 elements), witha maximum aperture of f3.5.  Shutter speeds range from B-1/200, and it has scale focusing.  According to McKeown's it was distributed in the USA by Montgomery Ward. Current value is from $25-$40.Okay, enough of the the geeky stuff -- how does the camera perform?  Well, I have shot 2 rolls of film in the camera, and it reminds me a bit of the Kodak Retinette with similar features.  The only knock on the camera might be the scale focus, since that's always a problem between 3 feet an 20 feet at wide-open apertures.  Otherwise, it is a lightweight camera with a nice clear viewfinder and is simple to operate.    Here are a few recent photos: ."},
{"title": "Winter Photography With A Hammer", "date": "Sunday, January 18, 2009", "text": "Well, perhaps not really a hammer, but there is no doubt that the Nikon F2 could be used for one if necessary.  Like a hammer, it is a basic tool - what you create with it depends on the wielder. My F2 pictured above, has a plain (non-metered DE-1) prism, making for a very solid and attractive SLR.  Winter photography (and by that, I mean with snow being present) is challenging enough -- too cold and your batteries in the fancy SLR or DSLR fail, leaving you with a plastic  rock, never mind the fact that your hands get cold adjusting all those tiny buttons.   No, I think winter photography works really well for simple cameras with no batteries, or if any -- just the ones needed for the meter.   The Nikon F2 with a plain prism obviously has no metering, so you can use a hand-held meter, or learn to trust your instincts and go with the \"sunny-16\" rules.  I like b&w film for snowy landscapes -- I find that unless there is a compelling color element, b&w and shades of gray are the predominant colors, anyway.    So, I tend to shoot b&w film, and in the photos that follow, it was a roll of expired Kodak Plus-X Pan.  Kodak's T-Max 100 or Tri-X are also good choices.A lens hood is a good idea, as there are reflections coming off snow in the winter landscape that can cause havoc with lens flare and reducing contrast.    If you shoot using sunny-16, you won't have to account for the meter being wrong, as the snow will reflect enough light that your meter will indicate overexposure.  If your camera has exposure compensation, set it at +1 to +2, depending on conditions to get an accurate exposure.  Bracket, if necessary.  Black and white film has plenty of latitude, and some overexposure is better than underexposure with most b&w emulsions.The Nikon F2 was the last hand-assembled camera made by Nikon, and was produced from 1970-1980.  Certainly one could not ask for a nicer all-mechanical body.  Without the big metering prism (typically a DP-1), it's fairly compact.  With winter shooting, I just go by sunny-16, and set the shutter speed and f-stops accordingly.  No tiny buttons or thumbwheels to adjust.  Manual focus, of course.    I also use a tripod in the snow, with a quick-release bracket.  That makes landscape photography much easier, keeps the camera steady, and another tip - it's easier to change lenses, since the camera is sitting on the sturdy tripod, and cold hands are less likely to be dropping things.One of my favorite places to shoot locally is at Matthaei Botanical Gardens -- the trails that follow Fleming Creek offer access to some nice winter scenes that are usually pretty undisturbed.The bridge over the pond that leads to the trails.  Tamron 90mm lens.The eye in the ice.I love the contrast of snow and water and the various states of ice formation.Try some winter photography -- go all-manual with a twin-lens reflex, a 35mm SLR or even a Holga.  Leave the DSLR at home."},

{"title": "The Ricoh Six - A Retro Photographic Tool", "date": "Thursday, January 01, 2009", "text": "It's rather fun starting the new year with a blog post.  I'm sitting here in my comfy chair, watching the Detroit Red Wings play the Chicago Blackhawks in a great outdoor game at Wrigley Field in Chicago-- on the 46\" HD TV.  So, since today's hockey game has retro sweaters and is outside, I'll discuss using a retro camera -- the Ricoh Six medium-format folder.Riken Optical Company (later renamed Ricoh) introduced the camera in 1952, and it seems to share optics and shutter assemblies with the Ricohflex TLRs from the same period.  The Ricoh Six comes with a removable mask that allows 6 x 4.5 cm negatives for 16 exposures per roll of 120 film, or 12 exposures without the mask at 6 x 6 cm.  The optical viewfinder has a yellow border so that you can see the rectangular format when shooting with the 6 x 4.5 mask.  Optically, the Ricoh Six sports an 80 mm \"Orinar\" lens with a f/3.5 maximum aperture, and a Riken shutter, which has speeds of B, 1/25, 1/50, and 1/100 sec shutter speeds.   The back of the camera has shuttered film windows for each negative format.   Using the camera is a breeze.  Depressing the front latch release button on the top deck extends the bed and the bellows clicks into place.  Focusing is by scale focusing, though with the cold shoe on top, one could add a rangefinder for accuracy.  The smallest aperture is f/22, and I find that there is some vignetting at f/16 and f/22 when shooting at 6x6.  You cock the shutter on the lens, but fire it with the release button on the top deck of the camera.  There is nothing  complex or extraordinary about the camera, but it is the only post-war folding camera that Ricoh produced.  Like the Ricohflex TLRs, the leatherette stiffens and flakes off with age.I bought my camera  for $40 about 7 years ago at an outdoor camera swap that was at Dave's Photo emporium.  I think I have seen one other example of this model since.   I find  the camera gives reasonably good results for an inexpensive folder.  Its bellows is sound, and all the features work as they should, which isn't bad for a 57-year old camera!The Wings won 6-4, by the way.  Here are ssome recent images in square format, followed by some taken a few years ago in 6x4.5 format.      Some shots with the 6 x 4.5 mask:Well, best wishes for all of us in 2009.

{"title": "A Christmas Bokeh Project", "date": "Friday, December 26, 2008", "text": "DIY Bokeh EffectsThe Christmas holidays are a great time for photographic fun with the lights on the Christmas tree, candles, and other holiday lighting displays.If, like me, you live in a northern climate where December nights are usually cold and snowy, indoor tree lighting is much preferred.  There are some tutorials available on the web that show you how to create overlays in front of the lens with cutouts that act as the aperture, and combined with a fast lens (large maximum aperture - i.e., f/2 to f1.4) you'll get the out of focus (OOF) highlights with the same shape as the cutouts. Popularly called bokeh, these OOF shapes are the same shape as the aperture -- usually circular in a good lens.  However, by using these cutouts in front of the lens, you'll get bokeh the same shape as the cutouts.Cokin Filter Holder and Gel-filter mount with cutout.My technique differs from the other ones online.  First of all, I decided to use a Cokin filter holder to place the cutouts in front of the lens, rather than cobbling something together with tape.  Use a gel filter-holder in the Cokin filter unit to fold the piece of black paper that we'll use.  Second, instead of cutting my own holes with an sharp hobby knife, I used punches easily found at craft stores.  For the snowflake, I used a 15mm wide snowflake punch that I bought at Michaels' for about $3.  Since these punches can only go so far from the edge of the paper, I found it was easier to cut a square into the larger piece of black paper and then tape the smaller piece of paper with the punched hole over the square, and then place that into the gel-filter adapter on the Cokin filter holder.  This is really pretty quick and easy, allowing you to  experiment with different shapes - either done freehand or with a punch.  Try different shapes!If you don't have a Cokin filter holder -- they are easily available online from B&H, Adorama, and Freestyle Photo (and ebay).   They are cheap, and allow you to also use a multitude of cool filters on your SLR (which are beyond the scope of this blog post for now).  The filters typically have a ring that you screw into the front of a lens -- 52, 55, 58 mm are typical sizes for filter rings.  Make sure you get the right size to fit your fast PRIME lens (not a zoom).  Your lens can be a 50mm focal length or 30, 45, 60 or 85mm, but the WIDEST aperture should be f/1.8.The color photo was made shooting wide-open and with the tree and lights completely out of focus.  That gave me the large snowflakes.  If you shoot a subject close-up with OOF highlights in the background, you'll get a nice effect.The key here is that the snowflake pattern acts as the aperture, and 15mm is a good choice for the aperture size.  Experiment with multiple shapes on the same piece of black paper, or repeated identical shapes, for different effects.  You'll need to focus manually here, because the AF won't be able to focus with the shaped cutouts in front of the lens.If you need to do this RIGHT NOW and can't wait for a Cokin holder, you can always use some gaffer's tape to hold the black paper mask in place in front of the lens.  Not as elegant, but it works.Happy Holidays!"},
{"title": "Local Book Review - Historic Photos of Ann Arbor!", "date": "Tuesday, December 23, 2008", "text": "A Review of Historic Photos of Ann ArborLast week, I received a book to review from Turner Publishing Co.  I'm a big fan of photographs  of known places from the past, and know that in many instances, what we see out there is just scratching the surface.  Any town that has an educated populace, a university, and  close proximity to a larger urban area, ought to have plenty of vintage photographs documenting its activities, people, disasters, parades, architecture, merchants, and civic organizations.  Often, we get to see a few dozen images at best, and the rest, we have to assume, are stashed away, filed, or forgotten somewhere. Since photography has existed for about 170 years, there have to be many thousands of images of large cities. As the technology of the medium improved and the number of photographers  grew,  one  would imagine that in some cases, we could have an almost  complete photographic record of some villages and towns from their inception to the present day. Obviously, the more one goes westward, the more likely that scenario is going to be. With my thoughts above in mind, I now review  Historic Photos of Ann Arbor with text and captions by Alice Goff and Megan Cooney by Turner Publishing Company.  Both authors are from the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan.  The Bentley is an amazing repository, and as the source of the photographs and information contained in this book, it's actually surprising to me that the book wasn't published by the University of Michigan Press.  It's also somewhat of a surprise that some prominent Ann Arbor historians were not involved in this book.  However, sometimes a fresh look needs to be taken by others, and in this instance, I think the authors did a splendid job assembling a variety of images of Ann Arbor from the 1860s to the 1960s.  One hundred years is a lot of time to cover, and thankfully, the majority of the photographs pre-date the 1950s.  Even though the University of Michigan is at the center of the growth of Ann Arbor, I appreciate that most of the photographs are peripheral to the University, and show more of the interface between town and gown.  I should also point out that I had not seen any of the photos  that appear in this book elsewhere (or at least I don't recall seeing).  That is probably due to the outstanding archives at the Bentley Library -- and an appreciated bonus is that each image in Historic Photos of Ann Arbor is cataloged in the Bentley Library with the data available at the end of the book.   I imagine the authors must have had some hard choices figuring out which photos to include in the book. No photographers are credited in the book, but I have to assume that such information is available from the Bentley Historical Library.  I know that in many such archives, photographers are often anonymous, unless the photographs came from the estate of a photographer.  During the late 1800s and early 1900s there were a number of portrait studios in the area, so I wonder who took the photographs. That's probably of very minor interest to most readers, as the photos are the real story. Anyone with an interest in the history of Ann Arbor will like this book, and the  breadth of the photographs really shows the history of the town. Many readers will appreciate the architecture that's long gone (and some still standing), as well as seeing how much has changed over the years.  Today, we talk about buying \"local,\" but as you will see in the photographs, local manufacturing and agriculture was a given state of affairs before 1940. Some may see the photos of long-extinct streetcars, and wonder, as we rethink our urban lifestyle, when such modes of transportation will be feasible once again.  I think that the authors did a reasonable balance with the captions -- enough information to put the images into context without going into too much interpretation.Back to my original train of thought -- this book fulfills much of the criteria of a photographic history, and no single book can contain everything, nor satisfy every varied interest.  I do believe that if you enjoy seeing your town \"back in the day,\" then you'll enjoy looking through the pages of Historic Photos of Ann Arbor.  Since the photographs are large, there is a lot of detail to look at, and you may find some recognizable surprises throughout.  The hardcover book is well-laid out, and at 205 pages, most of which are filled with photographs, is a deal at the price of $39.95.   This book is available at most area bookstores.Publishers Information:  Historic Photos of Ann Arbor. Text and captions by Alice Goff and Megan Cooney, 2007.

{"title": "Olympus XA Joy...", "date": "Friday, December 05, 2008", "text": "There are a lot of small 35mm cameras out there, but if I had to pick one that is a favorite, it would have to be the terrific little Olympus XA and its descendants.   For starters, it's a real rangefinder camera, has aperture-priority shooting, and its clamshell case protects the metal-bodied camera from the usual bumps and debris, and is easily carried in a pocket.  It runs on a silver-oxide battery, and has a wonderful 6-element 35mm f2.8 lens.  It's a more useable camera than my Rollei 35TE, and far more compact than the much later Olympus Stylus which is AF, requires a larger battery, and is noisy.  It's the most compact  35mm rangefinder camera that is capable of producing excellent quality images.  The one drawback might be that the flash is a separate unit, but the way I use this camera, I almost never need the flash.  It also comes with a tripod socket, so with a tiny tripod, you can use the camera on a table for long exposures.  It would be nice if the ISO setting would go as high as 1600, but 800 isn't too shabby.This photo from Erich Zechar exemplifies the beauty of this camera:I've had my XA for a number of years, and paid $50 for it -- with the original case and flash.    More recently, I acquired an Olympus XA-2.  The XA-2 isn't quite as full-featured as the XA (it has zone focusing), but it's still pretty good.    The fun thing with the XA is that because it is easily carried about, I often leave it in my messenger bag as the camera that's there when I need one.  As a result, it may take me months to go through a roll of film, and I have often forgotten all about what might be on a roll of film when I finally process it.    The upside of that, is that it's always a surprise when I get the film developed.  The downside is that I sometimes have to rack my brain about where I took the photos.I'm supposing the Vagina Monologues was in town.  Either that, or someone just really loves vagina,  But then, who doesn't?See what I mean?

I think I'll put b&w in next time, just to vary things a bit.There are a lot of resources on the web regarding the Olympus XA, and I'll point out my favorites:Flickr Olympus XA groupPhotoethnographyCameraquestUrban 75 reviewThe Classic Camera pageThe Olympus XA, XA2, and others are easily found on ebay, occasionally at thrift stores, and sometimes in a drawer somewhere.  They are compact 35mm cameras with  excellent Olympus optics and are a favorite of photographers that like having a dependable camera for those times when a full-featured and very obvious SLR just won't do.

{"title": "Kodak's Ektar 100 Film", "date": "Tuesday, November 25, 2008", "text": "For those people caliming that the \"sky is falling\" when it comes to the film industry, I'd like to point out that Kodak has introduced a new color (C-41) film.  Yes, Kodak -- the same company that seems to be bipolar at times - are they a digital or a film company?  They are a photographic company (which is what they need to stress), and it's nice to see them come out with a new film.  Kodak claims that it's the finest-grained color print film, very saturated, easily scanned, and sharp .  It's taken a while to get some -- it was introduced at Photokina in Europe, and has only very recently been available in the US.    I have been looking forward to trying some out, and I ordered 4 rolls from B&H (see link at bottom of the blog page).  I shot one roll last weekend  when I was on a trip to Grand Rapids with four other Crappy Camera Club members to see the Richard Avedon exhibit at the Grand Rapids Art Museum.  I used my Nikon N80 and a 24-120 Nikkor AF-D lens.Impressions -- First of all, Ektar 100 is a very fine-grained film that is purported to replace the UC-100 film (Ultra Color).  The ISO is 100, but I have seen online posts that indicate one might want to overexpose slightly (set meter to ISO 80).  Second, the film looks a lot more like results from Ektachrome .  Very sharp, contrasty, and saturated.   I took my roll to Ritz Camera yesterday for develop only and scan to CD.   After I opened up the images in Paint Shop Pro (the latest version is Ultimate X2), they seemed to be too contrasty, so I adjusted the curves, and after that, they all looked quite nice.  So, that may be just a matter of the Ritz scanner not yet being calibrated for this film.  However, the color saturation reminds me somewhat of results I have gotten from a LOMO camera.  Not necessarily a bad thing, IMHO.    The photos looked fine.  In fact, they really did remind me of slides that I have shot in the past.  Kodak acknowledges (on their web site) that Ektar 100 may replace E-6 films for users that like the look, but can only get C-41 processing where they live.  The film is also designed to be easier to scan, but I haven't tried scanning it myself as yet.  When I get some time this weekend, I may do that.   Overall, I like the film so far -- it's really so superior to the C-41 films that I typically shoot (Kodak Gold and Fuji Superia), that I may decide it's worth the extra cost for a \"pro\" C-41 film.    Right now I have another roll in my Olympus RC camera, with the ISO set at 80.  I look forward to seeing more results!Links to Ektar Information:Kodak's Q&A Kodak's Ektar 100 pageDiscussion on Photo.netAlso available at Freestyle!I'm encouraged that Kodak is producing new films and improving the technology.  Someone there knows that film still has a future."},

{"title": "One Subject, Many Possibilities", "date": "Tuesday, November 11, 2008", "text": "Those  people that know my style of photography are never surprised when I am on a photo shoot - road trip and find me trying to decide which camera(s) to bring along on that particular day.  We often hear the refrain \"the camera doesn't matter.\"  I beg to differ.  The camera matters a lot.  Whether I want to shoot with a toy camera, a Nikon SLR, film or digital, 35mm or 120 film, hell -- even a Polaroid, these are all choices that make the final image of any given subject a reflection of the camera and materials used to capture it.  Here is a case in point:Take one exotic vegetable that I have only seen previously on Flickr -- Broccoli Romanesque (actually a cauliflower), which I finally picked up at a local store.  Could I capture its interesting quality?  Apart from the obvious Fibonacci/Fractal connection, the broccoli head and the leaves surrounding it had great texture and possibilities for a still-life.  So, before we had the vegetable for dinner, I spent an evening photographing it with several different cameras set on a matte black backdrop and used one incandescent light for the light source.Shot with the Nikon D70s and the 60mm macro lens:Using the Polaroid SX-70 and 600 series film:Using my Canon Powershot, and shooting in manual b&w mode:and finally, shot with my Hasselblad 501C, 80mm lens, and a +3 diopter on Fortepan 200 film (probably shot at f5.6 here):Obviously, each camera helped me create different images.  I love the Polaroid image and the Hasselblad shot is very nice. So, I think this shows that the camera does make a difference, as does the person using it.  Maybe the next test is to take the same camera, same subject, same set, and let a few different photographers shoot.  Could be an interesting exercise!"},

In typical usage, one develops Kodalith in a high-contrast A/B lith developer for pure b&w  with no gray.  However, there are some tricks to allow its use as a pictorial (gray-tones) film.  I have used Diafine in the past, and got pretty decent results, but in this case I developed under red safelight by inspection in Dektol (1:8) for about 3.5 minutes.   1:10 might be even better, but I am happy with the stark look I got from these ruins of Quincy Mine.   I really like my results, and this is not something you can get digitally, boys and girls.   The raking light at the end of the day really made the shots stand out."},
{"title": "Think about it", "date": "Saturday, October 25, 2008", "text": "Think about it Originally uploaded by mfophotos.You have heard some pretty nasty things coming out of the mouths of McCain/Palin lately.  I keep hearing the word \"socialist\" applied to Obama's platform.  If redistributing the wealth means socialism, then, Palin is one, too.  Giving $$ from the oil companies to every Alaskan makes it a socialist state.   The US has one of the largest disparities in wealth right now, and the middle class, however you wish to define it, is being squeezed by so many factors.  I also hear that \"taxes are unpatriotic.\"  Excuse me, talking heads, but taxes pay for all the things that we take for granted.  Schools. Fire protection. Clean water. Infrastructure.  Don't want any of that?  Then I suggest that you move to somewhere like say, the Congo.Now, our country is faced with two wars, a serious financial crisis, job losses in many industries, unemployment for many, underemployment for many more, and so on.  When I saw this cornerstone at the firehouse in L'Anse, MI, it brought home all the things that our country accomplished at  the helm of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the \"new \"deal\" democrats.  1. Infrastructure -- how many of us have been to state parks, national parks, traveled over roads, bridges, used city services, drank clean water, enjoyed electricity?  That didn't appear overnight, and much of it was the result of WPA programs.    The Works Progress Administration built schools, firehouses, county courthouses, city halls, bridges, sidewalks, roads, dams, park facilities, hospitals, and more.  It put people to work and much of the infrastructure in rural areas still dates from the WPA.2. Social Security -- there was never any safety net for working class people unless they worked for some far-sighted company like Eastman Kodak.  Social Security changed all that.  The rich don't need it, and never did.So, what we need is to re-energize our country with a modern day version of the WPA.   That will only happen under an Obama/Biden administration.   Please vote putting your country first.  It's the only one we have."},
{"title": "A gem of a show - Accidental Mysteries at NMU", "date": "Tuesday, October 21, 2008", "text": "From Random Camera BlogLast weekend Adrienne and I drove up to Marquette to visit our daughter Marjorie,  now a junior in the Art & Design School at NMU.  We did a lot of driving around and a lot of photography, which I'll discuss in another post.  Marjorie told me about the new exhibit at the DeVos Art Museum at NMU, titled \"Accidental Mysteries.\"  It's one well-done show on \"vernacular photography.\"   Many of the images were very memorable, some quite equal to something we might expect from some famous photographers.  However, all of these were shot by unknown photographers from the past, when simple box and folding cameras produced the majority of images by the masses.  Some of the images have been digitally enlarged - to stunning effect.  The show write-up from NMU states:\"Accidental Mysteries, originally exhibited at the Sheldon Art Galleries in St. Louis, Missouri in 2005, is a unique collection of found photographs collected by John and Teenuh Foster. Over ninety images are on display in the exhibition, selected from a collection of hundreds, found over the years in flea markets, antique shops and auctions.\"For collectors of snapshots, the photos presented are real gems.  Many exhibited a degree of forethought that separates them from the run-of-the snapshot in an old family album.  Well-mounted and displayed, the images in the exhibit were a delight to pore over. I found myself laughing and sometimes amazed at some of the details in the photos that gave me an appreciation for the labor it took to choose the images for the exhibit.From Random Camera BlogVernacular photography is an interesting concept from the art world.  I'm not sure I can come up with a better term at the moment, but the exhibit, which runs until November 15 is worth seeing if you are going to be anywhere in the Upper Peninsula.  Northern Michigan University is a fine school, and the DeVos Art Museum is a gem for sure. The museum has featured a number of excellent exhibits, and though it may be small, the exhibits are wonderfully curated.

{"title": "The Infinite Landscape Exhibition", "date": "Wednesday, October 08, 2008", "text": "The University of Michigan's Museum of Art has been operating an off-site gallery (1301 South University, Ann Arbor ) dedicated to photography while the construction of the UMMA addition has closed down the museum.  For photography lovers, that has been a wonderful opportunity to see photography-only exhibits that have, for the most part, been well-executed.  The latest exhibit, \"The Infinite Landscape: Master Photographers from the UMMA Collection\" runs until January 4, 2009, but I would see it as soon as possible, and as many times as possible.  Landscape photography is a broad genre, and this exhibit definitely showcases some of its ardent practitioners - Ansel Adams, Paul Caponigro, Brett Weston, William Henry Jackson,  Eliot Porter, and Michael Kenna, to name just a few.   If one is an Ansel Adams fan, you'll be pleased with the 6 images of his that are shown (the Aspens is my favorite).  However, landscape photography IS infinite. Whether one photographs an intimate view of a pond (Nenuphars by Atget) or the enormity of the larger Yosemite Valley (Adams, William Henry Jackson, Carleton Watkins), the \"landscape\" can be almost anything.  I was pleased to see a Calotype from William Henry Fox Talbot - Loch Katrine, as well as an Orotone print from Edward S. Curtis of Canyon de Chelley (an Orotone is a print made on glass with gold pigment painted over the emulsion -- an interesting effect).  I don't know how big the UMMA photographic holdings are, but this show certainly has some breadth to it. Although I wasn't especially impressed with the Eliot Porter Cibachrome prints, or the Yellow Umbrella by John Butho, there are plenty of other photographers' works there I did enjoy.   I really liked the Two Barns by Minor White - fantastic use of raking light from a setting sun against, well, two barns.  Brett Weston's images engaged me, especially the untitled image of succulent plants.  Only one image from his father - China Cove, was in the exhibit, and perhaps it's only because the UMMA lacks other Edward Weston landscapes that they did not include more (yes, I'm an unabashed Edward Weston fan).  It's hard to say anything negative about Michael Kenna's work - his sublime landscape imagery is a wonderful counterpoint to the stark sharpness of Adams' Monolith in Yosemite.  I was also pleased to see some works by Kartesz, Josef Sudek, Karl Struss, Walker Evans, and Peter Henry Emerson.  Steichen's Balzac photogravure is perhaps one of the more famous images on display, though perhaps the weakest landscape.  There are, it seems, an infinite number of ways to portray a landscape, and although this exhibit runs for several months...it is not infinite, so I suggest that you go and pay a visit."},

This was a different type of show for us, as we are showing off our work in a store devoted to antiques and art made from \"found\" items.    Mary, the owner,  is enthusiastic over the show, and has incorporated a vintage photography motif to accompany the images.  I'm pleased with how the exhibit has come together.  This show is comprised of the work of only 4 of us, which I believe is a better way to showcase our work.  Having only  one or two images in a larger show with a dozen other photographers is definitely  less exposure for a photographer.  With more pieces on the wall  you can better connect with your viewers, and potential buyers, since you are offering them more choices.  I know, it's not really about the \"selling.\"  Riight.  Almost anyone that sells a photo will tell you that it's the best validation of your work.We have the reception this Friday,  October 3, from 7 - 9 pm.  Receptions are often when one makes the sales.  In this case, having the photos in a store for 3 weeks will undoubtedly be even better.  I'll be interested in seeing how people react to the photos by Bill Bresler, John Baird, Mike Myers and me.    Some people don't understand the Crappy Camera part, but once they view the images, I believe they leave their misconceptions behind, and see the art.  Despite the onslaught of digital imagery and the pervasiveness of Photoshop, people are often quite surprised at what we can do with relatively simple cameras.  In the end, the photograph speaks for itself."},

I'd estimate 60 people showed up, and many stayed for a long time to socialize, eat and drink, and view the show and the Argus Museum.   I was glad that Carol and Martha, Gene's daughters were there to be part of the reception, and I believe it was a feeling of closure for all of us, as the show was dedicated to their parents, Gene and George O'Neal.MiPHS also was one of the hosts for the reception, and a few MiPHS members attended -- I would have liked to have seen a few more there, but for a few, it was their first time at the Argus Museum.  I also think we may have gained a member or two in the process.I spent a lot of time talking to new visitors to the museum, and I think everyone really enjoyed our photographs.  There is a nice variety, and overall, it was a pretty easy show to put together. We had plenty of wine and food, and ran out of time before the refreshments ran out!Today, four of us were at the museum to be part of the Old West Side Home Tour.  The Argus Museum was part of the tour for the first time since the Argus building was reclaimed from UM and renovated in 1987.    187 people viewed the museum and the photo exhibit today, and it was a lot of fun talking to first-time visitors to the museum, most who never knew it was there, even though they lived closeby.  Lots of nice comments on the photography, and it was a pleasant way to spend a mostly rainy afternoon.The exhibit is up until October 12, and will be viewable 9 to 5 pm during the week.

I'm organizing this show, and it's been something that I have wanted to do for quite a while.  Having a show with contemporary images shot by vintage Argus cameras -- exhibited in the same building that once housed the factory the cameras were assembled in.  I doubt that has happened before in the USA.We don't have a huge space to show in, but we will feature about 10 photographers, with 1 or 2 images each.  The idea is to showcase our talent, and what one can still do with 50 year old Argus cameras (made right here in Ann Arbor, MI).  I hope the visitors enjoy the display.The second aspect of all this is that we are dedicating the show to the memory of Gene and George O'Neal -- two people that instigated the idea of the Argus Museum (where the show is held), and played a large part in the Michigan Photographic Historical Society.  Most A3C3 members never knew Gene, as she passed away in 2005.  George however, became a regular attendee and participant in our outings until just before his death last year.  The A3C3 wanted to also honor him with this show.  I think he would have been overjoyed with this.Well, off to work on the show materials, and hope that 2 more photographers come through with the images this weekend.

Ever since Big George's shut down their film lab, I have been shooting a lot less color with my medium-format cameras, whether Diana or Hasselblad.  It's a shame, because even though I do shoot a lot of monochrome images, there are times when color is the better option.  I put off developing a bunch of 120 film until last week, when I dropped off a bunch of rolls at Huron camera in Dexter.   Some of the rolls were pretty recent, and one camera had been working through a roll of color 620 -- my Kodak Medalist II.  It makes no sense that the camera with the fewest exposures would take the longest to finish up!  Anyhow, I am quite pleased with the expired Kodak GB200 that was on a 620 spool.

{"title": "Photo-Mythology", "date": "Sunday, July 20, 2008", "text": "I see all kinds of things passed around on the net as facts, whereas they are really opinions.  Sometimes there are such blatant misconceptions in photographic forums, that I wish I could throw an Argus brick (C-3) at the posters.   Some gems go like this:\"I need a pro camera so I can take better photos\"\"I want to sell my (insert camera system here) and get a ____ SLR, so I can take better photos\"\"Old lenses are not as good as the modern lenses\"\"I need to buy a Nikon D200 because I want to do portraits and weddings, and if I use my D40, people will think I'm not a pro\"\"I need to go and spend about a grand so that I have the lights, etc.  I need for portraits.\"and the list goes on... People looking to upgrade their equipment thinking that it will improve their photographs.  Of course, the camera companies would have you believe that this endless treadmill of upgrading WILL improve your photos.  All things being equal -- the Nikkormat bought in 1973 is as capable of taking great photos as the Nikon F6.  Of course, the newer cameras will have features that were unheard of back then.  The microcomputers running in these new cameras are fantastic -- you should never have a badly exposed image again.  However... hear me out.  Just because someone has the newest camera body and lenses, does not mean that their photos will be \"better.\"  Composition, subject matter, aesthetics, meaningfulness,  relevancy, artistry, colors, tonal values, etc., are issues that come from the photographer, not the camera.OK, to the heart of this  post --This  entry came about when I was looking through 5 rolls of processed black and white negatives on my light table, and had scanned some of them in already and viewed them on my monitor.  I wasn't in the least bit surprised that they came out so well, considering that I was using the following:A 30-something year old Nikon FE that I bought for less than $50 on ebay, and a 40+ year old Nikon 85mm f/1.8 Nikkor lens that I bought used in 2003.   The film was Agfa APX 100, developed in Rodinal, 1:25.What was I shooting?  Actually, it was whom I was shooting.  My friend Kelley posed for me in my backyard for a couple of hours and I think I came away with pretty nice images.   What myth did I dispel?  Well, for one, the Nikon FE is getting old, as SLRs go these days, and this one is kind of beat up outside.  It works well, though, and the metering is really accurate.  So, it is nowhere near a \"pro-looking\" camera.  The lens came from a sale at the UM Photoservices in 2003, as they were selling off a lot of older equipment in their transition to a digital workflow.  That 85mm 1.8 lens is a wonderful portrait lens, and I snapped it up.  You can see it has had so much studio use that the paint is worn off the barrel.    You will also notice I have the matching lens hood.  IMPORTANT.  A lens hood on that lens is a great idea.   Everyone should use lens hoods more often.  I was shooting outdoors, so I didn't need lighting -- just some reflectors.My shooting style for portraits is to crop in the viewfinder, so generally, my portraits fill the frame.  I also like using natural light, but will use lights when I need to.   Using the Nikon FE (it could be any manual focus Nikon, for that matter) with the 85mm lens is such a different experience than using my D70s.  For one, the image is brighter, larger, and easier for me to see. Two, it's just shutter speed and aperture and the meter.  No other things to worry about except posing and making sure all the elements you want are in the shot.So, let's see.  Can you tell if these were made with a \"pro\" or \"amateur\" camera?  Of course not.   If you have an image in a magazine, hanging on a wall, or in a book -- nobody will care what camera you used (if they are not some camera geek).     Neither will your client - if the images meet his/her expectations.  So, my advice is to shoot, shoot, shoot, and learn.  You can ask all you want about what lens to buy, and so on, but you have to use them!  You'll soon figure out what works for you.   At some point,  you will realize that your camera doesn't matter.  It's your eye and experience that provide better photos, not the newest wonder from Nikon,  Canon, or Pentax, etc.Oh, one last comment about the \"pro\" thing.  How you conduct yourself, how you deal with the assignment, and the results you deliver will have far more bearing on how people perceive you than what camera you have in your hand."},
{"title": "The Argus C-4 and a show in the works", "date": "Saturday, July 05, 2008", "text": "Of all the Argus cameras that I own, one particular model still gets used by me a few times a year -- the Argus C-4.  Despite the lack of removable lenses (not necessarily a deteriment, and the Geiss-modified C-4 did allow that), and a limited range of shutter speeds (only B, 1/10, 1/25, 1/50, 1/100 and 1/300) - the C-4 is a very usable camera, and looks quite elegant compared to the old workhorse, the Argus C-3. The camera pictured above is one that I bought about 8 years ago, and was one of my very first Argus camera purchases.  I have shot with it in quite a few places, and it is a pretty reliable camera.  Of course, I have more than one -- my other user C-4 was purchased a few years ago at an estate sale in Ann Arbor.  It was given to the owner by his wife as a Christmas gift, and she worked for Argus.  So, that makes that particular camera a little special in terms of history.   A few weeks ago, I packed the first camera for a trip to Munising, and then to Burt Lake and to Cross Village for Photostock 2008 (see previous post).  There was a roll of TechPan in it - at least that was what the label on the top of the camera indicated.  So, I finished off the roll of TechPan at AuTrain falls, figuring the slower speed film would allow me to get some better photos of blurred water.   Imagine my surprise when I developed the film the other night and saw negatives from the last time I shot with that camera --- Nebraska, 2003!  Argus #2 must have been getting most of the workouts in the past few years. From Carhenge, Alliance, Nebraska, July 2003.My other use for the camera was to reshoot the old lighthouse ruins at Cheboygan State Park. I shot it in 200o or 2001 with the C-4, and wondered if a few years more experience  might provide me with different images.  I'd like to think the second time was better, but the mosquitoes there were just fierce.  So, it was a battle to get the images I wanted.  This one is okay, but nothing special - blame the mosquitoes.RuinationMy best shots with the C-4 from the trip were at AuTrain Falls:The rest of the title for this post refers to the fact that the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club will be showing a series of images taken with Argus cameras, in memory of our friend George O'Neal, who passed away last August.  The title: Vintage Cameras - Contemporary Images.  The show will open in mid-September at the Argus Museum in Ann Arbor.  I will be posting more about it later."},
{"title": "Photostock  2008 - Fun Time in the Woods", "date": "Thursday, July 03, 2008", "text": "I had hoped to have had this posted a few days earlier, but I'd also hoped to have more of my film developed by now.  Last Wednesday, I was up north at Bill Schwab's place near Cross Village for Photostock 2008 -- a gathering of photographers, mostly all of which are members of the Analog Photography User's Group (APUG) on the web.  Bill has been offering some interesting wet-plate workshops, and his collodion workshop preceded the gathering.  I arrived for Photostock on the 25, and had a great time meeting a lot of photographers.  I only knew a couple previously, and a few I knew by their APUG names, but still, it took me the whole 4 days to associate names with most of the people -- as there were around 30 at any given day.  I camped out at Bill's woodlot, as did a few others, and it was pretty darn nice to wake up to the birds in the woods in the morning, make some coffee, and think about little but photography for several days. Marc Akemann and I teamed up for our excursions, and we got along really well - he's an excellent and very dedicated film shooter, and like me, shoots a lot of 35mm and some medium format.  Probably the worst combo would be a large format and a 35mm shooter, since our approaches are so different.  We had a great time going down to Sleeping bear Dunes on the Thursday and finding lots to occupy our time -- especially the ghost forest, which was the purpose of the trip.    Driving around and photographing anywhere in that part of Michigan virtually  guarantees that the trip will be lengthy, and we shot until after sunset. In the evenings, we viewed other photographers' portfolios, and it was a real eye-opener.  There are some really talented photographers out there and most of us don't see their work.  From 35mm to Cirkut cameras (a specialized panoramic camera), the quality of work was astounding.  It also made me realize that I need to get my ass in the darkroom and start printing.  A LOT. The relaxed atmosphere and sharing spirit of the Photostock was really refreshing, and getting out into the area and shooting so much film (over 20 rolls) was very rewarding.  I've just processed a few rolls already, and the shots from the Ghost Forest on TechPan look excellent and surreal.  I had a great time partnering with Marc, and made a new friend or two during those 4 days."},

I'm relaxing by sitting out on the deck and snapping photos of things in the garden, and then uploading them to flicker while sitting in the backyard.  It doesn't get much more fun than that.  In fact, I decided to shoot with an old favorite camera, the Nikon Coolpix 995 with a close-up lens on the front.  I had forgotten just how easy and good that could be...

{"title": "Cornell Capa Passes on", "date": "Saturday, May 24, 2008", "text": "The noted photojournalist Cornell Capa died at his home in Manhattan yesterday at the age of 90.  He had a long and influential career as a photojournalist.  His older brother, Robert Capa, perhaps a bigger \"name\" in the history of  photography, died in 1954 on assignment in Indochina.  In 1974, Cornell founded the International Center of Photography (ICP) in Manhattan as a center devoted to promoting and advancing the field of photojournalism.  His achievements as a photographer for Life magazine and his 30 years as a photojournalist can be summarized by a quote of his:“I am not an artist, and I never intended to be one,” he wrote in the 1992 book Cornell Capa: Photographs.  “I hope I have made some good photographs, but what I really hope is that I have done some good photo stories with memorable images that make a point, and, perhaps, even make a difference.”For more information,read the NY Times article.  The ICP has a short bio of Cornell Capa on their site.As a photographer,  I would be happy that one photograph of mine makes a difference to someone."},

I was shooting Plus-X with my Pentax ME -- not the best film for indoors, by any means.  But, I took this shot because I thought the 3 glasses looked interesting.  It wasn't until I saw the negative scan that I thought those three glasses also represented different outlooks on life -- you know the glass half-empty, etc.  So that's my title -- Three Views of Life."},
{"title": "Damn It's Still Winter in the Keweenaw!", "date": "Sunday, May 11, 2008", "text": "Or...how to bring a bunch of cameras, and only use one or two.On May 1, I drove up to Burt Lake so that I could leave early the next morning and help my daughter Marjorie move out of her dorm room at NMU in Marquette.  The drive to Burt Lake was uneventful, and I stayed  at my friend Joan's cottage for the evening.  Joan was there, and it was great talking with her about her recent trip to Alaska.   I left bright and early on the 2nd  – well not so bright – it was pretty gray and dull outside, not to mention somewhat wet.  I was over the Mackinac Bridge and on my way across the Upper Peninsula on US 2 after having a quick breakfast on the road.  It hadn't really struck me how much the season had regressed until I was in the UP – spring was definitely a good 3 weeks behind what we are having in Ann Arbor.    The maples were flowering  in Mackinac Co.,-- but nothing else. However, their bright red contrasted nicely against the green conifers.As I travelled across M-28 from Seney to Marquette, I started seeing an occasional remnant snowbank on the sheltered N-facing slopes.  I saw more as I passed Munising, and then then only an occasional debris-encrusted snowpile in Marquette. I arrived to a light rain in Marquette, and  I helped Marjorie get her Jeep loaded with stuff from her dorm room. By the time we left Marquette for the Keweenaw, it was around 2:30 pm., and we left her Jeep in the lot and drove the Echo.   As we drove along 41, the rain picked up, and as some point – about the time we stopped at Lake Michigamme – it began to really pour.  Lake Michigamme still had some ice on it, which surprised us.  By the time we arrived in Houghton, the rain had pretty much tapered off, and it was cool and windy, and we stopped at the Cyberian Cafe for coffee.  It started misting again as we left Houghton, and by the time we arrived in Calumet, it was sort of foggy and drizzling.  Ugh.  Perhaps the worst kind of weather for taking a out a camera.  I was wrong – it would get worse.  We managed to get the last room at a motel N of Calumet – where they had raised the rates because of it being MTU graduation weekend.  Oh well, it was clean, dry, and warm.  We had time to go and do some exploring after that, visiting Gay and Copper City – two little villages off aways from US 41.    Yes, it was raining, so we didn't shoot all that much.  We then headed back to Calumet and had dinner at the Michigan Inn – which has a beautiful bar and great food.May 3.  Fog.  Really pea-soupy type of fog.  I had to go find some breakfast and fill the car with gas.  Downtown Calumet looked like an eerie otherworld as the church spires dissolved into the fog at 7:30 in the morning.  It was misting out, too. I wish I had remembered to bring my raincoat and the umbrella.   We got on the road before 9 am and drove up 41 on the spine of the Keweenaw, and took the road to Lac LaBelle, which lies on the eastern side.  It's hard to realize that you are perched well above Lake Superior until you descend to Lac LaBelle.  The road slopes quite a bit, and we passed a ski resort on the way, until we arrived at the small village.  I'd love to see it on a nice day.  We did spot a loon, several common mergansers, and a hooded merganser in the lake.  I wonder if waterbirds like sunny days.  After Lac LaBelle, we followed the road to Bete Grise which lies right on the Lake Superior shore.  That was a beautiful place, even in the misty weather.  The trees in Bete Grise were mostly covered in thick hanging strands of lichen, resembling Spanish moss. We got back onto 41, and the mist and rain picked up as we went N, and so did the snow remaining alongside the road and in the woods. Mo and I were amazed at how much snow was still remaining on the 3 of May!  As we got closer to lake Medora, the snow looked to be several feet deep in a few places.  Then we saw Lake Medora, and it was still covered in ice.  Not a thin skim, mind you, but that thick white opaque ice that was probably quite thick.  Oh yeah, did I say it May 3?  Not in the Arctic, but the Keweenaw.   We managed a few shots there,  and were chilled by the wind and fine mist.  Finally, we got into Copper Harbor before noon, and drove around a bit, hitting Agate Beach where the Fanny Hooe River empties into Lake Superior.  I actually went back to the car and got out the Hasselblad and shot maybe a half-dozen images, until I could no longer feels my hands.  We went to the Pines restuarant and had coffee and a dinner-plate-sized cinnamon bun.  Sugar and starch is big there.  I found out that our waitress moved there with her family from Grand Rapids 5 years ago.  I asked her how she liked Copper Harbor.  She said, “It sucks.”  Nw I know why there are so many bars in the UPWe went back down the Keweenaw on the W side, on Route 26 towards Eagle Harbor. The coastline there is awesome, with rocks jutting out into Lake Superior where they are beaten by the waves.  We stopped at a few places slong the way, where I shot some images with my Canon A570 IS pocket digicamn and my Polaroid SX-70.  The weather was too crappy for any serious camera work.  It was an amazing scene, despite the inclement weather, and perhaps made all the more dynamic because of it.  We got some shots in Eagle Harbor where the lighthouse is located, and as we were leaving, it started to snow.  By the time we got into Calumet, the snow was sticking, and accumulating on cold surfaces. Not the May weather I had hoped for.  The Quincy Mine photos were out, so we went back to Houghton and then onto Marquette.  We stopped at the Father Baraga shrine near Baraga, and it is a rather weird place.  The statue of him looks like he's on a cloud supported by spider legs, while he wields a big crucifix and a pair of snowshoes.We got back to Marquette in mid-afternoon, Marjorie switched over to her Jeep, and then both vehicles continued on toward the cabin across the Mackinaw Bridge.  We had a fairly uneventful drive, and arrived at Burt Lake about 9:30. The drive on Sunday back home went pretty quickly, and we were rewarded with real spring as we drove farther south.  By the time we arrived in Ann Arbor, I felt like we were in Florida!"},
{"title": "The Way Back Machine", "date": "Friday, April 18, 2008", "text": "Remember Mr. Peabody's \"Way Back Machine\" in the Rocky and Bullwinkle shows?  Those entertaining little cartoons were a lot of fun -- and I still enjoy them.  The funny thing is, there is a \"way-back\" machine, and it's called a camera.   We can revisit the past -- though we can't really change it.  Little did people know how useful photographs taken nearly 100 years ago would be now.  In essence, these old photos are peeks into what once was -- and remains a powerful reason to photograph just about everything.  The reason I bring all this up is that I have been scanning and cataloging hundreds of old photographs and negatives that are housed in the Museum of Zoology Insect Division -- where I am the Collections Manager.  It so happens that naturalists were \"early adopters\" of photographic equipment, since they saw the camera as a record-keeping device.  With one photograph, one can see a lot of the habitat as it was where they stood at the time.Edward Bruce Williamson, a noted researcher on dragonflies (Odonata) made several trips to South America during 1918-1922.  We have many of his photographs (but not the negatives) from those early trips, and as I scanned and cataloged them, I wondered how things have changed since 1922.  Of course, the habitat shots are not terribly interesting to the general public, but he also captured some daily scenes as the group went along on their way to collect Odonata in these shots from Brazil, in 1922.    The papers of Williamson are now in the Bentley Historical Library, but his field notes and photographs from those trips are housed here at the UMMZ.  Eventually, they will be available over the internet.This image (EBW-010)was taken on the railroad in Matto Grosso, Brazil.  The car is a steam or gas-powered  unit made to travel the rails.  In the background is a lemon and banana plantation.  Most of these prints are small, and contact-printed from Vest-Pocket-sized negatives (127) or 120 film.This image (EBW-014)shows a little boy standing near a steam locomotive.  The caption basically tells us that he is a native-born Brazilian in Villa Murtinho, Matto Grosso, Brazil, whose parents are English-speaking Barbadoans, taken on Feb. 8, 1922.(EBW-046) - A \"River Steamer\" on the Rio Negro, Brazil, 1922.  These boats carried all sorts of supplies and people on a main thoroughfare - the Rio Negro.(EBW-058) - A church at Carvoeiro, Rio Negro, Brazil, taken from boat (I assume the River Steamer shown above) - note the high water to the rear of the church. (EBW-081) - Somewhere in Brazil, 1922.  \"Group of people with heavy man on Burro.\"  I have no other contextual information for this image!(EBW-124) - 1922, Brazil (?)  I believe one of the men on the horses is Jesse Williamson, a cousin of EBW.  Jess accompanied EBW on several expeditions to the neotropics.These are just a few samples of the images I've scanned in.  I think they are fascinating because they show a place as it was, not as viewed by Yanqui tourists (though I suppose, in a way, they were), but by astute naturalists spending their days in wetlands collecting Odonata for research on systematics -- the Indiana Joneses of Entomology, so to speak."},
{"title": "End of An Era", "date": "Thursday, April 10, 2008", "text": "I hate becoming an obituary writer.  Not for friends, but for businesses.  If you are one of the lucky people that still has a thriving camera store in your town, I am jealous.  After something like 40 years, Big George’s closed their photographic department in their new store last week.  The management line was that they lost the camera business to the office supply stores, the Wal-Marts, and the Meijers stores.  No, they lost the department when they decided that they would rather move fridges, stoves, and big TVs and not filters, in-store processing, and real photography gear.When I first started shopping for cameras and darkroom equipment at Big George’s in 2000, I was awe-struck by the photo department.  I could spend an hour just looking at things.  If I had a question, Lee Kitada or Mike Myers or another sales associate would answer with patience and good humor.  The moment I walked in the door, I was taken care of, whether I was buying a bottle of developer or looking to purchase something far more expensive.  In addition, they sold USED cameras and accessories, and took in trades.  My daughter was able to purchase a used Hasselblad outfit because of that.  One does not lose customers to that kind of service.  However, in the past 2 years, the photo department kept shrinking in the old store, with fewer items, and the management told them they could no longer sell used equipment.  It’s not like they had stuff piling up.  In fact, it was the ONLY place in town after Dave’s Photo Emporium closed, and Adray Camera closed its store later on.  It was the place to go if you are a pro or serious amateur, because if you needed an item that day, they might actually have it in stock.As the new management at Big George’s started planning for their new store, it was plain to see where things might be heading, and it wasn’t encouraging.  Before the move last year, they closed the mini-lab.  Big mistake, there.  That meant people that usually went there for film developing now had to go elsewhere, and they didn’t purchase something else while they were there.  When the new store opened last summer, the new photo department seemed like an afterthought, jammed into a corner with a fraction of what they used to carry.  Despite the best efforts of Mike and Lee to show that things would work out if they were listened to, the management felt otherwise and didn’t restock or reorder.  That alienates customers, so it all became a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the photo department was closed last week.  Not because people shopped online  or because of Wal-mart, but because the owners did not understand that market.  I’m not saying that digital cameras and the online shopping didn’t affect their sales, but  it has affected every camera store.A photo department in a bigger store CAN survive.  If they were worried about the length of time stock might sit on shelves, then I have to ask, why sell summer furniture and gas grills?  Second, they had a city the size of Ann Arbor with lots of student photographers, pros, amatuers, and people willing to spend money IN THE STORE, and basically told them they didn’t think they mattered.  Ultimately, people went elsewhere because they had to, not because they wanted to. Mike at the counter in the \"new\" Big George's July 2007.OK, I’m not in retail sales.  I don’t have an MBA, and I worked in a store only once in my life.  I can tell you though, that I know what constitutes good service, what inspires customer loyalty and what draws me into a store.  Someone commented to me that a photo store can’t make it anymore because of all the little things it has to  carry - perhaps, but then hobby shops and craft stores should be extinct, too.  I know there are constraints when one has to order products by the case to be able to order at all. There are issues with inventory, rent, etc., but a town the size of Ann Arbor ought to be able to support one full-service photographic store.  That store should have a mini-lab, a self-serve kiosk for digi-prints, film, used and new equipment, books, supplies, and the ability to do custom orders if necessary. In better days...just a few years ago.I will miss going to the photo department at Big George’s.  I will miss seeing Lee and chatting with him.  He really knows photography.  Mike, I will see pretty often, as he is a friend that I met there, and he’s a big part of my Crappy Camera experience.    As for the Big George’s store... I will not set foot into it again, for anything.If I won the lottery, I’d open a photographer’s co-op with a gallery, mini-lab, used sales, and a bookstore.  I’d also make people feel welcome and valued, just like Lee and Mike did. Mike at the old store, 2006."},
{"title": "Stanley, 1998-2008", "date": "Wednesday, March 26, 2008", "text": "My favorite cat, Stanley, died sometime today.  I last saw him this morning preening himself on our bed.  Adrienne discovered him there this evening looking all the world like he was sleeping.  He seemed so healthy, but I did know that he had a ticking bomb somewhere, as he'd had a few seizures over the years, and the vet had told us several years ago that he had a heart irregularity, but really, there was nothing that could be done about it.  I guess it finally caught up with him, but it seems like he went out without pain, and in a peaceful manner  -- which given all the possibilities, isn't so bad.  Still, we are quite upset, and Marjorie, away at NMU, is devastated.  Stanley was athletic, he loved to sit on my shoulder, talk to me, and he was always very lovable.  Just last night he was on the couch and was enjoying being rubbed and adored.  This morning I called his name and he came running, almost like a dog.  When our dog Mac (who died on June 2, 2007) was alive, Stanley would play games with him, such as jump over Mac when he ran past a doorway.  He also had a penchant for catching and dispatching chipmunks, and though we was a house cat, we would let him into the backyard along with Kosh and Phantom, the other two cats -- when we were home-- for a few hours at a time.  Stanley seemed to catch on and soon figured out the chipmunks.I will miss his goofy ways, such as him dragging a little stuffed toy sheep around  the house and meowing, talking to me when he wanted catnip, and his affection.  Truly, he was a unique cat that was a part  of our lives.  He will be remembered as a great feline companion."},
{"title": "Go Out In a Blaze of Glory", "date": "Friday, March 14, 2008", "text": "Sort of.  I saw that Staples had an online special on Polaroid 600 film, so I figured it was worth $120 to get 120 images from the two Polaroid SX-70s that I recently obtained.  There will never be another camera like that pioneering wonder from Land and his crew in 1972.  Once the Polaroid film is gone, that will be it, too, for those cameras.  I found out how to modify them to take the faster 600-series integral film, and luckily, I have a supply of neutral-density gels that I was able to cut up for placement in front of the lens.  Because of the 2x ND filter, the view is dimmer, but having a real SLR in my hands that shoots that film, and fits into a coat pocket is wonderful.  Makes those 600 series cameras look like the plastic pieces of junk that they are.So, I have been shooting with the 2 cameras, though I like the original manual-focus SX-70 the best.  I love the close-focusing, and the ability to have a blurred background.  I went for a short walk down S State Street in Ann Arbor  at noon today, and came away with a pocketful of photos:"},
{"title": "A Night at the Museum", "date": "Friday, March 07, 2008", "text": "For some time, I have wanted to get a bunch of the Crappy Camera people over to my workplace for a night of photography.  Most workplaces don't have a couple of mastodon skeletons, an Allosaurus, fossils of various kinds, dioramas, or mounted animals.  Yup, I work at a museum -- the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. However, the research museum is not as photogenic as the Exhibit Museum in the same building, which is where the Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club ended up on Tuesday evening.  Amy Harris, the director of the Exhibit Museum thought it sounded like a great idea, and we had pretty much free rein of the exhibits from 6:30 - 9 pm.  Twenty people braved a snowstorm to take advantage of the opportunity to bring whatever cameras they wanted, tripods, and in one case, a model.  I also encouraged the attendees to donate $5 each for the Exhibit Museum, and $110 was a big surprise the next day for the Director.The Ruthven Museum Building was completed in 1927, spurred by Alexander Grant Ruthven, the Director.  He later went on to become the President of UM, and the building that now bears his name houses the Exhibit Museum, and Museums of Anthropology, Paleontology, and Zoology.  It's the Exhibit Museum that people see, and is just generally known as the Natural History Museum.Anyhow, people quickly dispersed and wandered around, setting up equipment for their shots.  The array of cameras was great -- Polaroids, an Argus, Hasselblads, a Sinar view camera, digicams, Holgas, Dianas, pinhole cams, a Lubitel, and I'm sure a bunch of others that I never saw.    I spent quite a bit of time photographing the wonderful stairs.  Something I just can't do during the day, because of people using them.  The dioramas got quite a bit of attention as well.  They really are quite wonderful.  A museum such as ours may not be on par with the likes of the Smithsonian, American Museum of Natural History, or the Field Museum.  However, the exhibits are well-done, and for a university museum, is pretty outstanding.  After we had shot all we could, a few of us headed over to the Brown Jug for some beers and food, despite the snowstorm.  Others that had to drive some distance left right away, only to find a 25 minute commute turn into a 2 hr trip.Of course, afterwards, I thought of some things that I forgot to shoot, but hey, I can just stay after work and do that..."},

I'm home with some kind of nasty cold virus that has made me feel pretty crappy the past few days, and I spent a good deal of yesterday in Rochester, MI sitting at a table (along with my friend Cynthia) to appraise cameras and photos for the Rochester-Avon Historical Society's Appraisal Day -- not one person came in with something for us to look at.  So, as you can imagine, that was a bust.  Speaking of busts, I had some nice feedback on my previous post, which is encouraging.Even earlier, I posted about the demise of Polaroid film, and the media response to what is happening has been nothing short of amazing.  I think if anything, this has opened  people's minds to why Polaroid film is unique, and has no digital equivalent.  I hope someone rescues the process. I have to confess that I am tired of winter now.  This has been a strange winter.  If it were not for the frequent melt-offs and rains following snow accumulations, we would be up to our elbows in snow.  But, I also hate having it snow and then raining and freezing a few days later.  Ugh.  So, it's March 3, and I would like to see an end to gray days, and more sun and the hope of green.  Of course, I know we have at least a month to go before it feels really spring-like.I've been having fun with my Hasselblad - I finally picked up an 80mm planar lens with a hood for it for $260.  That would have been unheard of a few years ago.  Thank you, people, for dumping your beautiful Hassy gear and jumping to the Digital World of No End of Upgrades in Sight.  That makes using the Hasselblad affordable for me.  Now to pick up a couple more backs, and I'll be set for a while.So, appropriately, here are a few 'blad shots from inside the Conservatory at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, where it does not matter what time of year it is outside.

{"title": "Something Different From Me", "date": "Sunday, February 24, 2008", "text": "For some time, I've wanted to try shooting female nudes, and more specifically, I've been interested in trying what is called \"Boudoir Photography.\"  For one, I want to know if I am any good at it, and do I have anything to offer that makes my work stand out from others?  I don't want to be a glamor photographer, nor do I expect to try and compete with the pros out there, but I am interested in trying out some techniques and seeing if in fact, my results might be worthwhile, and if the person posing would be happy with the results.  Another thing -- the internet is awash with skinny, siliconized women, and I'm not interested in that.  Real women with real figures that can be photographed in a way that brings out their best, and leave some imagination for the rest. Maybe I'm a bit old-fashioned, but leaving some things to the imagination is better than showing every detail. To me, that's what eroticism is about.  So, last week, a friend of mine who was willing to be a test, spent the better part of an afternoon at my place and I shot mostly with my Nikon D-70 and an assortment of lenses and filters.  I probably shot a few hundred exposures, and was really happy with quite a few.  My lighting setup was pretty simple - two fluorescent bulbs with white umbrella reflectors, a large piece of white foamcore, lightstands, a backdrop for some shots, and a tripod  and a stepladder.  With the space available in my living room and the limited size of the paper backdrop, there is only so much I can do.  Some shots were done on the couch, which worked out very well.  I decided to forgo using flash, even though I have it available. I wanted the softer look of the lights, and that is why the tripod is so important.  So is making sure the model stays very still.  Overall, we were both happy with the results, and the time just flew by.

Since I am currently putting my shoulder and right arm through physical therapy, i didn't want to upset anything by bowling with it.  Truth be told, I really suck.  But since I might bowl once a year, what can you expect?  Instead, I decided that I  would bring a bag full of cameras and shoot film instead of a ball.  My cameras of choice:Nikon N8008 with Fuji Neopan 1600, 50mm f/1.8 and 24mm f/2 lens, no flash.Nikon FG with SB-16 flash and Ilford Deltapan 400, 24mm f/2 lensHolga with Fortepan 400 and external flashSo you see, no digital camera, just the gritty nuance of black and white film.  I had a good time, and my favorite shots were those done with the N8008 and the Neopan 1600.  The 24mm was a better choice than the 50, if only because it captured the lanes better, and manual focus works better in dim situations (it is an older lens converted to AI).The results, or at least some of them:"},
{"title": "Yet Another Blow - Polaroid is Dropping Film", "date": "Friday, February 08, 2008", "text": "According to the Boston Globe story, Polaroid is going to stop producing films within the year.  That includes the facilities in the Netherlands and Mexico that produce the consumer films.   I suppose one could say that it was inevitable, but maybe Fuji will acquire the remaining technology from Polaroid.  There are a bunch of highly-regarded fine art photographers that use large-format Polaroid film for their work; photographers that use the 600-series films for a variety of projects, and the artists that use emulsion lifts and transfers as their main biody of work.  It's a shame that the films will die.  Polaroid execs are quoted as turning to LCD TVs and digital cameras.  Great...just what we need - another brand name stamped on electronics from China.  It's too bad that the company that was once at the apex of inventiveness and technology (not to mention stock prices) has turned into a dim shadow of its former self.   It would be easy to blame the digital revolution for Polaroid's demise, and of course it has had a major impact upon a company that once employed 15,000 in Massachusetts.   I think there still has to be a viable niche market. I have to wonder if it can't be possible for some company to acquire the plants that make the film and run it as a boutique operation.  Come on, Kodak... time to get even and buy that Polaroid technology...So, if you stock up NOW on Polaroid film... you'll be okay for another few years, until it degrades and is no longer usable.http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifDamn.

I have never been disappointed with anything I have purchased from them.  The last time I did macro in medium format was about 7 years ago with my Pentax 6x7.  I wasn't terribly happy with my results then, but I'll attribute that to lack of experience.  The 645 is a lot easier to handle, of course, and has better metering than the humongous Pentax 6x7.  I also shot the images with TechPan -- the slowest emulsion available, but also the finest-grained.  I have to say that I was really pleased with my results.

One of them, a mystery roll, turned out to be a roll of Plus-X Pan that I had used in my Olympus Pen-D.  A half-frame camera that was quite sturdy and reliable, but I don't think I ever fell in love with the half-frame format.  I sold the camera to Kirk Teetzel last fall, and I hope he is enjoying it! This particular roll had sat in the camera for at least 5 years, as in the very beginning were shots that I recognized from our old house on Beacon Hill, followed by images that showed street improvements on South State, and other random shots; including a few from the Art Fair several summers ago, as the shot above of the Iraq War Boots Project that was on the UM Diag.    The last shot was of the \"Pringle\" over by the new Life Sciences complex.

{"title": "Another Great One Gone - Herbert Keppler.", "date": "Sunday, January 06, 2008", "text": "I learned tonight that Herbert Keppler passed away Friday in New York after a brief illness.  I know old photographers don't live forever, but I was surprised to learn that he was 82.  I always enjoyed reading his column in Popular Photography, and many times, it was the best thing in there over the last few years, as the magazine shifted towards digital doohickeys.  Herb Keppler was not a camera snob -- he tried all sorts of cameras and equipment, giving the readers a straight story on what he thought of them. At heart, I think he was a Pentax man, which makes a lot of sense, as he was the everyman photographer.  Adorama issued a press release about Keppler, and noted his long career in Modern Photography and later, Popular Photography.  He was editor and publisher of MP for 30 years -- an amazing longevity!   He also was a champion for photographic consumers as he battled against fraudulent advertisers.  His book,  The Pentax Way, is a classic, and of course, I have a copy on my shelf.  One thing that was not mentioned is that his father, Victor Keppler, was a renowned commercial photographer that pioneered the use of color photography in advertising.  Interestingly, his papers are at Syracuse University.Though I never met him, I bet he was a pretty straight-shooter (just as in the title of his later column) and a gentleman.   I think one thing that Popular Photography could do to honor him is to assemble some of his best writings and put them together in a book.  His honest, down-to-earth evaluations of cameras and equipment were greatly appreciated by many, and people like him are all too rare in the media.(photo from http://burtkeppler.typepad.com)"},

I came away with some memorable photos. Our trip to New York state -- Marjorie and I shot a lot of things, my favorite spots being the Amenia cemetery and Rochester - especially the Eastman house. Argus Day in August.  I didn't know that would be the last time I saw my friend George O'Neal.Shooting  the Huron mountain Club for a day.My friend Barb Dingwall's visit.  We had a great time. Seeing Marjorie's photos in Detroit Home magazine!Throughout the year, and for several years, I have maintained some great contacts via Flickr, as well as them becoming friends that are meaningful to me.  You know who you are, and I thank you for your friendship.Looking ForwardI am not one to make New Year's resolutions, so I won't resolve to do anything.  However, I do plan to finish up and publish my book on Toy Camera Photography;  get at least one photographic exhibit in; and sell more of my work. I want to visit Canada and do some photography in places that I think are interesting.I want to do some female figure photography and see if I am any good at it, or if I should stick to other things.I will eventually sell off all of the various photographic estates sitting in my basement.Do more darkroom printing.Lastly, photography is a great medium, and since I can't draw or paint nor sculpt, it's my way of showing other what I see.

{"title": "The Magnificent Medalist II", "date": "Wednesday, December 26, 2007", "text": "Over the years, the Eastman Kodak Co. has produced some wonderful cameras.  On the balance, they have also designed hundreds of somewhat crappy cameras, intended as cheap and reliable, if quite ordinary picture-takers.   So, for every  few dozen Brownies, Starflashes, Instamatics, and Disk Cameras, there is one meaningful camera.  You can count on fingers, the number of remarkable US-made Kodak cameras that were produced.I recently acquired one of them from the estate of my departed friend, George O'Neal.    This camera, the Kodak Medalist II, is a metal-bodied medium format rangefinder camera that makes 6x9cm negatives on 620 film.The Medalist II was produced by Kodak from 1946 to 1953, and was intended as a \"pro\" camera.  There are a additional backs that can be used with the camera, allowing one to do close-ups using the backs and sheet film.  The shutter ranges from B to 1/400 sec., plenty fast enough for most uses.  The Medalist II also has a flash-synch using the Kodak post and not a PC connector (which is unfortunate).   The lens turns out with a large helical that when fully retracted, locks the shutter release.  The film automatically stops and the shutter cocked when the film is advanced via the winder  (but you need to use the read window to start at 1).  The rangefinder window is somewhat puny, but it does work, and there is also a dial readout on the top deck of the camera to show the distance and depth of field.  The 100mm f 3.5 Ektar lens is highly-regarded and the out-of focus areas are smooth.I took the camera out yesterday to give it a try in the conservatory at Matthaei Botanical Gardens.  As it was my first time with this camera, I didn't expect every image to stand out, and for the most part, I am very happy with the camera.  I look forward to giving it more of a workout soon.A later image made on Kodak Gold 200 (620) from the UK:"},

Since I really don't need anything, but I did want the new Diana + from Lomographic, that's what I told her, and she did buy me one!  Now, I know there have been a few detractors of the new Diana+.  Of course it's a cheap plastic camera, but I have to say that I am impressed with the features, and that LSI didn't merely copy the old design, they improved on it, in ways that will please photographers that use Crappy Cameras.  The new pinhole feature is a great idea, and so is the little device they include to keep the shutter open for long B exposures.  The addition of the tripod socket is MUCH appreciated!  The hardcover book included in the kit is nice.  No doubt, it adds to the price tag of the Diana package, but I'm glad I have it.  Some of the writing seems a bit random, but the images are fun.I love this -- the perfect anti-techno gift with unlimited creative potential.  Better than tinkertoys, erector sets, and the chemistry set.  And, unlike the Red Ryder BB gun, I won't shoot my eye out.   But, I'll be shooting film, and that's what I am going to do this afternoon. Have a nice holiday, in whatever way you celebrate it."},
{"title": "Some Classy Argus Hardware", "date": "Saturday, December 15, 2007", "text": "I have been busy getting the equipment from George O'Neal's estate ready to sell on ebay, and it has been an interesting experience so far.   I'm enjoying the various cameras and photographic items, even though they are being sold.  I have long gotten over the urge to collect so many things, and the experience over the past year with several estates of deceased photographer/collectors has allowed me to handle a lot of cameras that I otherwise would never see.  In my case, handling these old cameras and sometimes using them for a short time is just fine, as I don't need to own a slew of old cameras.  I already have quite a few (as does my daughter Marjorie), and I have been paring down my collection a bit, as well.    Working with the cameras from George's estate has been fun, for the most part -- How many times might one get to handle an Ernemann Ermanox camera, or some other rare or unusual cameras?  Of course, I am not going to show those here, but instead, an example of what I consider to be one of the best American examples of a rangefinder camera.  Argus' C-4 was a sturdy camera, operationally and aesthetically  superior to the C-3 brick.  The only thing lacking with the C-4 was the ability to mount a lens other than the sharp 50mm 2.8 Cintar.  In 1954, Geiss-America Corp.  designed a lens mount to retrofit the C-4 to accept a series of lenses imported from Enna-Werke in Germany.    As far as bargains go, the $10 charged by dealers to have the mount added to the C-4 by Geiss was amazing.  It only was available for 2 years, from 1954-56, after which the C-44 appeared with its interchangeable (and inferior) lens system.   As much as I would have liked to have acquired a Geiss-C-4 a few years ago, I know I wouldn't use it much, even though it is a pretty nice system, so I didn't even consider acquiring it for myself from George's estate.  It will be interesting to see how high this outfit goes for on ebay."},

As it so happens with many of my non-work friends, we met online via Flickr.  Kate e-mailed me last night that she was being interviewed as part of a piece on social networks, and that the Ann Arbor News was going to send a photographer over to shoot us during our lunch-time meetup today.  We met up with Robert Chase, a long-time AA News photographer by the UM Union, and he followed us around shooting photos of us, and it was nice talking with him while we wandered over to the Law Quad on a cold snowy day.   Finally, we had enough of being out in the cold and snow, and returned to the Union for something warm.  Bob followed us there and took a few more shots and chatted with us while we warmed up.  Kate and I were both shooting film, and Bob of course, was using his new Nikon D300 - a very nice DSLR.  I was using my newly-acquired Nikon F, which made quite a contrast in technology.I pulled out my little Canon A570 and shot this photo of Bob Chase while not looking through anything, and fixed it up in Picassa a bit.  Anyhow, this isn't the first time I have been followed around by an Ann Arbor News photographer, and it will be interesting see what the article says and what image the editor decides to use.I find it interesting that some people feel that the Internet creates recluses --  but so far, in my experience, it has opened up new avenues, and provided me with new friends  that I have often met in person.

{"title": "Holiday Gifts for under 50 bucks", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2007", "text": "This is THAT time of year.   Unlike the stores, I do not get into Christmas mode back in September.  In fact, if it were up to me, I'd pass a law that said no x-mas songs, etc. until AFTER Thanksgiving (like it was in my youth).   So, in the holiday spirit, I am encouraging you to go forth and spend money that you probably don't have. You know, I'm as cheap as they come when it comes to buying things. However, there's cheap and there's frugal, so I am more likely to be frugal when possible.   I always want to get a good deal AND not go to Wal-Mart, so therefore internet shopping is my mall.    Unless you live in a cave somewhere, you also know that most photographic items are expensive -- Especially if they involve anything with a computer chip inside.    Well, shoppers, I have put together a motley selection of gifts for the photographer.  Not for me, mind you.  I already have these things, and I'm trying to be helpful here.  They are either Mark-tested or friend-tested, and therefore, not by a shill for some photographic magazine. These gifts are also not something you can buy at your local stores, so I will provide you with the appropriate web links.First on my list for the good girls and boys is a film-based camera, the Diana +, from the crazy-ass folks at Lomography.    I have not personally used this camera, but I have several friends on Flickr that have, and I say that even at $50, this camera could be one of the best things to have become available for toy camera shooters.  An improved version of the old plastic Diana, it also has a PINHOLE mode.  Wow!  See one of Becky Pendel's shots made in that mode.   You can buy the camera from The Lomographic Society, but you know, I prefer to shop at a place that isn't so crazy, so you can buy it at B&H Photo for the same price without the crazy navigation.Second -- You like Nikons?  You like T-shirts?  Then try this one on, because you can't find another like it except at my Cafe Press store!   Less than 12 bucks if you buy the cheapie one, which I find is just fine.  There is also a ladies' version.Third -- A year's subscription to Lenswork magazine.  Quite possibly the most interesting photography magazine out there.  No equipment reviews or any such thing.  Wonderful portfolios by people like you and me.  I believe Stieglitz would be a subscriber to this one.  You can even buy the entire 56 issues on CD if you are really feeling generous.Fourth -- The Gorillapod by Joby.  This funky bendable tripod can also be used to attach remote flashes to objects, so the small sizes would be perfect for that.  Nothing smaller than the largest size for an SLR.  For under 50 bucks, this is a great item for any photographer.  Works well with the Diana+ above.  You can find this item at most online photostores, and maybe your local store, too.Fifth -- Okay, this one is really a bit over 50 dollars, but if you use a Windows-based OS on your computer, you should buy Paint Shop Prop Photo X2 from Corel.  At about $60 for an upgrade, it has features that made me an instant fan, plus they have a promotion that ends up  with you getting a $50 VISA gift card if you buy the full box version for $99.  I like it so much, I just bought a PC in addition to my Mac so I can use this program for photo editing. I have been using Macs since they came out, so you know if there were a Mac version, I would be oh so happy...Last -- If you want to make a film-using photographer happy, go thee to the Freestyle site and buy some things!  This is my favorite place to go, and believe me, they cater to the photographic community.Have fun, and remember don't drink and do online shopping."},
{"title": "Living with my Canon A570 IS", "date": "Thursday, November 15, 2007", "text": "If you saw my earlier post about buying a new pocket P&S digicam,  you'd know that I have had this camera for about a month and a half now.  Any camera of the complexity of today's digicams has many features, and of course, a learning curve, as well as some time to get comfortable with a new toy.  Having taken the Canon A570 along on several trips, as well as carrying it daily, I feel that I certainly made the right choice.  I still like the optical viewfinder, and the menus are pretty easy to navigate, once accustomed to accessing them frequently to change settings.   I have been shooting a fair amount of film lately, and having this camera along as a supplement to using various crappy cameras as well as good 35mm and medium format equipment gives me another creative tool.  It also requires little space in my bag or pocket when I'm toting around a bunch of film cameras.The other half of the equation is the really nice Canon software.  It is easy to use, puts new images in folders by date, and allows me to edit and do some simple things with the Canon software, or go into Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 as my editor.  By the way, if one program can make me purchase a PC over a Mac, PSP X2 is it.  I love its feature set, and it makes a lot of things a one-click option to accomplish... such as putting a border around an image.  It's on my Dell Laptop, and I wish there was a Mac version to run on my Mac mini... which I just replaced the hard disk within.  That was not as hard as I thought it would be, but I still ended up reinstalling the system and some applications. My old disk was fried, for sure -- but I did have all my apps and files backed up."},

It was quite a while back that I encountered Barb Dingwall (highwaygirl67) on Flickr.  Her photos are of course, interesting and sometimes a bit mind-bending, but always done with purpose and I believe with some of that renowned Canadian sense of humor.  Last month I mentioned to her on Flickr that she should paw through the camera remainders in my garage if she ever got out of Toronto and came through Ann Arbor.  Well, it so turns out that she was ready for a break from Canada, and she and her friend Petra arrived in Ann Arbor Friday evening.They stayed close-by, and walked over to my house Saturday morning, whereupon I drove us to Ypsilanti for some shooting.  I chose Ypsi first, as it's a delightful place to walk around in the Depot Town area, and there are lots of interesting photographic opportunities in a small area. After shooting in Ypsi, we went back into Ann Arbor, and had lunch at Grizzly Peak (Petra's excellent suggestion), and then did some photo-exploring downtown and over the other side of Main St. into the Ashley/Miller area.  We dropped in on Ross Orr (voxphoto), and he joined up with us a little later and led us through some interesting parts of Island Park.Later in the evening, Ross joined us for dinner at my place.  I had a devious plan to ply Barb with wine so she would take back a bunch of cameras to Canada, and not realize just how many she was taking!  It worked well, as I think I filled a shopping bag for her. Sunday was time to return to Standard Time, which was good, as I needed that extra hour of sleep.  Barb and Petra drove over and we went to Matthaei Botanical Gardens.  It was Adrienne's weekend to work, so it was nice to see my wife's handiwork with the beautiful mum display and tell her while she was there how great it is.  Afterwards, the three of us headed over for coffee and food at the Moonwink Cafe in Dixboro Rd. right next to the Dixboro School, another fun place to shoot.   Then, it was off to Parker Mill, and after that, Dexter, where we visited some of my favorite spots to photograph.  Barb and Petra left for Toronto right after we returned to Ann Arbor, and I hope they enjoyed some of the places that we visited.   The two of them were great companions and we certainly had some good laughs.What I really enjoyed was meeting the person behind the Flickr avatar, and Barb was every bit as interesting as I thought she would be.  She is a  thoughtful, funny, and knowledgeable photographer, and I hope  to get over to Toronto sometime so she can return the favor of being a guide and shooting buddy."},

First, and foremost, was the big annual photographica sale put on by the Michigan Photographic Historical Society that took place in Novi on 10/14.  I had great help from my friends Ross and Amy, as we had a van full (and then some) of stuff to sell on behalf of MiPHS.  We did really well, selling about $1900 worth of cameras, accessories and books, and most importantly, ridding me of about 80% of what was being stored in my garage. The day before that, Dennis accompanied me to Historic Fort Wayne, just S of Detroit, where we met up with Ralph and wandered around taking shots (mostly with toy cameras)  of some interesting dilapidation at the fort.  Things are improving there, but nonetheless, the crumbling buildings are interesting material.Finally, this past weekend, Adrienne and I drove to Marquette to  see our daughter, Marjorie, and partake in a Parents' Weekend at NMU.

It is our annual Photographica Show, and runs from 10-4 at the Novi Community center.    My annual job is running the tables that the MiPHS is selling stuff from.  We are still selling off the remainder of the Naslanic estate, as well as some others, so this year will be a bonanza for someone, or many someones. As I have had the bulk of the stuff in my garage, I have been able to sort through it and price the nicer items that we will be selling.  Ross Orr came over last Sunday and helped out with that, so the SLRs and 35mm rangefinder cameras are set.  Speaking of rangefinders, it was fun to look at them again, and see how nice some of them really are.  Here are a few examples: The Ciro 35 Model S.  An American-made  35mm  camera, from Ciro Cameras, Inc. , Delaware, OH, 1949-1954.  Not a particularly exemplary camera, but it does have a rangefinder.   Value - $20 - $50.  Konica II - 1951 all-manual rangefinder 35mm camera; 1 - 1/500 sec shutter, 50mm f/2.8 lens.  Compact, all metal camera with a nice Hexanon lens.   Value-- $80-$120.  It's a beauty of a camera. Yashica YK --1959 Japanese rangefinder, Yashinon f/2.8 45mm lens, 1/25-1/300 shutter.  No meter.  Petri 1.9 Color Super -- An all-manual rangefinder camera from 1960.  This one, unlike many Petri cameras, seems to work just fine.  And, it is a pretty one!And the nicest one of the bunch, as far as I see: Futura S -- An incredibly cool rangefinder camera from Futura Kamerawerk, Freiberg, Germany.  1952-55. Synchro-Compur shutter, B-1/500, coupled RF, f/2.0, 50mm lens.   This one is a beauty and I knew I better photograph it, as I am sure I'll never see another!It's plain to see, just from these few examples, how much better the Japanese and German-produced rangefinders were compared to American-made counterparts from the same era.  Why buy an Argus C-3 when you can have a camera with more features, better appearance, ergonomics and lenses?  And for not much difference in price?  Even my lovely Argus C-4 pales in comparison to the Konica II.    That Futura-S is just beautiful."},

My requirements were:an optical viewfinderdecent array of controlsreliablemoderate zoom rangeruns on AA batteriesgood-sized LCD displaycompactless than $200Nikon eliminated the optical VF from their coolpix line, so they were out.  After looking at other cameras and reading many reviews, I came to the conclusion that the Canon Powershot A-series cameras were my best bet.    Although I am a die-hard Nikon person when it comes to film and digital SLR cameras, I wanted something that fit my needs, not a label, and the Canon Powershot A570-IS really attracted me.  It may have been Herb Keppler's article in a recent issue of  Popular Photography where he featured the Powershot A460 that made me take notice.  The A460 is a cute thing, and very inespensive, but lacks the manual control that I wanted.  The A560 didn't quite have all the features, but the A570 did.  For $50 more, I got a cameras that really has a lot of creative potential, and fits in my shirt pocket.  As you can see, the Coolpix 3100 was getting worn and scratched, and the 3.1 MP count was limiting.  With 7.1 MP, movie mode, Image Stabilization, et., etc., the Canon is a huge upgrade.

Wikipedia says this:Vernacular photography refers to the creation of photographs by amateur or unknown photographers who take everyday life and common things as subjects. Examples of vernacular photographs include travel and vacation photos, family snapshots, photos of friends, class portraits, identification photographs, and photobooth images. Vernacular photographs can also be considered types of \"accidental\" art, in that they often are unintentionally artistic in some way. Closely related to vernacular photography is \"found photography,\" which in one sense refers to the recovery of a \"lost,\" unclaimed, or discarded vernacular photograph or snapshot. Found photos can be \"found\" at flea markets, thrift stores, yard sales, estate sales, in dumpsters and trash cans, between the pages of books, or on sidewalks.-------Taking this into account, many people I know, including myself, are vernacular photographers, or at least will be, when we die and people find our boxes of prints and negatives, or our images on Flickr.  But is it really art?  As we all know, art is in the eye of the beholder, and yes,  there are some beautiful vernacular photos out there.  But since photography is all about capturing the MOMENT, are some of these better just because they have captured long lost moments that will never exist again, or are they art because they capture our imagination and engage us in some way.   I think unless someone is completely clueless with a camera, there always exists the possibility of making a great image.   On one hand, I have seen a person with the latest DSLR take shots that are so lacking in aesthetics that I wondered why they even bother; and I have seen amazing works of art taken with Holgas and box cameras.  So putting ability aside, if a photograph stimulates us in some way is it art? (Not that kind of stimulation!) - I suppose it is, but I think we have the \"lens of nostalgia\" affecting how we interpret many of the images from the past.  Four examples are presented below.Is this a work of art? God I hope not.  It's me from 1975 camping with friends. Is this a work of art?  Detroit, 1950s. This one?  New Jersey, 1890s.Or this one?  Take a guess. Some Vernacular sites you might be interested in that appeal to ME.The Found PhotoSquare AmericaLet me know what you think.    I'd like to think that many of my photos are works of art.  Others are just documentation.  But someday, they'll be vernacular photography..."},

No big photography show there, but I wanted just to view some of the galleries and it has been about 5 years since I was last there. First of all, admission is FREE. Second, they opened a new Glass Pavilion in 2006 across the street and it is amazing.  Third, I saw this amazing structure with the light hitting it just so, and had to photograph it.  It houses the school of Visual Arts for the University of Toledo, and was designed by Frank Gehry.  I shot some holga pics of it too, and will be hoping that they came out well.  I love the dramatic shadows and the form of the building, and the clouds were perfect.  It could be a really interesting place to shoot at dusk, too."},

Partly because I haven't felt inspired enough to do much shooting, and partly because I have been preparing for a sale of my stuff at the Ann Arbor Artisan's market at the end of September.  That wasn't something I had thought about until my friend Kate Kehoe convinced me to do it as part of being an Etsy seller http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5264351So, I have been buying materials, getting prints made, and assembling and matting and packaging my images.    It's not hard work, and I really enjoy cutting mats, but it does take up time in the evenings.  Hopefully, I'll have a good sale and make back some of the money I spent for materials.  I'm trying to price my work at various levels -- 5x7 small matted images for $6, 6x6 matted polaroids  for $25, 8x10 matted images for $20 (some are more), and larger pieces matted to 11x14 from $50 to $75, depending on the image.  Plus, my cards will be $3 each, or 6 for $15.    Nothing really expensive, and maybe I'll be able to sell some of the works that have been piling up in my work area.I'll also be entering 4 Polaroid images into a show in Hamtramck, MI. One of them is my favorite Polaroid shot.I hope nobody thinks it is worth $125.00, but if it sells for that, I am okay with it.The other things going on -- I'm  presenting a macro photography workshop at Big George's on Monday, October 1 at 6:30 pm.    I have to get some on-screen presentation ready for that, as well.   I also have things do in preparation for the  Michigan Photographic Historical Society's  annual photographica show on October 14, which is about 2 weeks early this year.   It will be held in the Novi Community Center, where it's been held for quite a number of years."},
{"title": "The UP is Where I Want To Be", "date": "Monday, August 27, 2007", "text": "On Wednesday, Marjorie, Adrienne and I drove N to get Marjorie back to school at NMU for her second year.  We took two vehicles, this time.  Marjorie drove her Jeep filled with most the stuff she needed for her dorm room, and either Adrienne and I drove the little Echo that had more of Mo's stuff and our own belongings for a 4 day trip.  The drive up went great, and Marjorie got all her stuff moved into the dorm in about 45 minutes.  That gave Adrienne and me a lot more time to do other things around Marquette, including the three of us going back to the Huron Mountain Club on Friday, where we shot a ton of images.   Sunset and Little Presque Isle from Presque Isle Park. While I was there, I reflected in why I like the Upper Peninsula so much, especially Marquette.  For one, the natural beauty of the place is amazing.  The Lake Superior shore is ever-changing, and the weather never fails to be interesting.  Marquette is a moderate-sized city blessed with a mixture of old and new, and the downtown is active.  They have several bookstores, coffeeshops, art places, and no pretentiousness.  The NMU campus has a nice art museum, lots of nice facilities, and a commitment to providing a good undergraduate education and learning environment, not the mega-sport, mega-money, and megalopolis that UM has become.   Outside Marquette, of course, there are all sorts of interesting places, and much of the area reminds me a lot of growing up in the Adirondacks, with the addition of the Great Lakes being nearby.  Some of the area is gritty, a reminder that not everyone has an office job or works for a University.  Oh, and there are a lot fewer people around.  Mountain Stream Falls in the Huron Mountain Club So, whenever I spend a few days in Marquette and anywhere in the UP, coming back to Ann Arbor is always a bit of a downer for a day or two.  As much as I like it here, and I do, I think Marquette would be the place that makes me whole.It was nice making a day of it at the Huron Mountain Club.  I had not been there since 2003, when I went up to receive an award for research done there.  This time, we went to see how things were going and to photograph some places that I wanted more, and better photos of.  The Jeep got us up to Mountain Stream Falls really quickly, and the rough road there was a good baptism for the Jeep.  I wish I had used one when I was doing research there  before -- it would have enabled me to get to many more sites in day."},

It was all the more poignant to me because George and I had met less than two weeks earlier at the Argus Day, and he had helped set us up at the Argus Museum for my talk.  We met at dinner again, and it was hard to talk because the bar was noisy, but George had told me that he wanted to meet with me again soon to talk about some things, and that was the last thing I had heard from him, other than \"Hey, it's good to have you as a friend, and I look forward to getting together.\"George was 79, and I know he missed his departed wife Gene very much.  She passed away from cancer about 4 years earlier, and I think I somewhat helped him climb out of the depression that gripped him afterwards. We would meet for coffee, or maybe just a brief chat, and he gradually became more involved in photography once more, and started showing up at our Crappy Camera Club meetings.   George probably felt a bit old with some of the younger crowd there, but I teased him that at least when he was there, it didn't make me the \"old man.\"  He had me over to his place a few times, and he had a nice exhibit of cameras and photographica, and he was always a gracious host.  I wish I had known George and Gene back when they were the stalwarts of the Michigan Photographic Historical Society.     The two of them started the nucleus of the exhibits at the Argus Museum in Ann Arbor. I know George really cared about that collection, and  he was really pleased that it has been so well-curated in recent yearsGeorge was interested in lots of things besides cameras and photography, such as minerology, genealogy, and traveling.  He grew up in Ann Arbor, was in the US Army from 1945-1947. He and his wife had five children, four who are still living, and nine grandchildren.  I will miss George, and I wish I knew what it was he wanted to talk to me about."},

Cheryl Chidester, the museum curator, was very gracious in hosting us, and also provided refreshments.  She has been doing a wonderful job with the displays and the change in the museum from what it was like 7 years ago is just amazing.  With donations from Argus collectors and the social network that the Argus Collectors Group has created, the collection has expanded both in the hardware, but also in the archives of printed material containing company history, employee information, and product R&D.  After I talked, people hung around and viewed the collection, asked questions, and then we all went out walking for photo opportunities, and were to meet at the Old Town for dinner.  It was a pretty good group of Ann Arbor Area Crappy Camera Club members that went out shooting.  A fun evening, for sure.  Earlier in the day, Marjorie and I had walked around campus taking photos of the area around the Law Quadrangle.  I think one of my best photos came from there. More photos are here"},

All I have left are a few rolls of 35mm and a roll of TechPan (120) to develop.  Once again, it may be the shots I took with the Holga and the YashicaMat A that become my favorites.Throughout central NY, one can find old mills and factories that have long been shuttered. Some are along the old Erie Canal, some along railroads, and others at the edge of cities and serve as reminders of past eras of self-reliance and Yankee inventiveness. Others are probably grim reminders of the toll of the industrial age - both in human and environmental aspects.This Seneca Knitting Mill sits in Seneca Falls, home of the women's suffrage movement in the finger lakes region of New York.

We were shooting until it was nearly dark, and then we went back a few days later to catch some nice afternoon sun which made some of the headstones stand out.  I shot with a variety of cameras, but most of my shots were taken with my Mamiya 645 and my Yashicamat A,  a Holga, and a few on 35mm.

My plan was to use film almost entirely, as well as leave the computer and DLSR at home.  Some people thought I was being an idiot for leaving the computer behind, but given that we were going to have very sporadic internet access, I figured it would be somewhat liberating not using a computer.  I was right.  I shot just a few images with my Cooolpix 995, and shot  25 rolls of film.  My equipment was a Holga, Yashica A tlr, Mamiya 645E, Nikon N80 and a Nikkormat FTN, and my Olympus XA2 pocket camera.  Our route was across OH and PA as we took I-80 over to Scranton, and then cut up towards Port Jervis, NY and the Taconic Parkway to Amenia.    While in Amenia, Marjorie and I drove over to Sharon and Torrington, CT, which was a beautiful drive.  I'll write more about some things we saw there later on.   We also managed to hit a few antique stores in Millbrook and other towns. We left Amenia on Monday, July 16 and proceeded to Poughkeepsie, NY and up to Hyde Park to see the Vanderbilt mansion.  Amazing place.   Then up towards Albany, and we should have stayed there a day, but didn't.  We spent the night in Amsterdam, NY (ugly place), and went W on Route 5 the rest of the way to Syracuse.  We stopped in Utica, which I had driven past many times in years past, but don't recall the city.  It was actually pretty nice, and we were treated to viewing the interior of a fabulous theater that was being expanded and renovated.  We managed to find a cool theater in every city we stopped at, which for Marjorie, was a great treat.  I'll continue on with the story when I have photos to post. I shot mostly B&W -- and I look forward to sharing my best images with you. Back to the darkroom..."},

A predecessor of the Spotmatic series, the S3 lacks a meter and a self-timer.  It has speeds from T and B to 1/1000th sec.  This particular camera is a beauty -- the chrome is good and it seems to work just fine.  Considering that it is about 42 years old... that is amazing.  It handles well and is a joy to use.  I can adjust my exposures  using the \"Sunny-16\" method, or use a hand-held meter.    Teamed with the 1.8 55mm auto-Takumar, or a 135mm f 2.8 Mamiya Sekor M42 lens, I ought to get some nice shots. Roger Hicks has a nice article about the precursor to the S3, the HV.The Fujica ST801 - a full-featured M42 camera, made by Fuji, 1972.Another beauty of a camera is the Fujica ST801.  With depth of field preview, LEDs in the viewfinder for adjusting exposure, B- 1/2000 sec shutter speeds, and a nice viewfinder, it might just be the ultimate M42 camera to use those old lenses on.  I used this one last week and was pretty happy with my results.Maybe you have an old screw-mount (M42 mount or Praktica mount) SLR.  Dust it off and try shooting with it.  If it is working properly, you find the inescapable feeling that you are using a fine piece of camera gear.  Those old Spotmatics, Ricoh TLS Singlex, Chinon CM-3, and similar cameras can still enable one to take some pretty damn good photos.  For more information on screw-mount cameras, try the M42 camera site."},
{"title": "Minakta or Exolta?", "date": "Sunday, June 17, 2007", "text": "Over the past few years I seem to have accumulated some Exakta cameras and lenses.  In fact, my first SLR was an Exakta Exa 1a, back in 1974.  That camera, though primitive compared to the standards of the day, taught me a lot about photography and served me for a number of years.  I sold it quite a while ago, and a few years ago, acquired another Exa.  I don't use them all that much, but they are interesting and somewhat peculiar SLRs.  You can read a lot more about Exkata cameras on the Exaktaphile's web pages. I was recently looking through a box of miscellaneus adapters and found a peculiar little lens adapter from Minolta - the \"E adapter\".  Ha!  An Exakta lens adapter for Minolta cameras. That was rather surprising, but since I have an M42 mount to Minolta, I guess it makes sense.  There were a lot of decent lenses made for Exaktas (and Topcons that used the Exakta mount at one point), and putting them on a more modern camera body makes sense.  I got out my Minolta X-700 (a fantastic manual camera, in my opinion), and put on the adpapter.  I then attached one of my Exakta lenses, a Zeiss Jena Tessar, and I had a 56 year old lens on my camera, and I could shoot in aperture prioity if I wished.  Cool.  Now I'll goof around with these things and will post some images of my results later.As much of a Nikon lover as I am... their mount pretty much is Nikon or nothing.  So, it's fun to able to play around with other permutations of lenses and cameras.  OK, so you Canon Eos people have had all kinds of adapters for years.Here are some images of the gear:"},
{"title": "Amazing Find", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2007", "text": "If you have been paying attention to the photo history groups recently, you might have heard about the fantastic discovery of the darkroom in France, left untouched since 1855.   Tim Atherton's Muse-ings blog has a nice summary with photos of the darkroom and some bio on the photographer, Fortune-Joseph Petiot-Groffier who died in 1855.  Not too surprisingly, I had not heard of him, but I suspect his name will become more commonly seen in the coming months as  his photographic  time capsule gets cataloged and written up by curators in France.   I think it's amazing that a room would be locked and left untouched for that long.  I'm also wondering what kind of state the chemicals are in.  The compounds that were used in those days were not necessarily the stuff you'd want to inhale, unless you wanted a shortened life.  Daguerrotypists exposed themselves to mercury fumes...not good.  However, reading a bit more about Petiot-Groffier, it seems that he moved over to Talbot's Caloptype process, which would have been a good move for many reasons.  As interesting as Daguerrotypes are, they are a dead-end process.  Every image is unique, since there is no negative to make more copies with (geez, sounds something like Polaroid).   Talbot's negative/positive process is the one that we use today in analog photography.  The materials are better, more sensitive and more varied, but I'll be Henry Fox Talbot would feel at home in a modern darkroom, and presumably, so would Mr. Petiot-Groffier.

{"title": "Memories of a Good Friend", "date": "Sunday, June 03, 2007", "text": "On June 2, we had to euthanize our Sheltie, Mac.  He was 11 1/2 yrs old, and although he'd had his share of health problems over the past couple of years (repaired ACL, and hip arthritis, etc.) up until a bit over a week ago, he seemed to be doing okay.  Then, he started having problems, and although I kept some hope that he would rally, in my heart, I knew that the end was near.  It was a very emotional week for me, watching my beloved dog become more decrepit each day, and though I know he struggled valiantly, I could see the resignation in his eyes by the end of the week.  I cried more over his frailty than anything, and on Saturday morning, we carried him to the front lawn where he could enjoy a  few hours of fresh air, some sun, and our love.  Then, we drove a mile to our vet, and laid Mac on his dog bed while he recieved our final goodbyes and we held him and cried as he died peacefully and with dignity.  That was the hardest thing to do, and it still brings tears to my eyes as I'm still grieving.  I know that it was time...and I think he did in a way, too.  I can't imagine the pain of his arthritic hips, and the indignities he went through towards the end.We plan on taking Mac's ashes and scattering them in places he enjoyed.  The best thing I can say is that he was a loyal, playful, smart, and lovable companion and added so much to our lives since I first held him as a puppy.  He loved to catch frisbees when he was healthy and in his prime.  He was protective of our cats.  He didn't bark a lot -- until his hearing started to get bad.  His fur was soft and whenever we gave him a brushing, it seemed that there would be enough hair to make a sweater from.  He traveled well, and loved to go camping with us, and follow on hikes.  Everyone that knew him loved him, and I shall always have a piece of me that is missing with his absence.  Adrienne was the one that usually brushed his fur, and as much as he seemed to not want to get it done, he resigned himself to it.  Marjorie loved Mac, and this was very hard for her, too.    There are many memories that I have from his 11 years with us, and those, along with the images I have of him won't leave me.I decided to go through som old zip drives and see what old digital images I might have of Mac.  I have some shot with one of my earliest digicams, The Logitech photoman - in monochrome in 1996.  Then, another with an Apple Quicktake 200 in 1998.  I'm actually surprised that I found them.  They are not the best shots of him, but they are typical of the usual pet shots that one takes. - Mac only a few months old...

{"title": "Playing With Polachrome", "date": "Tuesday, May 22, 2007", "text": "OK, yes, it's another post about me playing with an expired film again.  This is more than expired -- it's no longer produced.  My friend Geoff Foster gave me a cassette and the processor cartridge of Polacolor 35mm film.  It is a 35mm transparency film that was produced by Polaroid up until maybe 5 or 6 years ago.  Before the days of Powerpoint, it was great to have a film that could be quickly processed to make slides for presentations, etc.  Polaroid produced several high-contrast films for that purpose  (I have shot a roll of Polablue film) for graphs and text, but Polacolor was intended for full-color rendition of a subject.  At an ISO of 40 -- not a fast film and kind of grainy.  As you'll see it has its own look.According to the Land List:  * Film speed: ASA 40  * Color  * Sold in 12 and 36 exposure rolls.NOTES: Polachrome is the technological successor to the Polavision instant movie system introduced in the late 1970's. [See the notes regarding Polavision Type 608 film for some details about how this film works.] By the way, one significant difference between Polachrome and Polavision film is the way the 'negative' is handled. [All Polaroid instant positive films involve a photographic negative somewhere, even if you don't normally see it.] With Polachrome, the negative is part of that black coating you can see on the film during loading. This black coating gets stripped away at the end of the development process, leaving just the positive transparency. The black coating (assuming it strips off the way it's supposed to) ends up back in the processing cartridge, which is then discarded. The old Polavision film, however, had both film and processing materials within the same self-contained package, so there was no way to 'discard' the negative after development. Therefore, Polavision film was designed so that the negative layer would simply remain on the film, but turn transparent after a short period of time. Apparently, this process wasn't quite perfect, and resulted in somewhat reduced contrast compared with the newer Polachrome film.--------------------------------------I tried the film out today -- put the roll into my Minolta X-700 to give that camera some use for a change.  I didn't know if the film had lost any sensitivity, but I shot it at and ISO of 40 just the same.  This evening, I ran the film through the Polaroid Autoprocessor -- a box with cranks that winds the film along with its processing cartridge, and after about 2 minutes, the film was ready to take out and examine.Unfortunately, the black backing (the negative) did not come off in the processor, so I ended up soaking the film in fixer for 5 minutes and then washing in water, and ran the film between my rubber-gloved fingers to pull the stuff away.  It worked, but the emulsion is pretty soft, and I ended up scratching the transparency film.  In any case, it was interesting to play with the film and the fact that I got anything at all was a complete surprise!Here are some results:"},
{"title": "Series Filters, Part 2. (soft-focus)", "date": "Tuesday, May 15, 2007", "text": "A few weeks ago I wrote about the beauty of using series filters with cameras. To refresh your memory, series filters are filters of discrete size ranges that fit inside special adapters that can be found to fit a variety of cameras and filter thread sizes. For example, Series VII filters are a good size for most 35mm cameras. Shown above is a special diopter from Tiffen (Vari-close-up lens) that is focusable and fits on the front of my Nikon Series E lens with a series VII to 52mm adapter. This particular close-up lens has a focusing helical that also provides adjustable magnification.  With the 50 mm 1.8 lens wide open, I can get dreamy, soft images with glowing out-of focus highlights. If I stop down to 5.6 and smaller, I get more typical-looking macro shots that are not at all dreamy, as the lens aberrations in the Tiffin filter  become a non-issue at smaller apertures.  I also think it has something to do with the way the light hits the sensor on my D70.Some samples at f 1.8: You don't need the same exact Tiffen lens that I used.  You can use any single-element diopter and get a similar effect.  In fact, there are a number of series filters for diffusion -- they were big for doing portrait work, and depending on which filter one uses, differing amounts of image softenss will result.  You can even combine several diffusion filters for extreme effects.  Or, combine a diffusion filter with a diopter.  You can do that with series filter holders, since many will accomodate different thicknesses of filters.  Then, all you need is a series VII to whatever filter ring size that you need for your lens.  I suggest finding a Series VII to 52mm or 55mm for starters, and using step-up or step-down rings as needed. It doesn't even have to be sitting on an SLR or DSLR -- how about trying this technique out with a Holga or Diana?  Of course, the instant feedback of the DSLR  is wonderful, and you can explore all sorts of filter permutations and apply what you learn to film cameras.  Give it a try.  If you can't find a series VII or VI filter holder, drop me an email, as I have many boxes full, and can set you up pretty cheaply. I do have a few of the Tiffen vari-close-up lenses for sale at $35 each.  When they are gone, they are gone!For the past few years, there was a unique online store where one could buy all kinds of black and white films -- 120, 35mm, and various custom sizes of sheet film.  J&C Photo was a responsive seller, and offered a variety of emulsions (especially from European manufacturers as as Efke, Maco, Foma, etc.) at really good prices.  Alas, on May 12, they posted that despite their best effort to relocate their business in Nevada, things have fallen apart and they will no longer be an entity. It's entirely possible that the problems in getting supplies from Europe have added to their their troubles, as well as the shrinking film market.  I still think that a boutique store of this type could make it, but I don't know what kinds of problems they were having that led to their closing up.  I really liked their custom film sizes, and am now kicking myself for not buying a bunch of 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 sheet film.  I do have a box of 2 x 3\" sheet film from them, so I can at least put it to use in my baby graphic.Thanks, J&C -- I have missed ordering from you.  Freestyle is now the only place that caters especially to film users, so I suggest that you support them.Photo taken of the road just S of Northport, WI (Door Peninsula) - Kowa Six, J&C 200 Classic Pan film."},

We took the scenic route  (as if there are any others here) and had a good trip, getting back to Algoma about sunset.    I think my personal favorite was Cave Point County Park on the E side of the peninsula:Really nice limestone cliffs overlooking Lake Michigan.  We really don't have rocky cliffs along the Michigan side of lake Michigan -- it's all sand.  Of course, this Niagara Escarpment phenomenon is pretty damn cool, with Silurian limestone everywhere.  We also visited the Ridges Sanctuary near Bailey's Harbor -- too early for dragonflies, but they'll be out soon.   It was interesting seeing so many places not open yet as the tourist season isn't really underway here until after Memorial day. We finally found a coffee shop that had just opened for the season near Gill's Rock.  Might have been the best cup of coffee I have had in a while. Although the sky was mostly overcast, it was a great day, and we saw quite a bit  along the coast.  Heck, we didn't even make it into any antique shops -- and there look to be some really nice ones here.  Next time."},

Our plan is to do some photography in Door County today, and then head home to Ann Arbor tomorrow.  I was in Sturgeon Bay and Bailey's Harbor for a few days in 2000, when I attended the Hine's Emerald Dragonfly conference at the Ridges Sanctuary.   Since then, I have grown as a photographer, as 2000 was when I started taking it seriously.  It will be an interesting day, I'm sure!This morning I woke at 6 am on my watch to see the sunrise out the window.  I grabbed my camera, realized that I left the tripod in the car, and just went sans support onto the blacony overlooking the lake, and shot a bunch of  frames, supporting the camera as steadily as possible.  Marjorie joined me, too.  Then realizing it was a little after 5 am local time, we both went back to sleep."},
{"title": "Serious About Series", "date": "Sunday, April 22, 2007", "text": "I'm not talking about the NHL playoffs here. Really, I'm not.  I'm promoting what is considered to be a dinosaur in today's photographic world.  Back in the day -- not so long ago, really-- the USA made the bulk of their little photographic gadgetry, especially things  like filters and the metal adaptors that fitted them to your camera.  At one time, not all cameras had screw threads in front of the lenses, and there were no \"standard\" front diameters like there are with SLRs.  Whereas now we have 49, 52, 55, 58, 62, 67mm, etc. filters, years ago there were only what are known as Series Filters.  A Series filter was given a designation as IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, or IX.  Each progression of the Roman numeral designation meant a larger diameter filter.  For example, Series V filters are 30mm across, Series VI are 40mm, and Series VII are 50mm. You could find an adaptor that fit your lens, and the Series filter merely fit into the adaptor with a screw in retaining ring holding it in place.  The beauty of this scheme is that you could own a bunch a different adaptors that used whatever diameter filter you needed.  Some adaptors snapped over your lens, some have bayonet mounts, and some are standard filter-ring diameters that we are accustomed to using today.  You could also find lens hoods that used the Series designation.  The reason I am bringing this up is that although I have been using these filters for some time, lots of people know nothing about them.  If you are using vintage cameras with odd front filter diameters, then the Series filters are a great thing to know about.  For the most part, they are no longer being manufactured, but if you attend any photo show, you'll see some.  Those circular Kodak filter boxes that are an art deco yellow and black are a giveaway that there is probably a series V, VI, or VII filter inside.  I also recently picked up several hundred (thousands?) of the filters and the adaptor rings from an estate.  Amazing...Series VI filters are great for rangefinder cameras, and Series VII and VIII are especially useful for SLRS.  You can find + and - diopters, 25A red filters, yellow filters, diffusion, and more commonly, color correction filters.  With a few metal adapter rings and some commonly-used filters, you'll have some very useful tools available to you. I'll post more about them later this week."},
{"title": "Kindness of Friends", "date": "Tuesday, April 17, 2007", "text": "Last night, my friend Cynthia dropped a brick on me.  Actually, it was three bricks -- of Kodak's TechPan film. A brick contains 20 rolls, for a total of 60 rolls of this amazing film.  Turns out that they were going to discard it at her workplace, and she intercepted on my behalf, knowing that the surest way to make me happy is to give me free film.  Even though the film was dated to expire in 1985 and 1992, I am pretty confident that it will be okay.  For one, it's a very slow film, rated at 25 ASA, it's black and white, and it's a very stable film.  I'll shoot a roll of the oldest batch first and see how it turns out.  Tech Pan is one of those marvelous films that Kodak produced, up until about 2 or three years ago. One of its primary uses was in graphic arts, as it could be shot as a high-contrast film for non-continuous tone images, or as a continuous tone lower-contrast pictorial film -- depending on the developer that you choose. Technidol LC is my developer of choice for this film, but one can use other standard developers at low concentrations to get a similar effect.  I have also read that Tech Pan was used a lot in astrophotography since its resolution is extremely high.  Did I mention that it is virtually grainless?  One of the selling points was that it produced images in 35mm that rivalled medium format negatives.  It's true. It does.  Shooting 120 TechPan is therefore like shooting Large Format.  That's true, too.Unfortunately, TechPan is no longer produced, yet highly sought after.  I sold 4 rolls of non-expired TechPan a few months ago on ebay for over $100.  Crazy.  A lot of people have probably stockpiled supplies of the film, and for good reason.  I will use mine, and I still have a few hundred feet of bulk rolls of TechPan in my fridge.  Geez.  I'm sitting on gold, um, I mean silver. Here are a few sample images from TechPan:"},

For those people  that actually knew Monte Zucker, I know they'll miss his presence.

Yes, the sought-after Pentax K1000 is the camera that has most often been sold and recommended as the \"Student Camera.\"  Pentax must have sold millions of them by the time they retired it from production in 1997. Reliable, simple to operate, and with lots of lenses available, these cameras are still highly prized by anyone wanting a basic, no-frills SLR for photography class.  The SMC Takumar lenses are very good... and the 50 mm \"normal\" lenses are sharp.Karen Nakamura has a nice write-up of the K1000, and I highly recommend her wonderful website.  Matt Denton  also has a nice page on the K1000.You can download a free manual from Pentax, too.  Sure, it's a simple camera, but remember -- students have to learn sometime.So, while I have this camera for a short while (It'll be sold for the Michigan Photographic Historical Society), I'll run a roll of b&w film through it and test it out.  I hope it eventually ends up in the hands of an appreciative photography student.  Then he or she can shoot film and see the wonder of this medium.Other things:An interesting article appeared in the NY Times about the chemistry of non-digital photography - really interesting, with obvious sleuthing aspects.The  Cheap Shots Exhibit was reviewed in today's Ann Arbor News by John Cantu.

The opening reception for the Cheap Shots show Friday night was a resounding success, as many visitors crammed into the gallery and in the hallway and overflowed into the arcade below.  I'm estimating we had over 150 people pass through the door, and thankfully, not all at the same time.  The gallery was packed, and rather than take up space best saved for viewers, I spent a lot of time at the street level, chatting with friends and visitors to the show. We had plenty of wine and munchies, and luckily, no street people caught whiff of our free booze and food.  If any did, they managed to look no worse than the photographers.    Thanks to Geoff and Stephen and their spouses for putting on a great sperad of food.  I had not eaten dinner before the opening, so it was nice having something to eat and not just crackers and cheese and wine.Marjorie  shared a ride down from Marquette, and got to be at her first gallery showing of some of her work.  It was wonderful to have her home for the weekend, and she really enjoyed the opening and talking to people. It was a great evening for Krappy Kameras and good photographers.  There were workshops held on Saturday and Sunday which were well-attended enough to pack the small gallery space.

A nice medium-format SLR that I am liking more  every time I use it.  Marjorie and I went on a short road trip Thursday -- off to Three Rivers and Kalamazoo, MI.  Travelled along M60 to Three Rivers, and encountered some towns we had never been through before - Homer, Mendon, and Schoolcraft, to name a few.  We saw that they are renovating or restoring the Riviera Theater in Three Rivers, and a nearby warehouse had all the seats and fixtures stowed there for restoraton, which was quite interesting to see through the big windows.  Later in the day, we walked around downtown Kalamazoo, met an interesting photographer named Norman Carver and stopped at his gallery.  Afterwards, we met up with Erin Dorbin, a member of the Krappy Kamera Club, and shot some more around Kalamazoo.  Erin and I were each carrying a Kowa Six.  That was fun!"},
{"title": "Keeping It Simple", "date": "Thursday, March 08, 2007", "text": "chimney abstract Originally uploaded by mfophotos.When I am out shooting, it's great to be walking around somewhere, even if it IS winter in Marquette.  I was there last week as we travelled to the UP to get Marjorie for \"Spring\" break.    I had a morning to kill, so Adrienne and I drove to several spots along the shoreline  in and outside the city.  The wind was brisk, and even though the real temp. was not below 25 deg. F., the wind chill was brisk.  It was not the time to be running about with a bunch of toy cams and lenses!  So, I had my Nikon N80 with a 50mm 1.8 lens.  That's my idea of simple, I suppose, though it could just as easily have been a Nikon FM and a 50mm lens.  I decided that I was going to shoot TechPan that day, as the film's tonality would be great for these winter scenes, and the lack of grain will later provide me with the ability to make decent-sized enlargements.  With an ISO of 25, it is  a good choice for a bright cloudy day in the winter...even in Marquette.  The second part of \"Keeping It Simple\" is finding good graphic elements that are strong, yet have detail, such as this chimney coming out the end of a quonset hut next to Thill's Fish Market in Marquette near the lake.   As soon as I saw this in my viewfinder, I knew it was a keeper."},
{"title": "Nikon F Classic Beauty", "date": "Sunday, March 04, 2007", "text": "Nikon F beauty Originally uploaded by mfophotos.The estate sale is over, and time to reflect on one of my purchases  -- this very minty Nikon F with a plain prism, for example.  One of the classiest of SLRs, this particular camera was made in 1965.  It hardly looks worn.  If it had been used to take 360 images a year (that's 10 rolls of 36 exposure film) - that would be a little over 144,000 exposures.  I doubt it was anywhere near that.  The Nikon F was introduced in 1959, and quickly became the PRO camera of choice.  If anything, it also signalled the soon to be dominant Japanese camera industry.  Even though Minolta, Pentax, and Canon had SLRs with similar features, none had the \"system\" that Nikon introduced.  None of them  had the ruggedness and other features that have been the hallmark of the Nikon \"pro\" line of cameras.  Sure, the Nikon F might not be the feature-laden wonder that we see today, but it doesn't need batteries, gives 100% coverage in the viewfinder, and takes an enormous array of lenses.  I have wanted one of these plain-prism Fs for quite a while, and ebay prices for them are ridiculously expensive.   So, I was pretty amazed to see a bunch of them for sale from the Naslanic estate, and because I had been sorting cameras all day, I got it at a very good price.   I can carry a little Gossen Scout light meter with me for tricky lighting situations, but otherwise, I don't need to have a meter on the camera.  Yeah, this is almost like wearing bearskins and using spears for some of you out there..."},

A long-time camera enthusiast passed away in late October, and the fellow, in his 80s, had been a founding member of the Michigan Photographic Historical Society.  He owned this house for a long time, and used it mostly as a place to store his hoard of accumulated cameras.  According to his nephew, who has the task of emptying the house for sale, it was wall to wall with stuff with little aisles to walk through the 1500 square ft home with a finished basement.  The old man had spent many years accumulating this stuff, and it had taken over his life to the point of being a sickness.  The irony of it all, is that he had a card on the wall, stating he was taking it all with him when he died. So what happened is that the nephew has to sell the house of course, and the Michigan Photographic Society is doing the work of sorting, identifying, pricing, and arranging to get this massive amount of photograhic material into the hands of others to make some money for the estate.  The society  gets a 20 percent cut, which is pretty fair.I spent 7 hours there yesterday, sorting, identifying and pricing cameras.  I handled hundreds and hundreds of cameras. We found many gems among the stones, and even the pebbles were interesting.  We found some pricey items like a Canon rangefinder - a beauty of a camera similar to a Leica, Leicas, Contaxes, more Nikon Fs than anyone should have,  a pallet of Polaroids, obscure little French cameras, Graphlexes, mounds of crappy caameras, Dianas and a phalanx of clones, SLRS by the boxful, box cameras by the boatload, armies of Arguses... do you get the picture? I have never in my life seen such a house filled with stuff like this.The sad part of it all is that this guy would shlep stuff to sell at the camera show and never sell anything because he always, always had it marked too high.  Rarely did I buy anything from his table, as he evidently thought the book value was the going rate. Sure it is, for highly desirable items.  But he never had those out. In the end, we'll be able to buy it for pennies on the dollar in some cases. This also points out  a few things.  When we collect, we should be discerning in what we collect.  To merely accumulate a houseful of EVERYTHING photographic isn't collecting, it's accumulating and hoarding.  Nobody benefits.  The guy picked his stuff up at garage sales, estate sales, and wherever he could get a bargain.  He rarely passed the stuff on to anyone as far as I know.  If you wanted a Diana, by God, you were going to pay $50, because that is what they sold for on ebay -- never mind that he had somewhere around 50 of them, and   they were in a box...somewhere.So, yes, collect and enjoy your treasures.  But if they are sitting in boxes and bags all over your basement and around your house, it ain't a collection. It's a tragedy.The sale announcement is here."},

I found a box of cameras, and every one of them was $10 or less, which is quite find.

It was as shiny and new as the day it was sold, and I figured it deserved to have its photo taken with a camera of the same vintage, an Argus C-3.  This little tableau brings to mind Kodak's current state of affairs.  The announcement  that Kodak may spin-off its film business is a crying shame.  The CEO  Perez (a former H-P officer), is determined to make Kodak and entirely digital company, that will, in the end, have no products that distinguish it from all the other companies they are competing with. I can imagine George Eastman rolling in his grave.  OK, you idiot. Sell off the film business and have it re-emerge as the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company once again.  To the new company -- promote the hell out of film and show why it really is archivally superior to digital in so many ways. Don't forget the millions of feet of movie film stock that you produce is vastly superior to the digital movie experience.  Promote it, and compete with Ilford, Fuji, as a film company can, and accept the smaller niche.  I think if that happens, things will work out.  But  Kodak might have to dump their CEO no matter what, once they lose their cash-making division, and people stop buying whatever digital products Kodak is making in favor of others like Fuji, HP, Canon, Epson, Lexmark...

Last year, Marjorie saw a Hasselblad 501CM at Big George's and with some trading, and a generous discount, she soon was the owner of one of the best systems available.  I, being cheap, or at least bargain-oriented, wanted a similar camera, but with affordable lenses.  I love twin-lens reflex cameras, but they can be fiddly, and hard to find the appropriate filters, etc.  In addition, they generally suck at doing close-ups.So, even though I have a Mamiya 645E, and Pentax 6x7, I really wanted a better square format camera to replace the Kiev 60.  My obvious choice, going the non-Hasselblad route, would have been a Bronica SQ series.  Expandable, reliable system with different backs, prisms, etc.  Not too expensive, either.  I looked at KEH and saw I could put a kit together for less than $400.  I also saw how some people really liked the Kowa Six and Kowa 66 cameras.  Their relative simplicity, nice ergonomics, well-regarded optics, and beauty intrigued me.  Then, I saw one on ebay with no bids for $149.00!  I put on a bid, and fully expected to be outbid.  There were no other bidders.  Within a few days, I had the camera in my hands, complete with a manual (yay!) and lens cap.   The film spools through inside like a Rolleiflex, as the back is not detachable.  But it also allows one to use 220 and 120.  Great option!  I borrowed Marjorie's Hasselblad strap, and took the camera out yesterday. It was bitterly cold when the wind was blowing.  The waist-level viewfinder and beefy controls allowed me to use the camera with golves on and not frost up the viewfinder.  Wonderful backwards images appeared in my ground-glass screen.  I shot a roll of Tri-X that came with the camera. Not bad.  I love it already.  Now I am selling my Kiev 60 on ebay.  Anyone need a camera that will stop a bullet?"},

Of course, I wish we had served wine -- I might have sold a few more photos!It was a tremendous ego-boost, obviously, but I also enjoyed hearing WHY people liked certain images, which were their favorites, and explaining what toy cameras are all about.

I was originally going to put up 20 to 24 photos, but the space wasn't really enough. At first I was disappointed that they had been short on the hangers, but after I set things up, it worked out just fine with 18 framed images. John Baird came out at 4 to help out, and his attention to detail was very helpful.  We figured out the spacing, etc., and at 24 inches apart on center, there was room enough for 18.  I had the hard part of deciding which images to hang, but I think that was actually a good thing.  It made me decide which images were strongest, and not that the \"rejects\" were bad, but I think the culling made for a stronger presentation. However, I am sure if I polled 10 people about which ones to include, I would have had 10 different answers.A little later, my neighbor Andrew showed up, and he and John finished the little tasks of rolling up the wires, and Adrienne helped me with the legend cards.  In all, it was pretty easy and a lot of fun, once I figured out which photos to hang.  Before we left, several students were looking at the photos.  I hope I inspire a few to use a toy camera.Tomorrow is the reception, and I think I will have a great time!As this is my first show, I had a lot of angst over the images -- which ones to print, the type of paper, etc.  I worried about how people would react -- they are toy camera images, not photographs made with the type of control that I would normally use.  They aren't snapshots, either, but things I see that affect me in ways only I know.  So, it's been an emotional rollercoaster getting ready for it, and I think it's okay now for me to say, \"no hands!\" Ha- I just realized that I should put in the info about the show itself!And some self-promotion.

His sale is this (Jan 25) Thursday through Sunday, 9-5, except Sunday at 11-4.  The location is 23404 Sherwood, at Lozier, in Warren.  I was just in there around Sept? October?  There was a LOT of stuff.  It was nicely organized.  Lots of enlargers, large negative carrier ones too.  Don't know if there are any images.  Probably some store fixtures.\"Well, I wasn't about to jump in the car and go during the week, but I figured that Saturday, there might still be some goodies remaining.  I contacted some local photography friends, and we all took off in my van Saturday afternoon.  We arrived at a somewhat decepit-looking cinderblock building in a light industrial/residential area that looked like it had seen better days.   We knew it was the place when we saw the film dispensing units arrayed outside the door.  We walked in and it was a mess... stuff was everywhere.  Now, of course, the sale had been going on since Thursday, so the very best had been taken already... but still the amount of  photographic stuff - from camera cases to chemicals to expensive machine lab equipment was everywhere.  Room after room.  It seemed like a demented version of colossal cave adventure -- go L, there is a darkroom... go R, there is a door...open the door... you see boxes of stuff... you get the idea.  I really wish I had taken a digicam along to show what we saw.  Unfortunately, most of the paper we saw that was remaining was for color processing - commercial stuff.  I am reluctant to buy any opened boxes of photographic paper.  But, I did find a bunch of film, and put most of it into a bag.  I found some photographic books (they had lots) that I liked, and some developer, and that was about all I could really buy as I had (stupidly) not gotten a bunch of cash beforehand.  Thankfully, Ross loaned me $7, so I could get all that for $20.  Matt picked up 20x24 packages of Kodak elite paper - wonderful stuff - for $5.  Anyhow, it was a surreal experience, picking through the place -- it seemed at times that things were left as they were at quitting time one day, and nobody ever cam back to work there."},

There were two rolls of Ilford HP-5 that I ran through D-76. One roll was from a few weeks ago, and I knew what I would find on that one.  The other, I could not remember what camera it came from before I put it in the developer.  Afterwards, as I removed it from the developing reel, I saw a bunch of images that I could not place at first.  Then, I realized I had shot the roll of film in one of my cheap plastic 35mm Vivitar cameras, and most were from a trip to the Thumb region Marjorie and I had taken back in late April. A few of them are surprisingly good.  So, as the title says, it was a pleasant surprise.  In a way, it was like taking that trip all over again, since I had to look on our marked up roadmap to find where I had taken the shot of this abandoned schoolhouse in Lapeer County."},

I took some shots in my yard on Sunday, when it had really just started. But on Monday, the ice was just amazing, with the trees, grasses, shrubs, etc. coated with ice. I took a few shots on the way in to work and on the way home. For someone that has spent most of his 50 years in a northern climate, you'd think I had never seen this before.  Well, since we have had such an un-wintery winter up to this point, perhaps it's partly because of the change in the weather.  However, usueally when we have an ice storm, it melts off in a day or so.  Not this time, as the weather has turned colder (last night it was 12°F), keeping the ice on everything.  This means we'll see a plethora of images from the past few days.  This is good stuff. It makes people look at nature a little differently, and makes photography so much fun, even when my hands get cold through the gloves.  Those people that have to move to Florida can stay there.  I like variety."},

This one is particularly sad, because it's obvious that the store had been there a long time.  A brick and mortar camera store has a hard time surving today between the competition from the big-box stores, office supply stores, and of course, the Internet.  Digital has become so pervasive in the marketplace, that consumers shop  at a computer or office supply store to buy cameras. This has had a devastating effect on the \"traditional\" camera stores. Ann Arbor has lost several photo stores over the years - Quarry Photo, Purchase Camera (1980s), Dave's Photo Emporium (2005), and more recently the local Adray Camera store (2006).

I can't predict the future, so I'll say something about the past 12 months instead.  Photographically, it has been an amazing year.  I have met a lot of new local friends via Flickr -- we have had numerous meetups, gone to several museum exhibitions, and hoisted beers and cameras together.  The Ann Arbor Area Krappy Kamera Club (TM) formed back in April, and  since then, we have also had monthly meetings, shoots, and in a few months will have an exhibition in town.  My daughter Marjorie graduated from high school, and is attending Northern Michigan University as an Arts and Design major.  I'm immensely proud of her and the photography that she has been doing.  I'd like to think that I have had something to do with it.  We have gone on many trips around the state in her pursuit of old theaters, and she has only a handful left to photograph.  Hopefully, she'll do something wonderful, like write a book with those images.  My wife Adrienne has been very supportive in my photographic endeavors, and I know she has probably felt like a camera widow at times.  But, I couldn't do any of this with her doing all the things that she does.  She's my biggest fan and an honest critic.Throughout the year, I have made many new contacts and I would especially like to thank Mike, Matt, Ross, Erich, John, Sam, Andrea, Kate, Doug, Cynthia, Sid, and Abby for their friendship and good humor.  It's amazing how a circle of friends can grow when certain interests are shared, and photography and the arts in this corner of Michigan is alive and well.Lastly, I'd like to list the top 5 local photographic events:(1) Edward Weston exhbit in Muskegon (fabululous)(2) UMMA Photographic retropsective (amazing)(3) Michigan's Family Album exhibit in Lansing (overwhelming)(4) Ansel Adams Polaroid exhibit in Grand Rapids (surprising)(5) Annie Liebowitz at the DIA (even tho I missed it-- I heard it was great)----One month from tomorrow, I'll be having an exhibit of my own... stay tuned."},

The fog was not thick everywhere, and by the time I got to the park, it certainly wasn't ideal, but it was there.  I hauled out my Pentax 6x7 and my Coolpix 995, and shot a roll of b&w film, and a few digital shots, as I figured I may as well since I drove over.  The digicam shots didn't look too bad, and I'll see how the roll of film came out later on.It's been a fun week away from work.

{"title": "Playing with a Pen Cam", "date": "Sunday, December 24, 2006", "text": "If you have been following my photostream on Flickr, you probably have seen a few recent images taken with my Aiptek MegaCam - a 1.2 MP digicam that is a bit over an inch square and a hair over 3\" tall.  It's called a pencam, due to its shape.  Now normally, I like to get as many megapixels out of a camera as possible.  My first digicam was a Logitech Photoman  - a b&w digicam with an image size of about 490 x 360 pixels.  At the time (mid 1990s), I thought it was amazing (and of course, had I been serious about photography, I would have dismissed it).  My next digicam was an Apple Quicktake 200, which produced 640x480 color images that were actually of decent quality.  Still, though, it was pretty low-res, but not bad for web stuff.Since then, I have used increasingly complex digital cameras, and my current digital SLR is a Nikon D70s. It's an amazing camera, and pretty much does whatever I want, except shoot b&w film, but that's another story.  Anyway, I have been doing a lot of \"toy camera\" film photography in the past few years, and recently became curious about those bottom-feeding digital cameras, the 10-dollar keychain cameras.  I then saw a reference to the Aiptek PenCam, which is selling for 9 dollars (!!) as a refurb unit online.    DIGITAL VIDEO & PHOTOGRAPHY \"On the Cheap\" has a nice review of cheap pen-cam style cameras, and trying to use them with the Mac OS. Of course, ideally i'd like to be able to use this camera with my Mac, but since i have a Dell laptop, I can email the images to myself, etc., if I need to.  I bought the Aiptek MegaCam a few weeks ago, and for a cheap little 1.2 MP camera that's not much bigger than a cigarette lighter, I am very impressed.  It's got some quirks, but if used within its limitations, it takes pretty good snapshots for web use, and the colors are saturated.    It's my digital Toy Camera, since I have no idea what my results are until I upload the images to  my computer.Definitely a fun toy, and at the price they are selling for online, I can see someone buying them as party gifts!"},

{"title": "Father Christmas", "date": "Wednesday, December 20, 2006", "text": "Last Thursday evening, my wife Adrienne and I joined a bunch of her co-workers at Aubrey's Saloon in Ypsilanti's Depot Town.  I brought my bag with a couple of toy cameras to do some shooting later on, since I had yet to do my night photography assigment for the Ann Arbor Krappy Kamera Club.  We had some beer and food, and said our goodbyes, and I went back to the car for my tripod.  There is a really neat alley/park that looked good in the night light, so I set up my Holga and took one time exposure.  Right afterwards, David, Will, and Connie came around the corner, heading for the parking lot.  Will was dressed as Saint Nick from the party earlier in the day, and as I saw him there in the alley, I told everyone to get out of the way and for St. Nick (I mean Will) to freeze.  I opened the shutter for about 10-12 seconds, and that was it.  I had no idea what to expect on the film.  That night, I developed the film, and it wasn't until I scanned in the negative the next morning that I realized that I had indeed, captured Father Christmas in a sort of timeless, ambiguous image.    It's not really a posed image, because I never expected Will at that spot, but I was prepared, which was a good thing.  I'm sure I can improve on this image, but I think the spontaneity and charm might be lost were I to do it with a plan in mind.I shot the rest of the roll and none of my remaining images were as interesting as the one above."},

It's a way to pull out recollections from seeing an image that means something to us.  We may not remember a face in out memory too well, but when we see a photo of a long-lost relative or friend -- we know them immediately.   A photo can remind us of what has been gained -- or lost. In this instance, I realized on Saturday that two old Cape-Cod style houses on Packard looked to be slated for demolition any day. I stopped by Sunday and took a few cameras, and took a few photos...It's a shame that these two interesting houses were let go for so long.  I'm sure they were built in the 1930s -40s.  People lived there and watched the neighborhood expand around them. Now, after having been vacant and unloved for several years, crews came in and took out all the trees and shrubs, and I am betting that the houses will be gone this week and replaced by who knows what.From a photographers's view, these houses are rich in texture, and the Techpan film really captured them.

{"title": "Rouge, Revisited", "date": "Wednesday, December 06, 2006", "text": "For those that love the industrial landscape, there are few places that evoke the awe of America's industrial might like Ford's River Rouge complex.   First photographed by Charles Sheeler in the late 1920s, the Dystopian landscape of the Rouge complex is a fascinating conglomeration of steel, brick, smoke, and glass.  More recently, the English photographer Michael Kenna spent a great deal of time over a decade ago photographing the Rouge complex during the twilight hours, evenings, cold weather, and gloomy days.  The University of Michigan's Museum of Art (UMMA) is now presenting an awesome exhibit of about 75 of Kenna's Rouge photographs at their offsite gallery on South University.I went there last night with Adrienne and some of my local photography buddies, and it was an enjoyable hour looking over Kenna's images.  The industrial landscapes, often abstract, sometimes grand, and sometimes peotic depictions of industry, are truly wonderful.  Deep luminous blacks, great tonal scale, and intimate print sizes (I think no larger than 6 x8\") invite the viewer to get close and examine the details, or to just step back and see the abstract shapes of the complex.  Smokestacks with vaporous apparitions, repeating shapes, nocturnal ghostliness, and beautiful reflections on water provide an amazing array of superb photography. Most of the prints appear square, so of course, we photographers were wondering about the negative format, and we still are curious as to why they were all labelled as \"Sepia toned\" when at least to our eyes, they had the look of split-toned images or Selenium.  I may just have to ask the curator. I like the look of this off-site gallery.  For one, it's a nice space for photographic exhibits, as showcased by this extensive showing of Kenna's Rouge series of images.  It's intimate enough to feel like a small gallery, but large enough to really have a decent-sized show.  It's also flexible in regards to partitions, so viewers don't feel like they are in a cavernous space like the main gallery in the UMMA. If you have a chance to see the Kenna exhibit, you should go (it's also free).  Not only is it of regional interest, but it's just wonderful photography that is well-presented.  See the UMMA web site for times, but the exhibit runs from Dec. 2 to January 14."},

This is the \"Champagne\" version -- a little sexier than the more common black and silver model. Original price was about $15, this one was $5 + shlepping.  Not as pristine as I had hoped, but I'll see what kind of shooter it is.  It does have Bulb setting as well as a tripod socket... so fun will ensue.  It came with a finished roll of Kodacolor II.   Not sure if it'll be worth developing, though.   I have been wanting one of these for a while, and if memory serves me right, one of my vintage camera buddies had great success with his.

Last night I finally printed the negative and was blown away by the image.  Had I really taken that?

I confess that there is really nothing I need this year.  But perhaps you, dear reader, are wondering what to get for a favorite photographer, and maybe you need to leave a hint for your favorite Santa. It's been a good year for photographic books, and my favorite book this year is Plastic Cameras  by Michelle Bates. This 228-page book published by Focal Press (ISBN 0-240-80840-1) is an excellent guide to the history of toy camera photography, with many prime examples of photographic excellence by other photographers (some of whom are on Flickr).  Plastic Cameras also has chapters on how to use the Holga, how to modify it, and tips for shooting. It also has an index!  I like the way this book inspires me to try some things out, and I believe that Plastic Cameras is a must-have for anyone using toy cameras, or if you want to inspire someone else to try them.  Obviously, available at discount from Amazon.com.Of course, to go with the book, you might need a Holga camera.  In Ann Arbor, Big George's Home Appliance Mart on Stadium Blvd. has them - Mike Myers tells me it's the best-selling FILM camera in the store.  Otherwise, get online to Freestyle  and buy a Holga there.  Don't forget 120 400-speed  film.  Arista.edu 400 from Freestyle is a wonderful bargain at less than $2 roll.  Of course, if you can't develop your own B&W, I suggest Ilford XP-2 in 120 format which is a C-41 process film.  For color, any 400 iso film will do. There -- all your shopping done for less than $60.  Don't forget a card.   You can buy mine online at Cafe Press.  I'll thank you for that --  and, don't forget a mug or other item for the non-photographer!"},

Not that I don't already have enough TLRs, but I enjoy using them, and every one has a special place in my heart.  This one is no exception.

So, at minimum, this camera is 36 years old.

For me, it's a fun diversion now and then, and I appreciate the work of others, but it's not my favorite mode of making photos.  However, for our latest Krappy Kamera assigment, we are supposed to modify a camera or make a camera, so using Ross Orr's instructions, I modified a cheap little Vivitar 35mm camera with a 28mm lens, into a pinhole camera.My only problem is that the hole for the part that housed the lens is a small circular opening, and I had to file away some of the opening, but not so much that I could not use the sliding lens cover  as a shutter for the pinhole.  As a result, my images are circular, but overall, it was a pretty easy conversion.

I spent most of the day behind the table for the society, hawking our items for sale (all of which were donated), and having a good time talking to people.  One of the things we had was in our silent auction -- a big box of about 75 rolls of old film -- 127, 620, 120, 116, 616, and 828.  I won that item for 25 bucks, which is a pretty good deal, even for old  b&w film.  A lot of it dates from the 1970s, which is pretty recent compared some 620 I had that expired in 1961.  It was still useable, so I'm guessing that the Verichrome Pan in this lot isn't too bad.  There are a bunch of rolls of old Kodacolor X  (C-22 process) in 620 that I will probably sell or give away just for the metal spools.  It will be especially interesting to play with the 828 and 127 film.  There were some funky brands in there that have not been seen in a while, and I'll just keep those as examples.

Four of us went together in a van, and had no problem with Canadian or US Customs.  It had been a few years since I'd been in Canada, and the quick way to Rochester was through Canada.    We arrived Friday afternoon, and the evening's get-together featured free drinks.  Everyone received a free copy of a huge volume on Steiglitz's photos, courtesy of Eastman Kodak! Saturday was cool and cloudy, and all of the presentations were at the George Eastman House (GEH), the premier center for photographic history.   The first talk of the day was on the history of digital photography -- it was by far, one of the best presentations that day, and also very informative.   The rest of the presentations were certainly informative, and like all symposiums, the quality of the presentations varied.    There are clearly some amazingly knowledgeable people out there, and I came away with a head full of new facts and ideas.some nice colorful Brownie Starflash cameras at GEH.I didn't get too much time to fully explore the GEH, except for the newest exhibits and the gift shop -- which was damned good for a lover of things photographic.  Of course, what I really would have liked to have seen is a Kodak Factory Outlet store!    I did pick up some nice books, and a GEH hat.

What better place to go, than the cradle of American  photo industry -- the city of Rochester.

I don't shoot slide film like I used to.  I remember coming back from a week-long trip to New Mexico in 2003 and sending off something like 30+ rolls of slide film for processing.   Most of my color work is digital now, unless I am shooting medium format or playing around with vintage cameras.  However, every once in a while I like to shoot some slide film, if nothing more than to keep me honest.   Now, I might shoot less than a dozen rolls of 35mm slide film a year, but I still shoot a LOT of B&W.I put a cassette of Ektachrome 200 ED in my Nikon 8008 - back in August, and finally got it processed last week.  The color palette of slide film is so different from digital.  The ED200 isn't as fine-grained as the 100, or even Kodachrome 64.  But -- it has a depth and pleasing appearance that digital just does not have - yet.I have a roll of really old Kodachrome 25 in my Nikkormat.  I shot some not so long ago, and the color looked great for 25 year old film!With scanners being so cheap today -- transparency film is a blast  - especially with medium format cameras.  It really is much easier than the old days  when one had to get an internegative made from a slide if you wanted prints.  Now - just scan and you are good to go."},

I was driving down a dirt road a few weeks ago in Sharon Township, and the afternoon sun was just perfect for those richly-colored shots.  Some warmth from the low angle, nice raking light, and of course, a picturesque subject helps, too.  I shot this with a recently-acquired Brownie Hawkeye Flash (BHF) -- I picked up 3 cameras on ebay for $13.50, which included the shipping. I was using expired Agfa Optima (125) film, which has great saturation.  I am always amazed every time I get a roll of nice images from these cameras, but maybe by now I shouldn't be.  They have attained a semblance of cult status among certain types of photographers, and given that they sell so cheaply and produce such decent results, I am amazed that the prices haven't gone up.  However, Kodak made a bazillion of them, so there is a huge supply of them out there (unlike the Diana cameras, which now go for as much as $75).  If you want to try something a little different, get yourself a BHF.  Make sure that you have a 620 takeup spool for your 120 film, and if you are not developing your own film, remember to ask  the lab to return your spool."},

I had passed by the fence going the other way an hour or so before, but on the way back the sky and the sun were perfect.  I had to pull over on the dirt road and capture this moment.  The white fence dividing the earth from the sky and few puffy clouds were a perfect moment.  It was one of those times that something just grabs me and I have to shoot it.

Kalamazoo, Lansing, and Dexter were also represented.    We started the evening presenting the results from our assignment, which was to do a photograph, or series of photographs, representing something about the future.  A couple of people really got into presenting some future scenarios, such as Mike's \"Skin Farming\" series.  His narrative was hilarious, and the images very imaginative.  I followed with a demo on mounting and matting using both archival methods, and the dry-mount press.  We had planned on watching the movie \"Pecker\", but it was getting late.  It certainly was a fun evening, meeting some new people, as well as meeting some people for the first time that I have \"known\" on Flickr for quite a while.Erin (e50e on Flickr) was having a great time shooting some of my old cameras with her Holgaroid -- which was also a very interesting camera on its own!

On Sunday afternoon, I was asked to photograph some equipment at a threshing/baling gathering in Bridgewater, MI.  My friend Dick wanted me to photograph the old Ann Arbor Baler that was there -- a model he had used as a kid.  The baler used Sunday was made in Ypsilanti, MI - sometime in thw 1920s.  The entire operation is very labor-intensive, and it took at least 4 guys to slowly turn the pile of wheat straw into bales.   Other than the intrinsic antique mystique of such a process, one has to ask why?  Of course, these guys were not using old equipment to do their every-day farming, but found a satisfaction in using cantankerous old machinery that was 80+ years old.  Just to show that they can.  That sounds a lot like why some of us use old cameras.  Not that we can't get a good image quickly from a modern camera -- but the old gear forces us to slow down, savor the moment, and try and get the best image we can out of sometimes cantankerous old cameras.  So, even though the guys there didn't realize it ... that guy with the fancy cameras has a lot in common with them.  Of course, my camera collection takes up a hell of a lot less space than their old tractors, balers, and threshers!By the way, I was there for a little over an hour, and shot about 200 digital color images, and 45 black and white film images with my Mamyia 645E.

Funny how  things turn up.  I scanned several of the negatives, as I don't recall ever making prints from them -- I'm really pleased with the images.  I have taken a lot of color slides of Ives Lake and Stone House in the Huron Mountain Club while I was doing research there a week or so almost every summer, from 1984 - 2003.  I don't think any of them have the emotional appeal that the shots from the Holga do.   Of all of the places I have been in Michigan, the time I spent as a researcher at Ives Lake remain some of my best memories. The quiet lake with it silence punctuated by the loon calls, is a place that I have been priviledged to stay at.   I may never have a chance to go back, and there are some shots that I know would be an improvement over the ones I took back in the 1980s and early 90s.

One of the things I have enjoyed this summer has been the numerous short trips my daughter and I have taken, and the myriad of photographic opportunities that have arisen during them.  Sure, we all have a destination to get to.  But instead of taking the interstate and main roads all the time, consider a lesser highway, another route, or even dirt roads (which are still plentiful in Michigan).  The beauty of going somewhere without a plan -- other than to be flexible-- is that you see things.  See a cool barn?  Stop along the road and take some photos.  See a neat little store?  Stop and go inside.  It's likely that you will find something that appeals to your interests on such a trip.  I hate to use a cliche title from a book, but \"The Journey Is the Reward\" is appropriate in this case. I used to be rather introverted, not talking to people, and believe it or not -- shy.  Becoming a photographer changed a lot of that.  Of course, I hate the typical... \"are ya taking piktures?\" but the camera has often become an introduction into what I do, and sometimes, talking to someone for 5 minutes will give me more information on a place than I could have ever found out on my own.  For instance, earlier this summer, we stopped at a small place called Montague.  There was a sign for an old drugstore still hanging at the entrance to what looked like an old-fashioned place that had a real old-time soda fountain.  I told my daughter we should go in and get something.  As the woman that served us made our chocolate malts, she told me that her father had owned that drugstore for many years, and had to sell off most of it to have money to pay for the care of his ailing wife.  The duaghter owns a part of the building, and she's operating the section that was the original soda fountain -- everything there was vintage 1940s-50s green and chrome.  She buys parts on eBay.  I never would have known all of that if we hadn't talked. Of course, the malteds were good,  and only after we got in the car did I realize that I had spilled some all over the front of my shirt..."},

Saturday, we started with Frankfort, Point Betsie, Empire, Glen Arbor, Suttons Bay, Traverse City, and Elk Rapids.  We spent a lot of time in Traverse City, and even saw Michael Moore there, promoting the Traverse City Film Festival, which looked like a lot of fun.  I can't begin to describe many of the sights that we saw along the way.  The rolling hills of  orchards and vineyards,  farms and gardens, beautiful cottages and awesome houses, small towns with character, and the many things that say \"this is Michigan.\"  One of my favorite images so far is this one from Portage Point on Lake Michigan, near the small village of Onekama.  When I think of lake Michigan shoreline... this image is the quintessential embodiment of that.  Not so much the lake itself, but the sky and the dunes, and the grasses.

This shot was taken by the Meteor, and it was the first roll that I had run through it.  I'm quite surprised at the results... they are not crappy.  The film is J&C Classic Pan 200, developed in Diafine.  I'm not one to go shooting with a crowd, but in this instance, it forced me to come up with some subjects in a short time.

I doubt that most people realize that Ansel Adams did a lot of pioneering work with Polaroid films and their cameras, and was a good friend of Edwin Land.  Adams felt that the instant process was a great idea, and did a lot of testing for Land.  The latest exhibit at the Grand Rapids Art Museum -- \"Ansel Adams and Edwin Land: Art, Science and Invention - Photographs from the Polaroid Collection\" is a really interesting look into that collaborative venture.  Obviously, Land felt that having a highly-regarded photographer of Adams' stature work with the new materials would be a vindication of the new process, and not only did Ansel use the films, he did extensive testing.   The letters, test photos and eventual fine-art photographs produced with Polaroid films and cameras, are a remarkable exhibit from the Polaroid Corp.  I have read Adams' book on using Polaroid materials, but did not realize that many of his highly-regarded works of later years were produced with the Positive/Negative B&W Polaroid films.  That was a new revelation for me.  In addition, there are many works by Adams that Edwin land purchased from him  -- BIG prints that probably graced his offices at one time.  It's a really fine exhibit that includes color SX-70 images, as well the b&w works.  It certainly should not be missed by Polaroid devotees, nor by lovers of AA's work.    The exhibit runs from June 23 - August 27 of this year.Another exhibit running concurrently is that of  Architectural Photography by Hedrich Blessing Studio -- \"Building Images: Seventy years of photography at Hedrich Blessing.\"   There are some amazing examples of fine architectural photography from this Chicago firm.

I find it ironic that HRD is touted as a bike route, when in fact, it has to be the most bike-unfriendly road around.  Scenic, yes.  I once biked from Ann Arbor to Dexter along that road, and if anything, the road has gotten worse.  There is virtually no shoulder along the entire route, and cyclists hang out into the lane - especially when they ride 2 abreast.  So, I would rather they biked elsewhere more friendly.  Oops that is so un-PC here...Anyhow, we arrived at  Dexter and got to the old train depot about 2 minutes ahead of a Conrail train, which was a pleasant surprise.  Took a few train pics, and then we shot film of the depot, some renovated buildings nearby, and the Dexter Mill.  I used my Nikon, Holga, and Polaroid, and Marjories used her Hasselblad and digicam and Holga.   We then drove through Dexter to Issland Lake Road, then Dexter Twon Hall Road, Tiplady Road, ending up on Gregory.  We then took Gregroy road and some other roads, ending up in Mason.  We spent a few hours there shooting photos of the town, and visited a real nice assemblage of antique stores.  I ended up buying a Tower 50 camera for $10.  It's a 1953 era 35mm camera.

It's at the site of the former Ypsilanti Farm Bureau on Huron River Drive, and many of the buildings there are being used by the brewery.  I had set up my tripod with my Mamyia 645 across the street, and while shooting some frames,  I noticed a shirtless, burly guy with long hair and a beard come walking purposefully across the street from the brewery.  He asked if I was from the city assessor's office.  I looked at him blankly and asked what he meant.  I told him that I was an amatuer photographer, and always had wanted to get a shot of this scene.  He explained how much trouble they had with the city while getting this brewery operational.  We talked a while about small businesses and how hard it is if you don't have someone in City Hall on your side.   I haven't been by there since then, and I do hope they are successful in getting things going.  We need more people like those in the Frog Island Brewery to operate locally-owned small businesses in places like Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor.  They are willing to take the risk -- our cities should be helping them as much as possible.I still haven't developed the film from the Mamiya.

I'm certainly extremely proud of her, and her accomplishments.   On the other hand, we know that this is just the first step on the way to becoming an adult, with all the responsibilities and more education to come.  She thinks that way too much is made of HS graduation, because it should be expected of everyone.  I think she has a point there.  For some kids, this may be the end of any formal schooling, other than the hard knocks of life.  It may be the last time that they had an opportunity to learn with some superior, and dedicated teachers that want them to excel.  For others, they will move on to various schools or perhaps trades that will give them more skills and knowledge to have creative, productive lives. As I said, it's really more of a beginning than and end.Marjorie will attend Northern Michigan University this fall, and likely pursue studies in art and desgin, and history.

We took mostly back roads, going up M52 to Stockbridge, then some really back roads, going through Leslie, then through Mason, Charlotte, and over to Holland.  From there, we went south to South Haven, Benton Harbor, and est over to Hartford, Paw Paw, Augusta, and finally home on I-94.    We put on about 400 miles, and saw a lot of sublime things that one can only appreciate driving around.    The flock of turkeys with several toms all puffed up; beautiful fields of crops just coming up; vineyards with the carefully managed vines; old decrepit barns --some on their last \"legs\", and others not decrepit, but painted and kept up (like the one shown).  The amazing county courthouses in these rural counties - where the county seat is not necessarily a big place, but the solid limestone or brick buildings give a sense that government matters; the significant number of Tacquerias in areas that depend upon mostly Hispanic laborers for the production and harvest of our fruits and vegetables; the beauty of downtown Holland, and the fact that there is so much one can see if you really look.    It was a fun trip, and Marjorie photographed 11 theaters, including an unexpected drive-in in Van Buren Co."},

That of course, requires a time exposure on the \"B\" setting, which also requires some sort of sturdy support.  Oops, the Diana does not have a tripod socket - imagine that.  So, I cobbled together a tripod attachment point using Velcro and an old flash holder.  It actually worked pretty well.

I tried using HC110 developer (dilution B) and guessed at 6 minutes, because there are no guidelines for this film as a pictorial film, other than what is on Digital Truth.   I think I guessed pretty close, as the negatives looked good and scanned wonderfully.  I'll try 5 minutes another time and see how it compares.It's too bad Kodak does not market this as a still film.

This is an unusual occurrence, and I spent 45 minutes later in the day taking photos of Collosus  up in the Mammal Division.   Most of those shots were taken on film, except for a few that I did on the 2mp camera.  The one above is of the gorilla's hand, desaturated, duotoned, and saved as an RGB image.

Being able to visit a particular area on a regular basis means that one is more likely to get the kind of photograph that one wants, rather than being stuck with whatever presents itself when one is just passing through.  This farm is a good example.  I first noticed the yellow fields of canola about 4 years ago, and took some photos that first time.  They were ok, but I felt I could have done better.  Of course, by thye time I got my slides processed, the canola flowers were gone.  Then another year they grew something else, and another year, I just missed the flowers.  This year, I drove past and saw that the flowers would likley be  at peak within a week or so.  In addition, the field was on the other side of the farm from where it had been before, making for a potentially more scenic shot.Yesterday, Marjorie and I drove out in late afternoon, and everything looked pretty darn good.  Unfortunately, I had forgotten to put my tripod in the van, so I had to use a fencepost for support.   I plan on going out Sunday morning with my Pentax 6x7 and taking some shots on transparency film...and use a tripod.The point is, familiarity with your subjects will improve your photography.  The best shots of anywhere are most often taken by the person that spends a lot of time there.  So, find your favorite spot and keep shooting."},

You will have seen many of these images in photographic history books, but these are the real deal.  Not only that -- think of it -- all are from one museum.  I'll be going back again.  When I see all these great examples from various photographers -- one man really stands out -- Edward Weston (surprise).  Others will undoubtedly have their favorites.  Be sure to visit the paper gallery in the basement, as there are some wonderful examples of Hollowood glamour photography that are part of the exhibit.

{"title": "Oh, How I love Tech Pan!", "date": "Monday, April 24, 2006", "text": "tangles    Originally uploaded by argusmaniac. Yup. I do.  And a lot of you are wondering what the hell I'm talking about.  Last year, Kodak stopped producing  Technical Pan Film.  A b&w emulsion that can be used as a high contrast film with one developer (such as D-19) for pure black and white images, or as a lower-contrast pictorial film with a wide range of grays using Technidol developer (or some other common developers in weird dilutions).Ahh, you are probably saying, \"So it's just a b&w film...\" yes it is, but one without any appreciable grain at big enlargements.  It's also very slow -- ISO 25, which in today's high speed world, is glacially slow.  But, that slow speed means 1/60 at f11 on a sunny day.  Or, use  tripod.  What you get are amazing enlargements from a 35mm film that look as though  they were shot in medium format.The beauty of different films (especially b&w)  is that each film has a different character, different spectral response, different grain -- and grain dependent on the developer used, as well as a \"feel\"  that is SO different from digital.  I am not a big fan of a lot of photoshop post-processing.  The problem with digital b&w, is that every image has a sameness to it -- no grain, no \"bite\", no serendipity.  So, I am not anti-digital.  But I am PRO- b&w film for a lot of good reasons.  The sad part is, Kodak stopped making TechPan, but lucky for me, I have about 300 feet of it in my fridge.  So, I'll just keep shooting with it until it is eventually gone forever.  I just found this interesting article on a small resurgence in b&w photography here. So, you see there IS an alternative to Tech Pan. Image info: Shot in Livingston Co., MI, April, 2006, Nikon N8008, Nikkor 70-200 AF Zoom, Techpan developed in Technidol, per box instructions.

We drove up to Saginaw, getting on M-13 from below Birch Run, and took the scenic route, which is what a Road Trip is all about.  The journey is the reward kind of thing.  We spent a couple of hours in Saginaw, which has a lot of pretty architecture, though some parts of the city could use some urban renewal of some kind. The Castle Museum -- a former Post Office is a wonderful piece of architecture, and right next to that is the Hoyt Library, built in the late 1800s -- a Richardsonian Romanesque beauty!  Marjorie also photographed two theaters, and some other structures -- the Second National Bank building is an ornate beauty.We then made our way on M13 to Bay City.  We were very surprised with the beauty and busy downtown of Bay City. Lots of antique stores, and quite the contrast between Saginaw and Bay City.  We spent several hours there (and of course they have a STATE theater), and enjoyed walking around.  Lots of small shops and eateries to explore someday.We then made our way to Tawas along US-23 -- a route I have not been on in quite  a few years.  Pinconning, Standish, and Tawas are all interesting small towns.  I did bring along a Polaroid camera to complement the Nikon D70s, N8008; Diana, and plastic 35mm camera.  I surprised myself with some very nice images from the Polaroid, which is the featured image here.We logged about 370 miles, and thankfully, Marjorie drove most of the way back, as I had a nasty headache that only got worse after I got home.

I looked. At first I didn't see anything, then I saw the faint line with a bunch of little moving objects.  It was a single silk thread with hundreds of spider hatchlings going down (most of the time) from their egg sac beneath the soffets to the top of the fence, and eventually, all over the yard and elsewhere.  Each one was maybe 2mm long.  At times they looked like a string of beads, and sometimes they would clump together, or spread out in some seemingly organized fashion.  Amazing to watch.  I got out my Nikon D70s and used my 60mm micro-Nikkor  and added the Nikon 6T diopter for some extra magnification.

I paid a dollar for it at the Recycle Reuse Center in Ann Arbor.  My daughter looked at me with disdain when I picked it up - \"That's such a piece of junk.\" She said (or something to that effect).  Well, I have a thing for these often-maligned little cameras.  For one, they usually have a fairly sharp lens.  Second, we all know it's the photographer, right?  Think about the usual target audience for these cameras -- people that use a camera for some special event or a trip to the zoo, etc.  All they know is they think they need to record the event, and hey, that camera is 6.99 -- it ought to do the trick.  Like legions of people before them, using box cameras from Kodak and Ansco, or plastic 127 cameras, and later still, Instamatics.  All for the same purpose - snapshots.

Some phoptographers  get so caught up in lens tests, resolution, edge to edge sharpness, and so on, that I sometimes wonder if they spend more time being gearheads than shooting.  Not that I don't like a sharp lens.  But sometimes, you want to capture something else -- a mood, or a feel, and in some cases, the image is a lot like our memory of an event.

Finally had the film processed and have scanned in a few prints.  This is an amazing cheap camera.  I paid $30 including shipping for mine at Design Within Reach on the web (DWR).  It weighs but a few ounces, and gives a 170 degree view.  Pure Fun.    Even though it has a viewfinder, it's mostly there to give you a vague idea of what the camera is pointing at.  It can focus from a few inches to infinity in the same shot.  I have barely scratched the surface of its creative potential.  The camera also has a built-in flash -- which takes forever to charge, but not a big deal.  I know that some people will just think it's silly, but screw 'em.  The world needs more silliness of the good kind.  This camera will make you smile.Last night, I attended the first meeting of the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, for want of a better name.  There were five of us, and I can kick myself for not doing two things: 1. Getting the time right.  I thought all week it was at 7:30 for some reason, and when I got ready to head out, I saw that the note said 7 pm.  2. Find the address ahead of time.  I thought it was on Edgewood near Pittfield Village, so I went there.  No.  It was on Edgewood off Stadium.  WTF - why does Ann Arbor have two streets with identical names? OK, one is Edgewood Drive and the other Edgewood Ave.  My mistake.  Thankfully, Adrienne has a mini-phonebook in the car and I looked on the map to set myself straight.  I feel bad because I am usually the first person to arrive at such things, and missed a good half hour of getting to know the others.

Every once in a while, a truly special person comes into your life (aside from a spouse).  Bill Brudon -- artist, photographer, bibliophile, story teller, historian, and medical illustrator.  I met Bill years ago, but knew of him by reputaion long before that.  He was the Scientific Illustrator in the Museum of Zoology until about 21 years before I started work there.  His work was legendary.  Then, I met him at some museum function, and many years later, met him again when he was volunteering as an artist for the Ann Arbor Flower Show, which was being done by Matthaei Botanical Gardens.  He and my wife Adrienne became good buddies, and I would run into Bill frequently -- either at the gardens, or the flower show itself.  Sometime around 2000, Bill became aware of my renewed passion for photography , and started giving me tips about what to do, and seeing my enthusiasm grow, also provided me with cameras and lenses, and film.  Bill's roots in photography go back to when he used to develop sheet negatives for his father, who was also an illustrator and photographer.  So, Bill knows his way around a darkroom, and his art background gives him a different perspective on photography.    Fast forward to 2002.  I find out that Bill and Margaret are thinking of moving to a retirement community in Chelsea, MI.  I was of course, saddened, because stopping at Bill's on the way back from work had become commonplace, and whether it was to shoot the breeze for a few minutes, or hear his \"hey, young fella\" followed by \" how would you like one of these?\" whereupon he might pass along a candy, a roll of film, or a lens.. I never knew what to expect, but his enthusiasm for looking over my progress never waned.  Well, it so happened that Bill and Margaret's home was a dream home for us, and we ended up buying it from them in 2002.  In the span of a couple of days, we helped them move out, moved in, cleaned up our old house so the buyers could move in to it the next day.  That was just a whirlwind of activity, that I am still amazed that it all happened the way it did.The house came with extras -- a fully furnished darkroom, a film fridge, a few more cameras, and a lot of photography books.  Each time I use the darkroom, I imagine Bill there at some point.  Bill and Margaret are still in Chelsea, and I talk to him frequently on the phone, and make a trip over every once in a while.  If there is one regret that I have, is that I did not know Bill before throat cancer took away his once-beautiful voice.  Luckily, he still does have a voice, though it is raspy...  Make that two regrets -- it would have been fun to have spent a week on a photography safari with him on Beaver Island.Here's to Bill.  I call him Dad because he's like father to me, and will always appreciate the many ways he has enriched my life."},

I have about 300 feet of it in my fridge, so at the rate I am using it now, it will last a long time.  Yesterday, I decided to shoot a roll in my daughter's Olympus 35RC -- a sweet little rangefinder camera that I covet.  She's away in Austria with her orchestra from Huron High.  Perfect opportunity to use the camera, especially since I replaced the dead battery.Techpan is a slow film,  -- iso 25 for pictorial use, and I developed the film in Technidol LC -- recommended for pictorial use with a wide tonal scale.  I am very impressed with the camera, the film, and it scans really easily.  I scanned some negs at 2800 ppi, and still could not see any grain.  It prints really nicely, too.You can find more info on the Olympus 35RC here and here."},

I forgot to see if she was still there when I closed the door an hour or so later.  Of course, as soon as I heard her plaintive meow, I opened the door and she came running out, very distressed.  I also knew that if she had been in there for almost 24 hours, a mess was going to be there.  Actually, she's a very fastidious cat, so the the mess was confined to a foam anti-fatigue mat on the tile floor.  That got tossed, and I scrubbed down the floor, too.  While I was at it, I took out all of the plastic and glass bottles, put the good empty ones in boxes, tossed the cruddy ones, and took stock of what I had under the sink.  Threw out a few other things, too, such as some 16x20 plastic trays that had never been used but had gone very brittle.

For some time, I have thought about trying to use the \"folgernol\" or \"caffeinol\"   recipe to develop some black and white film.  I have been seriously developing my own film for about six years, and have used a variety of commercial developers, mostly sticking with D-76, HC-110, Rodinal, and Diafine.  The attraction to using caffeinol is that it goes against my gut instinct... why in hell would someone use instant coffee to develop film?  In addition, the low-toxicity and the ability to have good shadow detail with the developer is a plus.The formula is presented here:2 tsp washing soda (Sodium carbonate) 4 tsp instant coffe (I used Maxwell house) 1 gram vitamin C (1 finely gound 1000 mg tablet) 8 oz water I shot a roll of Ilford FP4+ (125 iso) and developed the film in the caffeinol for 15 minutes at 74°F, agitating every minute.  I think the results were good... in fact, the negatives were pretty dense, so I think I will adjust the time to be a few minutes shorter next time.  The beauty of this developer is that it uses ingredients that are common and easy to mix.  Something to think about in the years ahead when the big companies reduce the choice of developers."},

This was a quick scan done on a flatbed scanner, not my film scannner, and made into a duotone in Photoshop. I wanted to have the water blurred, and yet the branch in relatively good focus.  I shot it with my Nikon FM2N on a tripod with a cable release and a 70-200mm Vivitar zoom lens.  The exposure was probably something like f16 at 1/2 second.  I never record that information.

A single leaf lay at one end.  Pure photographic nirvana.  If I had brought a long a tripod, I would have spent more time, but i did fire off a dozen shots or so to capture the beauty of that small area.

I think I paid about $12 for it, and I was rewarded with some pretty decent images on some J&C Pro 100 film.Here is the camera:The image shown is from the Frieze Building at the Huron Street side, where you can see the vestiges of the old Carnegie Library.   It's important to record this particular building, as the University is planning to tear it down this year to build a new dorm and student center there.  I'm not particularly fond of most of the Frieze Building, which used to be known as Ann Arbor High School.  A lot of it is really bad add-ons from the 1960s.  The core building is actually pretty interesting, but has suffered from typical lack of upkeep.One thing about using a cmera that takes square format images, is that you never have to worry about whether the shot will look better as a vertical or a horizontal image.  What is there, is there in the viewfinder.  Some people shoot with the intent to crop later.  Not me, I am always thinking full frame when I shoot."},
{"title": "Weston Show follow-up", "date": "Monday, January 09, 2006", "text": "Follow Art    Originally uploaded by argusmaniac. Yesterday, Marjorie, Andrea, and Matt accompanied me to the Edward Weston exhibit (see previous post) at the Muskegon Museum of Art.  For once, we had great weather for such a trip, especially considering that it is January.  The sun and relatively warm temperatures (about 35 deg. F) made it seem more like a day in March than the beginning of the year.The MMA is a grand marble building, and admission is only 4 bucks, which is quite amazing.  The Weston exhibit is a travelling show, and the gallery for it was really wonderful, with my only criticism being that some sections could have used more light.  The selection of Weston images went from his early pictorialist style to his Point Lobos days.  I was amazed to find that some of his early nudes were contact prints from 2.25\" x 3.25\" negatives.   What was most enthralling to us was the transformation of Weston's ability to capture form and present everyday objects and landscapes in a way that made them viewable either as abstractions not just as nudes, landcapes, or still lifes.  He must have seen the sensuality and universality of curves  - whether it was a pepper, nautilus shell, dunes, or Charis' body.   To see so many of his photographs superbly matted and framed -- all in 16 x 20 mats (4 ply) in black wood frames, was just an awesome experience.   They were often grouped by the period or the subject matter, and the groupings were well-planned.  The only odd thing in the show were two separate small exhibits of cameras.  Now, you know I am a camera geek, and one exhibit implied the cameras that Weston would have used, such as the 5x7 portrait Graflex. Another display had several Kodak box cameras and a Disc camera!  No explanation about the cameras or their significance (other than their original prices and that they came from the local historical museum), which makes me wonder about why they included them.  Overall, the Life Work show of Weston is a great exhibit that I recommend to anyone with an interest in photography.  If you want to see the breadth of one of our greatest photographers, this is the show."},
{"title": "Edward Weston in Muskegon", "date": "Friday, January 06, 2006", "text": "I only found out about this because of an article in the Ann Arbor News.  The Muskegon Museum of Art is holding a major Weston retrospective, which began on Dec. 10 and runs until Feb. 5. Edward Weston: Life Work  promises to be a really nice exhibit, and I am driving there Sunday, along with some other local photographers.  It should be a fun day. In case you don't know -- I think very highly of Edward Weston's work.  His breadth of subjects and attention to detail is unsurpassed by anyone else during his era.  He managed to produce a large body of work, often under penurious conditions. Nonetheless, his fame slowly spread, and like many artists, his recognition in the larger art world came late in his life.  He was not a self-promoter, and although early on he made a living as a portrait photographer, he really wanted to be free of that, and produce real art.  Whereas Ansel Adams is the acknowleged master of western landscapes, especially Yosemite, Weston was a master of still lifes, landscapes, and form.  He didn't just photograph his subjects, he sometimes slept with them, and in the case of Charis Wilson, married one.  Weston's breakthroughs seems to take place when he was in emotional turmoil -- whether in Mexico with Tina Modotti, or later, with Charis.  I use turmoil not in a bad way here.  His passions stirred, they transferred to his art, too.  Guggenheim grants allowed him to finally work and do his thing, and he and Charis travelled many miles across the USA to photograph for several projects. Weston was a true artist -- he strived to get just the right image, and probably threw out many times more sheets of film than he kept. He kept his workflow simple.  The final image was the thing.  He kept at something until he got it right.  He was never the teacher and experimenter that Ansel was, but he was a master of his craft.  There has been a lot written about Weston, but perhaps some of the best writings came from his own Daybooks, edited by Nancy Newhall.  Ben Maddow's biography is a must read. Charis Wilson's biography is a wonderfully written book, too.  One other amazing legacy from Weston is that all his sons were artistic, and Brett, his most famous son, was also a fine photographer.  The legacy lives on with Kim Weston, who lives in Carmel, and carries on the family tradition of excellence in photography.It's hard to pick a favorite photo, since Weston did so many that I like.  If I were to have a wish granted that I could have any print that I wanted, which one would it be?  I suppose it would have to be Head Down Nude, 1936 that has Charis with one knee up, her head down, and hands wrapped around her lower knee.  A beautiful study in form and shadow. She's nude, but nothing's really showing.   I am looking forward to seeing the exhibit Sunday.  While we are there, we hope to do some photography in Muskegon.  Nothing that will rival Weston, but we probably will all come home thinking we shot at least one masterpiece.  That's probably what Weston would have thought, too."},

A great time for black and white photography, whether you are using film,  or... ahem, digital.It's a good time to look at form and shape and subtleties of how the snow makes things look diffferent.  Sometimes more beautiful than they were before.  Sometimes uglier, too, especially when the slush piles around things.The photo here was taken several years ago with one of my Argus C-3 cameras with a roll of Kodak C-41 b&w.  Using a manual camera in the winter is a good idea.  Batteries can get cold and leave your caamera a useless piece of machinery.  But, here are some tips to help with winter shooting:1. Keep your batteries warm or carry an extra set if you are going to outside for more than a few hours, especially if the temperature is below 20 degress F.2. Carry a plastic bag to put your camera into when you come inside so that moisture does not condense all over your camera and optics.3. If you are metering a scene that is snow covered -- compensate your exposure by at least +1.  That is, if your meter says f16 at 1/125,  shoot at f11 at 1/125 or f16 at 1/60.  Your meter will underexpose a pure white scene by at least 1 or 2 stops, so you can also dial that in as +1 or +2 on many cameras, film or digital, unless you are shooting in manual mode.4. If you are using a tripod -- put a length of foam pipe insulation over the base section of the legs so you won't freeze your hands. It will be a couple of bucks well spent.5. Black and White Films -- Try some Ilford Pan F 50 for fine-grained results. Some people advise shooting it at an ISO of 32.  See what works for you.Another good film to try is Fuji Neopan 1600 for those low-light evening shots, interiors, etc.  Fun stuff to play with.Have fun, and remember Dec. 21 is the Winter SOLSTICE.

{"title": "What I want for Christmas!", "date": "Friday, November 25, 2005", "text": "Now that the holiday frenzy has started, beginning with what retailers call \"Black Friday\", it is only fitting that I post my very short Christmas list.  Yesterday's paper came with dozens of inserts from retailers, wanting my dollars on gifts that for the most part, don't do much for me... My want list:1. Peace on Earth  2. Democracy and integrity in our government3. Nikon D70sThe first two items I can forget, since it's wishful thinking, and anyway, they would never be delivered on time for Christmas. Santa just can only do so much.  Item three, though... hmmm.  I think that Santa (and I know my Santa is a female) could probably fit this item into her sleigh.  It's lightweight (the camera, not the sleigh), powerful, and with the 18-55mm lens, I will be pretty well set with a complement of lenses, as I am covered with all my other AF lenses at home.  Why the more expensive D70s instead of the less-pricey D50?  Well, Santa, you see, the D50 uses SD memory cards, instead of the CF cards that the D70s and all our other digital cameras in the house use. Buying enough SD cards would eat up another couple of hundred dollars, and introduce another memory card format to complicate matters.  The D70s has other functions, such as depth-of-field preview that a photographer like me needs for macro work.  The special white balance functions are essential, too. The D70 is a fast, versatile DSLR that has a bunch of great features that will allow me to use all my older flashes, too.  So, yes, the D70s is the camera for me.A couple of sites have some excellent reviews.  I love Ken Rockwell's site -- he's an avid Nikon user, and his review is based on a real user's perspective, not a generalist review or something from a photo magazine.   DPreview  is another good site with in-depth reviews of lots of other cameras, too.So, if you are finally looking to buy a DSLR, I think the time has come.  Price/features are really something.  Yes, a new film SLR is still cheaper (though not for guys like me -- a Nikon F6 is more expensive than the D70s).  I am NOT abandoning film -- b&w and classic cameras are still a heck of a lot of fun, as is Medium Format.  However, for color work, I think digital has largely won over many.  I have greatly enjoyed my Fuji FinePix S7000 over the past year -- I have probably shot close to 10,000 images, if not more.  But, I miss the ability to use a lot of my fine lenses and macro gear that I can use with my Nikon cameras.  In addition, the ability to shoot at f/1.8 if I want or at f/22, is a big advantage of a DSLR over a fixed-lens camera like the FinePix.So, Santa, I hope you feel generous this year.  I'll even put a some extras out for you..."},

Doesn't bother me... we usually stay home.Shooting in winter presents a whole new range of photographic opportunities, as well as challenges.  Keeping ourselves warm and dry...and keeping our camera gear dry.  Most of the vibrant colors of the other seasons are missing from our landscape, and when we find those colors, they contrast so well with snow.    In addition, the daylength is oh so short.  For those of us that like to shoot after work, forget it... it's dark when I leave for home.    So, weekends and days off become more important for outdoor shooting.  That raking light of the somewhat diminished sun makes great shadows on the landscape.  Dark clouds behind front-lit trees.  Black and white compositions  with snow and trees.  Lots of things to shoot if you just look.If you are not the cold-weather type -- try doing still-lifes inside.  There are lots of subjects to try out, and it's a good time to try using different lighting techniques and backgrounds, as well as different lenses and accessories.  Have a great Thanksgiving."},

If you are the parent of a child that is a high school senior this fall, then you have undoubtedly received mail from local photo studios looking for your dollars.  A LOT of dollars.

She sees through the charade of salesmanship to know that you do not have to spend between $500 and $2000 to get your senior portraits done.  She's lucky, and so am I, since I am a photographer, and so is Marjorie.  I don't wish to demean other photographers -- they are in a business to make money, and that is their only job.  So, whatever angle they put on taking senior portraits to make a buck and support their families is fine.  But, I know I can take portraits, too. I spent a few hours over two days shooting her in several locations.  She wanted b&w only.  I shot mostly with digital -- in b&w, too.  She could look at the screen afterwards while I was shooting and decide if she liked what I was getting.  For the most part, I was amazed when I saw the images on my computer and then printed out.  She was no longer the \"kid\"  -- I was  taking portraits of a young woman at the beginning of a new phase in her life.

{"title": "Kodak Paper, 1887-2005, R.I.P.", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2005", "text": "Back on June 16, 2005, Eastman Kodak announced that it was \"discontinuing\" the production of its silver-based black and white printing paper.  Kodak said it will stop production of the b&W paper at the end of this year. But the world’s biggest film manufacturer will continue to make black-and-white film and chemicals for processing. As the industry shifts rapidly from chemical-based to digital imaging, \"demand for black-and-white paper is declining about 25 per cent annually and Kodak could no longer justify being in the market\", Kodak spokesman David Lanzillo said.  Thus ends over a century of Kodak's production of black and white paper.  Kodak’s original papers were made for “paper negatives” but for printing positives, they marketed a printing out paper (POP) that was used to make contact prints from larger negatives.  Most missed by today’s fine-art printers will be some specialty papers, such as their Azo and Polycontrast Fine Art papers.  The bulk of Kodak’s paper production is for the commercial photofinisher market, which uses little of no true b&w paper. However, as a practicing black and white photographer, I confess that I rarely use Kodak paper, instead buying papers made by Ilford and others.  Kodak's decision will undoubtedly convince some that the death-knell of film is upon us, and the death rattle of 35mm film cassettes can be heard in the shadows.  I disagree.  Kodak's problem is that they are trying to become the Digital Imaging Company the way they were the Film and Paper Company.  Unfortunately, there are many competitors in this arena, and Kodak will be slugging it out with Fuji, Canon, HP, Kyocera, Nikon, Konica-Minolta, etc.    Dumping their b&w paper production is probably not the big loss that some think it is -- Ilford, Forte, Kentmere and others will be afforded what market remains, and they will fill it in a manner more beneficial to photography enthusiasts.  Here is what Kodak should think about doing -- spin off the silver-halide part of the company and call it Yellow-Box Classic or something, and have it become more of a niche company, catering to the Fine art and amateur world.  Sure, very few commercial photographers are using b&w paper and film any more, but that does not mean there is no market. The big unanswered question here is -- what will Kodak do next?  There will always be a market for silver-based photography.  Whether the product has Kodak's name on the box or Lucky Film from China remains to be seen."},

It was (is?) made to produce reverse text slides with a blue background.  Therefore, it's a hi-res and hi-contrast film.  Also slower than molasses with an ISO of between 8 and 10.  I was given a couple of packs of it -- each package has one roll of film and a processsing cartridge.  You expose the film and put it and the developer cartridge into the Polaroid Autoprocessor unit..turn the cranks, and voila! in 5 minutes you have developed film that can be used for slides.  A great idea for quick slides in the pre-digital photography world -- I recall using this film in the early 1980s for a presentation. Now however, PolaBlue is an anachronism. I don't know if it is still being sold.  The film had an expiration date of 1992, so I figured that I would try a roll out as a slow pictorial film and go for the weird effects.  Before I tried it out on something that took planning, I tried a roll out in my yard. To be honest, I am amazed that it was still working.  So what you see here is a shot of a dragonfly lawn ornament.  The really cool effect was after I scanned the slide and inverted it in Photoshop. That gave me this image.

It's basically a retrospective of James Agee's and Evans' collaborative work, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, which appeared in book form in 1941.  I always liked Walker Evans' images, and there is a good  biography of him by James R. Mellow.  The Agee-Evans venture is an interesting book, and I think without Evans' images, Agee's prose would lack the impact that's provided by the photographs.  It's hard to imagine that sharecroppers could be so dirt poor, and in the context of the Great Depression, maybe they weren't quite so bad off as some.  And I have to wonder -- if white sharecroppers were that bad off, how bad did African-Americans have it?

{"title": "Female Photographers and Self-nudes", "date": "Wednesday, August 24, 2005", "text": "Originally uploaded by aikitherese. I have come to the conclusion that some of the best nudes I have seen have been self-portraits by women. On flickr, you can certainly find plenty of nudes -- as well as on other photo sites. As a bona fide art form, the nude has a long history. Most artists were men, thus nude females as a subject were always from the male viewpont. As photographers started doing nudes, they were at first photographing similar subjects and settings as some of the paintings done by their painting forebears.Enter Edward Weston and Imogene Cunningham, who in my opinion, photographed some of the best nudes. Weston's were sometimes abstract, but always sensual, and I think were always very positive images. Cunningham's images were of a variety of women, sometimes soft, other times abstract, but again, always strong images. Since then, how many photographers have shot nudes? Tens of Thousands? How many ways can one show the female (or male) form? Millions? Almost always, there has been the photographer and the model -- two minds. Is the product that we see because of the photographer or is it good because of the model? I suspect that if we based an image on glamour or sex appeal alone, rather than the body as a landscape,we might have differeing viewpoints on that. But, what if the subject and the photographer are one and the same? Then, the image becomes a personal statement combining the emotions and physical attributes of the model with the technology and photographic abililty of the model. Until digital, the best instant feedback one could get for such self-images was a Polaroid. Not really well-suited for most serious photographers. You still had to wait a while to see the results. With digital, one can view the image via the LCD remotely (for those with flip-up screens) or at least see it immediately afterwards. The mood of the shot, positioning, and so one, do not get disrupted. The photographer then adjusts her position to get exactly what she desired in the shot. Easy? I wish it were so, because if it were that easy, anyone could do it. It still takes - vision, persistence, talent, and a thick skin. You are not just the photographer, you are the model. There are many talented female photographers that do self-portraits on flickr (www.flickr.com). I am pointing out one that goes by the screen name of aikitherese. Her self-nudes are sensitive, dynamic, expressive, and just damn good photography. Sometimes they remind me of Weston, Stieglitz, or Modotti. Overall, many of them could hang in a gallery somewhere. Take a look --aikithereseI don't believe I could shoot anywhere near as good a nude as those Therese does of herself. I certainly could never capture myself the way she does -- and I would not even attempt it. So, is it the photographer or the model that makes a great nude? Sometimes they are one and the same and you can't separate them.."},
{"title": "MONTE NAGLER'S MICHIGAN", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2005", "text": "The University of Michigan's Museum of Art is currently showing about 20 images from Monte Nagler, an accomplished large-format photographer. It's showcasing his newest book, published by the UM Press - Monte Nagler's Michigan ( here). The black and white photographs are mostly landscapes, and true to his Ansel Adams background, only one has a person in it. However, this is Monte Nagler's Michigan -- not mine or yours. His photos are beautiful, and as an admirer of his work, I would love to have any of them hanging on my wall -- especially the one of the inside of the Capitol dome in Lansing. I met Mr. Nagler about 5 years ago at an event in Ann Arbor. He's easy to talk to, and at that time, I was just getting back into photography and taking it seriously. It's good to see that someone can make a mid-life career change like he did, and be successful at it. Unlike a lot of photographers schooled by Ansel Adams, Monte has focused on areas other than the Western US. His landscape work is wide-ranging, and very popular.  His Michigan is presented in such a way that you know he loves his home state, and we are lucky to have a person of his caliber recognized by the Governor as a \"state treasure.\" The images at the UMMA are downstairs in what is called the \"Paper Gallery\" I call it the purgatory gallery because it's dimly lit, and is really just a hallway past the bathrooms and leads into office spaces. They usually have photo exhibits down there, unless it's a major showing on the second floor, like they did with Manuel Alvarez Bravo a few years ago. Hopefully, when the UMMA gets their addition, photography will be displayed more prominently there.     As the Stomach Churns    Originally uploaded by argusmaniac.

How many books are too many?  Specifically, how many photography books are too many?  I guess there is only the limit of space.  In my house, I have about 30+ shelf feet of photography books.  Some of them are classic works by famous photographers, some of them are booklets from Kodak, camera manuals, collector's guides, darrkroom hints, technical manuals, and others are just page after page of beautiful images.  Why do I collect them?  My interest in photography is wide-ranging.  I love the history of the medium, the personalities of many of the greats, and of course, for every famous photographer now dead, there are bound to be a number of biographies about him or her.  Ansel Adams, known as Saint Ansel by many, led a fairly straight life.  Not too many skeletons in his closet... but Edward Weston! A complex man that was inspired by many things, photographed many things, and many women.  His existing daybooks, compiled by Nancy Newhall, make for interesting reading.  One of his loves, Tina Modotti, herslef a famous photographer in her brief career, is also the subject of a fine biography.  She too, was a very complex persona.  Banned from Mexico because of her Communist activities (really it was a trumped up murder charge, but it was really because of her stirring up the masses), she  spent an exciting life abroad as a Communist agent of sorts, and eventually returned to Mexico.  A movie could be made of her life.Okay, I really got off on a tangent there, but the point is, a photograph is not merely a photograph.  It's also a manifestation of the photographer's mind and heart.  I'm not talking about birthday snapshots, but serious photography.  Many of the books I have featuring images by a single photographer are sort of like glimpses into their selves and beliefs.So, of all my photography books, which are my favorites?

Even more so, as a testament to the tobacco-induced brown coverings that coat the homes and lungs of smokers.This sepia effect was done in iPhoto.

Last night I was eager to do some shooting of our Mertensia - (Virginia Bluebells) in our garden.  Our backyard is basically a woodland wildflower garden with an overstory of hickory and oak.  By the time I was able to do some shooting it was nearly dark.  In addition, we have the disappointing weather forecast of snow this weekend -- after 78Â° on Tuesday.  I figured that I had better just cut one of the flower stalks and bring it inside and do some shooting studio-style.  I'm glad I did -- Mertensia is really a tough one to photograph well.  It's fairly low to the ground - bright light washes it out, and if windy, you can't get great depth of field. So, I set it up on a table with a black velvet backdrop, used a cheap  vivitar strobe behind a white umbrella, and small mirror to reflect light from below to capture the details. Fuji Finepix S7000 with +4 diopter, 1/25  (or so) @ f8. I like this setup so much, I think I'll do more flower portraits this way."},
{"title": "What Would Steiglitz Say?", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2005", "text": "WWSS?    Originally uploaded by argusmaniac. I took this photo yesterday -- we finally had some clouds after about a week of pure blue skies.  I used a Red 25A filter on the front of my Fuji Finepix S7000.  To do this, you need to buy the tubular adapter (sold by a number of manufacturers) so that you can use screw-on filters in front of the lens.  Actually, this is a good idea even if you don't use filters, because the tube gives you something to hold onto, and it protects the lenses.  Mine has a 52mm filter thread, so a lot of my filters fit without any step-up/down rings.  It also allows me to attach a diopter in front of the lens for better macro shots, too.  In this example, I used the camera in Black & White mode, which is what I always do when I take b&w photos with it.  Since it is an EVF camera, the viewfinder is in b&w too, and that is helpful when evaluating tones in the photo.  The red filter darkens the blue sky and makes the clouds stand out.  As for the title, What Would Steiglitz Say? -- it's a bit tongue in cheek.  I never really thought much of Steiglitz's series of photos, The Equivalents, which are a bunch of 4x5 cloud photos.  Not there there is anything technically wrong with them, I just think they received more adulation than they deserved.  I saw the set of those photos last year at an exhibit at the UM Museum of Art.  Perhaps at the time Steiglitz took them, nobody else thought of photographing clouds.  Perhaps its just because they were done by Steiglitz.  To me, they underscore that when Steiglitz took them, his most creative  (photographically) years were behind him.  But that is what happens when one is a legend.  Everything you do becomes valuable, whether it was good or not in the first place.  I still think Steiglitz was a true pioneer in his field, and he did much to advance the acceptance of photography as an art form, and of course, his introduction of modern art to the US is undeniably a huge accomplishment.  But let's just say I am ambivalent about his Equivalents..."},

Sometimes all can be in a single image.  Wandering the back roads of Michigan and anywhere in America, one can find something that falls into those categories.Marjorie suggested that we go and travel to the western part of Michigan where we really have not explored much.  So, on March 31--a gloomy day that was blustery and raining at times, we set off in search of old movie houses and  Americana.  We stopped in Marshall, Battle Creek, ate lunch in Otsego, saw a beautiful downtown Allegan, a wonderful barn full of antiques north of South Haven, saw a decrepit cinema in Niles, right next to a wonderful city hall; then stopped in Edwardsburg Michigan; White Pigeon; Sturgis, Bronson, and then home.  On the road for 12 hours, and we saw a lot that we did not photograph.  Because of the weather, I decided that it was going to be too gloomy for good black & white work, so I shot color via my Fuji Finepix S7000.  Marjorie used her Nikon FM with slide and color negative film.It will be interesting comparing our photos.

Otherwise, it would have been in a very sad state within a few years.  The barn is now pretty well cleaned up inside, and I shot this photo with my Nikon F4, mounted on a tripod, and in aperture priority mode.

{"title": "Depth of Field", "date": "Saturday, February 19, 2005", "text": "Poppy Pods    Originally uploaded by argusmaniac. One of the harder things to teach new photographers is depth of field (DOF) and out of focus (OOF) considerations when making a photograph.  DOF is controlled largely by the aperture, however, the exposure characteristics must be taken into account.  Good DOF depends on a small aperture, hence a slower shutter speed.  The focal length of the lens determines how much of the background will be in focus.  Obviously, if you want foreground and background to be in focus, you go for a wide-angle lens.  If you want a great OOF background, then opt for a telephoto.  In this case, I used my Tamron 80-200mm zoom with a 2x diopter to get these poppy seed capsules close-up, yet rendering the background soft and OOF. Aperture was probably f16.  I used a tripod and a lens shade, too.  Image was made on Fuji Astia."},

Some of my favorite photos have been taken under foggy conditions.  Whether it is mist rising from the surface of a lake, or heavy fog inundating the landscape, such conditions are a great challenge to capture the way we see them.   The first thing you have to do is forget any auto-exposure mode.  Otherwise, your shots will come out overexposed.  Digitally, go to manual mode and bracket your exposures by shutter speed, keeping the same aperture. With film cameras, do the same, but you will want to overexpose for b&w, because you are trying to capture shadow detail.You will also want to use a tripod or monopod, because your shutter speeds will be slower - and if you are doing landscapes, a tripod really is a necessity, anyway...so use one!This photo was shot at 1/6 sec at f8 with my FujiFinePix S7000, on a tripod.

But -- the AF leaves something to be desired, and I would actually rather have MF.  A rangefinder camera tends to be easily focused manually, and in many instances all one needs to do is set at f16 and prefocus to 10 feet, and you are all set for quick shooting.  Sadly, the G1 does not do this easily.  In low light levels, the camera really takes too long to focus.  You can focus manually, but it really is focus by wire, as there is no turning the lens barrel to focus, but you fiddle with the wheel on top of the camera and look at the readout in the viewfinder.  Nowhere as easy as aligning split images in the viewfinder.  As a posh P&S, it's a great camera.  I would trade it in a second for a Voigtlander Bessa R!"},

The old 1930s and 40s- era magazines were really fun to leaf through. I picked up a wonderful hard-bound copy of Wright Morris' \"Photographs and Words\" published by The Friends of Photography.\rFor more information on Wright Morris:\rhttp://www.photogenesisgallery.com/morris.html\rhttp://mockingbird.creighton.edu/ncw/morribib.htm\r\rAs collectors and photographers, we delight in going up and own the ailes checking out the various cameras, odd pieces of equipment, and chatting with the sellers and other photographers.  Marjorie once again outdid me, though this time I was not really actively buying anything.  She picked up another Argus C, An Argus C3, and Argus AF, and a C2.  My only Argus purchases were a pretty decent C2 in a case for $5, and an Argus slide viewer and a handful of Argus 126 cameras for $5.

Digital cameras were not for sale there, and I felt somewhat guilty snapping pics with a digicam...but these are web-destined anyway, not on my wall.  The MiPHS swap differs from other camera shows in another way, too -- there are many image vendors there, so if you are looking for tintypes, ambrotypes, Deguerreotypes or old photos, it is a great swap to attend. I never know what I'll see at this swap, and even if I don't buy the odd camera, many sellers understand that it's all about showing off, too.  The rare 16mm micro-camera from Universal Camera with gigantic flash reflector (by comparison) was a neat camera that i had read about but never seen.

For you urbanites and suburbanites, this may not mean much.  However, to those of us that grew up in the rural areas, a barn is much more than some old building sitting on a farm. Or, as more likely today, an old decrepit building at the edge of a housing development... it pains me to see them falling over.  Too expensive to maintain, the owners just let them rot away.\rBarns, in all their incarnations, were places where many of us played as kids.  Going up into the hayloft where we could search for cats, play hide and seek and get thoroughly messy with hay.  There was an old long-unused barn where I grew up (in the Adirondacks) and a rope was still attached to the hay pulley.  My friends and I would swing from that thing like we were Tarzan.  It's a wonder nobody got hurt.  It was also a neat place just to search for old stuff, and the old manure pile behind it was a rich source of compost for our gardens. The barn is still standing, so far as I know, but even then it had probably been abandoned for 20 years. \rNow I live in southern Michigan, and a 10 minute drive from my house gets me close to barns.  Some are still being used -- either as integral parts of a farming operation, or as nothing more than hay/vehicle storage; others are standing and unused, and each year, many more are leaning and falling over in disuse and disrespect. Still, there is are amazing variety of barns here -- a flagstone barn near Chelsea, one made of glazed tiles near Saline, and of course a lot of wood barns that look like the same group of builders built them 100 years ago or thereeabouts. Most of them are painted red with white accents. \rThere is a really nice book on Michigan barns, by Mary Keithan - Michigan Heritage Barns. All her shots were done with an 8x10 view camera, and her images have caused me to go out and find some of the barns she has photographed.  If you are interested in barn preservation, a number of states have preservation programs.\r\rI saw this barn outside of Hastings, MI a couple of years ago and did not photograph it.  This past July, I drove back home from Kalamazoo and took the back roads, and retraced my route to take me past this barn so I could get some shots of it.  I think it is a 10-sided barn. \r\r\rWhether they are regularly maintained or left to the ravages of the elements, barns are great photographic subjects.

The expiration date is late 1960s.  What the hell, I might as well load a roll in this camera and see what happens."},

One day my daughter and I were walking around Ann Arbor at lunchtime, as we often have, and of course, we are always photographing things.  A wrought-iron fence along the edge of a business property had this Rudbeckia growing through it.  It caught my eye and I photographed it with my Ricoh Six floding camera.  This camera has a removeable mask to allow either 6x6 cm or 6.4.5 cm negs on 120 roll film.  I paid $40 for it earlier this summer at a camera swap.  I like wrought-iron fences.  Decorative, yet tough. Sturdy yet you can see through them.  Short, and they are just a reminder where the edge of the property is. Tall, and they seem to fence you out or in, depending where you are."},

Not only that, every pepper in the market today is \"perfect\".  No outlandish forms like Weston purchased. Maybe someone needs to market a variety that is prone to unusual shapes and call them Westons. Plus, in his day, they didn't sell them with little PLU stickers on the side..."},

In fact, take a look at any of the larger camera mags such as Shutterbug and Popular Photography.  They make their living showcasing the latest stuff.  Now it's about 75% digital.    Now there is nothing wrong with digital photography, but there is a lot wrong with the industry.  Ilford and Agfa, both primarily film-based companies, seems to be having problems.  Kodak is dropping some films, such as Technical Pan - a very unique film emulsion.  Kodak's bread and butter has been film and the processing thereof.  What happens as consumers go more digital -- what kind of consumables can Kodak provide to a digital user besides ink-jet paper?  Are they going to have stock in Epson, too?  Sell Kodak-branded media cards?  How many latest models of digicams can a person buy?  \r\rBack to my original topic - digital has no soul.  I pick up one of my many classic cameras, and some not so classic -- they have a feel and ease of operation that digital cannot approach.  No batteries except for a light meter (and even then, that only accounts for my SLRS and a Pentax 6X7).  See the subject in the viewfinder..press the shutter. Instant capture of the moment forever. Not to be erased by mistake, not left on a CD never to be seen again, not processed a thousand ways in photoshop.  A unique image preserved in silver salts on a strip of acetate.  You can look at it without any technological aid now, 100 years from now.  That's why I say digital has no soul.\r\rWhat do I use?  Film.  My digicam is a 2.1 MP for web and ebay.  I shoot over a hundred rolls of b&w in a year - some medium format, most 35mm.  Maybe I'll start using the 4x5 camera I have, too.   I guess its time to buy a bunch of bulk rolls of b&w to keep Kodak going, huh?  \r\rIf you like b&w, try JandC Photo on the web....some neat emulsions , mostly all from Europe.       cemetery1    Originally uploaded by argusmaniac. Here is the image.. I finally figured out the whole Flickr thing...pretty cool actually.next Saturday, October 23 is World Toy Camera Day.  Take a toy camera anywhere and shoot some photos.  Toy cameras? \rgo to http://www.toycamera.com/wtcd/wtcd_info.html\rfor more info on WTCD.\r\rMy favoriye toy camera?  My Holga, of course.  It frees me from thinking about controls and more about spur of the moment, \"what if\" kind experience.    \rSuch as this.\r\r\r\rA cemetery on Mackinac island, MI.  I was there in mid-August, on a beautiful day.  This old cemetery has interesting cobblestone arches and iron gates.  \r\r--------"}
